M0,10.1111/jcpp.12053,Annual Research Review: Resilience and mental health in children and adolescents living in areas of armed conflict - a systematic review of findings in low- and middle-income countries,"Researchers focused on mental health of conflict-affected children are increasingly interested in the concept of resilience. Knowledge on resilience may assist in developing interventions aimed at improving positive outcomes or reducing negative outcomes, termed promotive or protective interventions.We performed a systematic review of peer-reviewed qualitative and quantitative studies focused on resilience and mental health in children and adolescents affected by armed conflict in low- and middle-income countries.Altogether 53 studies were identified: 15 qualitative and mixed methods studies and 38 quantitative, mostly cross-sectional studies focused on school-aged children and adolescents. Qualitative studies identified variation across socio-cultural settings of relevant resilience outcomes, and report contextually unique processes contributing to such outcomes. Quantitative studies focused on promotive and protective factors at different socio-ecological levels (individual, family-, peer-, school-, and community-levels). Generally, promotive and protective factors showed gender-, symptom-, and phase of conflict-specific effects on mental health outcomes.Although limited by its predominantly cross-sectional nature and focus on protective outcomes, this body of knowledge supports a perspective of resilience as a complex dynamic process driven by time- and context-dependent variables, rather than the balance between risk- and protective factors with known impacts on mental health. Given the complexity of findings in this population, we conclude that resilience-focused interventions will need to be highly tailored to specific contexts, rather than the application of a universal model that may be expected to have similar effects on mental health across contexts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study involved research assessments of two groups of Bosnian refugees: those who have not presented for mental health services and those who have. A total of 28 of 41 nonpresenters (70%) met symptom criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis. All service presenters (N = 29) met symptom criteria for PTSD diagnosis. The group that did not present for services reported substantial but lower trauma exposure, PTSD symptom severity, and depression symptom severity. They had significant differences on all subscales of the MOS SF-36, indicating better health status. We concluded that those who do not seek services have substantial symptom levels, but their self-concept appears to be less oriented toward illness and help seeking. Innovative access, engagement, and preventive interventions are needed to address those who have symptoms but do not readily seek help for trauma mental health services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been hypothesised to resemble panic disorder and is currently classified as an anxiety disorder in DSM-IV. However, there are only very few data available about the sensitivity of patients with PTSD to CO(2).In 10 patients with PTSD, 10 sex- and age-matched healthy subjects and 8 patients with panic disorder we assessed anxiety, panic, dissociative and PTSD symptoms before and after a single vital capacity inhalation of 35% CO(2).Patients with PTSD showed an increased anxiety, panic and dissociative reaction to the inhalation of 35% CO(2) compared to healthy participants. PTSD subjects' responses were indistinguishable from those of panic patients. Additionally, PTSD-typical symptoms like post-traumatic flashbacks were provoked in patients with PTSD after the inhalation of CO(2).In our sample, PTSD was associated with an increased CO(2) reactivity, pointing to an increased susceptibility of PTSD patients to CO(2) challenge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M3,10.4088/jcp.v69n1002,A Pooled Analysis of Gender and Trauma-Type Effects on Responsiveness to Treatment of PTSD With Venlafaxine Extended Release or Placebo,"To examine effects of gender and trauma type on response to treatment with venlafaxine extended release (ER) or placebo in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Data were pooled from 2 flexible-dose, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials: a 12-week trial conducted in the United States (March 2001 to December 2002) and a 24-week trial conducted in 12 countries outside the United States (October 2001 to December 2003). Six hundred eighty-seven outpatients with DSM-IV-diagnosed PTSD and a 17-item Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale abbreviated 1-week Symptom Status version (CAPS-SX-17) score > or = 60 were randomly assigned to treatment with venlafaxine ER (37.5 mg/day-300 mg/day, N = 340) or placebo (N = 347). The primary efficacy end point was the CAPS-SX-17 total score at week 12. Secondary end points included CAPS-SX-17 cluster scores for reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal and scores on the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale, Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17). Analysis-of-covariance models were used to test for differences by gender and trauma type (accidental injury, combat, nonsexual abuse, adult sexual abuse, childhood sexual abuse, unexpected death, and other), treatment (venlafaxine ER vs. placebo), and the treatment-by-trauma-type interaction.Using last-observation-carried-forward analysis, significant effects of treatment with venlafaxine ER were found on the CAPS-SX-17 total score and on all CAPS-SX-17 cluster scores and most other secondary measures. No significant treatment-by-gender interactions were observed. Trauma type significantly affected treatment responsiveness on symptom-related disability (SDS, p = .0057) and resilience (CD-RISC, p = .0012), with a nearly significant effect on depression (HAM-D-17, p = .0625).Overall, there does not appear to be a significant effect of gender on the efficacy of venlafaxine ER in the treatment of PTSD. Trauma type may affect treatment outcome but seems to affect domains such as disability and resilience more than core PTSD symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M4,10.1001/archpsyc.62.6.629,Twelve-Month Use of Mental Health Services in the United States,"Dramatic changes have occurred in mental health treatments during the past decade. Data on recent treatment patterns are needed to estimate the unmet need for services.To provide data on patterns and predictors of 12-month mental health treatment in the United States from the recently completed National Comorbidity Survey Replication.Nationally representative face-to-face household survey using a fully structured diagnostic interview, the World Health Organization's World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, carried out between February 5, 2001, and April 7, 2003.A total of 9282 English-speaking respondents 18 years and older.Proportions of respondents with 12-month DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse control, and substance disorders who received treatment in the 12 months before the interview in any of 4 service sectors (specialty mental health, general medical, human services, and complementary and alternative medicine). Number of visits and proportion of patients who received minimally adequate treatment were also assessed.Of 12-month cases, 41.1% received some treatment in the past 12 months, including 12.3% treated by a psychiatrist, 16.0% treated by a non-psychiatrist mental health specialist, 22.8% treated by a general medical provider, 8.1% treated by a human services provider, and 6.8% treated by a complementary and alternative medical provider (treatment could be received by >1 source). Overall, cases treated in the mental health specialty sector received more visits (median, 7.4) than those treated in the general medical sector (median, 1.7). More patients in specialty than general medical treatment also received treatment that exceeded a minimal threshold of adequacy (48.3% vs 12.7%). Unmet need for treatment is greatest in traditionally underserved groups, including elderly persons, racial-ethnic minorities, those with low incomes, those without insurance, and residents of rural areas.Most people with mental disorders in the United States remain either untreated or poorly treated.

M5,10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.01.023,Rats exposed to traumatic stress bury unfamiliar objects — A novel measure of hyper-vigilance in PTSD models?,"Electric shocks lead to lasting behavioral deficits in rodents, and as such are often used to model post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the laboratory. Here we show that a single exposure of rats to 3 mA-strong shocks results in a marked social avoidance that lasts at least 28 days; moreover, the response intensifies over time. In an attempt to study the impact of cue reminders on the behavior of shocked rats, we administered shocks in the presence of a highly conspicuous, 10 cm-large object. This object was introduced into the home cage of rats 28 days after shock exposure. Shocked rats manipulated the object considerably less than controls. More importantly, however, the object was buried by shocked rats. This behavior was virtually absent in controls. The response strongly depended on the intensity of shocks, and was robust. Rats shocked with 3 mA currents spent 40% of time burying the object, which was often hardly visible at the end of the 5 min test. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the response was not cue-specific as unfamiliar objects were also buried. Rats are well known to bury dangerous objects; the shock-prod burying test of anxiety is based on this response. Behavioral similarities with this test and the differences from the marble-burying behavior of mice suggest that traumatized rats bury unfamiliar objects in defense, and the response can be interpreted as a sign of hyper-vigilance. We further suggest that object burying can be used as a sign of hyper-vigilance in models of PTSD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M6,10.1111/ner.12399,Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation for Comorbid Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder,"External stimulation of the trigeminal nerve (eTNS) is an emerging neuromodulation therapy for epilepsy and depression. Preliminary studies suggest it has an excellent safety profile and is associated with significant improvements in seizures and mood. Neuroanatomical projections of the trigeminal system suggest eTNS may alter activity in structures regulating mood, anxiety, and sleep. In this proof-of-concept trial, the effects of eTNS were evaluated in adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for these commonly co-occurring conditions.Twelve adults with PTSD and MDD were studied in an eight-week open outpatient trial (age 52.8 [13.7 sd], 8F:4M). Stimulation was applied to the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves for eight hours each night as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy. Changes in symptoms were monitored using the PTSD Patient Checklist (PCL), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-C), and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q).Over the eight weeks, eTNS treatment was associated with significant decreases in PCL (p = 0.003; median decrease of 15 points; effect size d 1.5), HDRS-17 (p < 0.001; 42% response rate, 25% remission; d 2.1), and QIDS-C scores (p < 0.001; d 1.8), as well as an improvement in quality of life (Q-LES-Q, p < 0.01). eTNS was well tolerated with few treatment emergent adverse events.Significant improvements in PTSD and depression severity were achieved in the eight weeks of acute eTNS treatment. This novel approach to wearable brain stimulation may have use as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy in these disorders if efficacy and tolerability are confirmed with additional studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,N,,,,,,0,Calibration1,N,,,,,,0
M7,10.1111/nuf.12007,Military Resilience: A Concept Analysis,"Since the events surrounding September 11, 2011, and natural disasters, research on resilience has shifted from children to adult resilience. The military began to embrace the concept in 2008 in an effort to decrease the number of military service member (SM) suicides.The purpose of this article is to explain resilience as it relates to military SMs using the process for concept analysis outlined by Walker and Avant (2005).Adaptive coping, personal control, hardiness, and social support are the attributes that characterize psychological resilience in SMs. Antecedents for resilience are life events such as serious accidents, prior deployments where death is witnessed, and combat involvement. Consequences of high resilience include decreased mental health symptoms and career and personal success, while consequences of low resilience include increased mental health symptoms and participating in high-risk behaviors.Understanding resilience as it relates to SMs is critical. Nurses must be able to assess SMs and be equipped to refer them or their family members to the most appropriate care. As more is learned about resilience in the military community, there may be broader implications to the civilian community. Improved understanding of psychological resilience may lead to improved interventions appropriate for both civilians and military SMs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M8,,Looking like the enemy: An interpretative phenomenological analysis of how race-related stressors in the military contribute to post traumatic stress disorder in Asian American and Pacific Islander Vietnam veterans,"Although significant evidence exists in the current literature about both the impact of race-related stressors on racial minority groups as well as the psychological impact of military-related stressors, there is very little research demonstrating the complexities of what a soldier may experience when a war is fought in a country where she/he resembles the enemy. This study explores how race-related stressors experienced in the military by Vietnam War veterans of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ancestry contributed to the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other trauma-related psychiatric disorders. This topic has been explored by researchers out of the VA Pacific Islands Health Care System, National Center for PTSD in 1994 and their findings suggest that race-related stressors is a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms for Vietnam veterans of AAPI ancestry. Almost two decades since that study was conducted, this dissertation will examine, through the use of focus groups, if certain phenomenological themes have remained constant over time and also if new ones emerge. The generated hypothesis is that there will be phenomenological themes that abide over time related to the extended biopsychosocial effects of race-related stressors, particularly in the context of war. The second hypothesis posits that new themes will also surface as a result of the different political, social, and cultural climate these veterans currently reside in nearly two decades later. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are also explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to further the dissemination of these new methods, the authors present a pedagogical introduction to the structural equation modeling based latent trajectory model, or LTM. They review several different types of LTMs, discuss matching an optimal LTM to a given question of interest, and highlight several issues that might be particularly salient for research in psychopathology.

M11,10.1016/j.janxdis.2015.06.002,Anxiety sensitivity and post-traumatic stress reactions: Evidence for intrusions and physiological arousal as mediating and moderating mechanisms,"A growing body of research has implicated anxiety sensitivity (AS) and its dimensions in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the mechanism(s) that may account for the association between AS and PTSD remains unclear. Using the ""trauma film paradigm,"" which provides a prospective experimental tool for investigating analog intrusion development, the present study examines the extent to which intrusions mediate the association between AS and the development of posttraumatic stress reactions. After completing a measure of AS and state mood, unselected participants (n = 45) viewed a 10 min film of graphic scenes of fatal traffic accidents and then completed a second assessment of state mood. Participants then kept a daily diary to record intrusions about the film for a one-week period. Post-traumatic stress reactions about the film were then assessed after the one-week period. The results showed that general AS and physical and cognitive concerns AS predicted greater post-traumatic stress reactions about the film a week later. Furthermore, the number of intrusions the day after viewing the traumatic film, but not fear and disgust in response to the trauma film, mediated the association between general AS (and AS specifically for physical and cognitive concerns) and post-traumatic stress reactions a week later. Subsequent analysis also showed that physiological arousal during initial exposure to the traumatic film moderated the association between general AS and the number of intrusions reported the day after viewing the film. The implications of these analog findings for conceptualizing the mechanism(s) that may interact to explain the role of AS in the development of PTSD and its effective treatment are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M12,10.1177/0093854814556882,Trajectories of Exposure to Community Violence and Mental Health Symptoms Among Serious Adolescent Offenders,"The present study uses longitudinal data to investigate whether differences in exposure to community violence discriminate among serious juvenile offenders in terms of mental health symptomatology for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and hostility. Group-based modeling and moderation analyses are used to assess the influence of exposure to violence on mental health outcomes. The results demonstrate a moderating effect of psychosocial maturity and social support between exposure to community violence and adverse mental health consequences for youth on the stable low exposure trajectory. In addition, youth who experience stable high exposure to violence consistently suffer worse outcomes. The study contributes to the development of empirically derived profiles of serious youth offenders. While all of the youth in this study may face the stigma of being labeled as dangerous, some (particularly those on the chronic exposure trajectory) might find themselves in a situation where their psychological status exacerbates an already tenuous situation: reentry. Therefore, reentry services should better target the specific needs of this returning subgroup of serious youth offenders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M13,10.1186/s40621-014-0016-1,A spatial analysis of functional outcomes and quality of life outcomes after pediatric injury,"BackgroundChanges in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are more regularly being monitored during the first year after injury. Monitoring changes in HRQoL using spatial cluster analysis can potentially identify concentrations of geographic areas with injury survivors with similar outcomes, thereby improving how interventions are delivered or in how outcomes are evaluated.MethodsWe used a spatial scan statistic designed for oridinal data to test two different spatial cluster analysis of very low, low, high, and very high HRQoL scores. Our study was based on HRQoL scores returned by children treated for injury at British Columbia Children’s Hospital and discharged to the Vancouver Metropolitan Area. Spatial clusters were assessed at 4 time periods – baseline (based on pre-injury health as reported prior to discharge from hospital), and one, four, and twelve months after discharge. Outcome data were measured used the PedsQL™ outcome scale. Outcome values of very low, low, high, and very high HRQoL scores were defined by classifying PedsQL™ scores into quartiles. In the first test, all scores were assessed for clustering without specifying whether the response score was from a baseline or follow-up response. In the second analysis, we built a space-time model to identify whether HRQoL responses could be identified at specific time points.ResultsAmong all participants, geographic clustering of response scores were observed globally and at specific time periods. In the purely spatial analysis, five significant clusters of ‘very low’ PedsQL physical and psychosocial health outcomes were identified within geographic zones ranging in size from 1 to 21 km. A space-time analysis of outcomes identified significant clusters of both ‘very low’ and ‘low’ outcomes between survey months within zones ranging in size from 3 to 5 km.ConclusionMonitoring patient health outcomes following injury is important for planning and targeting interventions. A common theme in the literature is that future prevention efforts may benefit from identifying those most a risk of developing ongoing problems after injury in effort to target resources to those most in need. Spatial scan statistics are tools that could be applied for identifying concentrations of poor recovery outcomes. By classifying outcomes as a categorical variable, clusters of ‘potentially low’ outcomes can also be mapped, thereby identifying populations whose recovery status may decrease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the frequency and predictors of sPTSD and fdPTSD 1–6months after a nondisabling ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). <h3>Methods</h3> Consecutive patients were assessed for sPTSD (Impact of Events Scale-Revised, IES-R, significant if >30) and fdPTSD (PTSD-Interview). We recorded sociodemographic factors, stroke features (including severity of the initial deficit, persistent disability, localization), associated mood changes, peritraumatic reactions during the stroke (Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI) for fear and distress, Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire for cognitive appraisal), and psychiatric history. Patients with sPTSD and fdPTSD were compared to patients with IES-R<30. <h3>Results</h3> Among the 40 patients (65% male, mean age 52years) studied post-IS (n=30; mean initial NIHSS 4) or TIA, 25% had sPTSD, including 10% with fdPTSD. sPTSD was more frequent in women (<i>p</i>=0.02), patients with intense peritraumatic reactions especially on PDI (<i>p</i>=0.001) or identified prior depression and anxiety (<i>p</i>=0.007). No other demographic factors or stroke characteristics were associated with sPTSD. Forty percent of sPTSD patients were depressed versus none of the controls (<i>p</i><0.002). All fdPTSD patients had ≥3 prior psychiatric co-morbidities. <h3>Conclusions</h3> After nondisabling IS or TIA, sPTSD is frequent, with fdPTSD for 10%. Patients with intense peritraumatic reactions, women, and those with prior psychiatric morbidity, require particular attention to detect sPTSD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M17,10.1503/cmaj.131792,Child abuse and mental disorders in Canada,"Nationally representative Canadian data on the prevalence of child abuse and its relation with mental disorders are lacking. We used contemporary, nationally representative data to examine the prevalence of 3 types of child abuse (physical abuse, sexual abuse and exposure to intimate partner violence) and their association with 14 mental conditions, including suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.We obtained data from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health, collected from the 10 provinces. Respondents aged 18 years and older were asked about child abuse and were selected for the study sample (n = 23,395). The survey had a multistage stratified cluster design (household response rate 79.8%).The prevalence of any child abuse was 32% (individual types ranged from 8% to 26%). All types of child abuse were associated with all mental conditions, including suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, after adjustment for sociodemographic variables (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.4 to 7.9). We found a dose-response relation, with increasing number of abuse types experienced corresponding with greater odds of mental conditions. Associations between child abuse and attention deficit disorder, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts showed stronger effects for women than men.We found robust associations between child abuse and mental conditions. Health care providers, especially those assessing patients with mental health problems, need to be aware of the relation between specific types of child abuse and certain mental conditions. Success in preventing child abuse could lead to reductions in the prevalence of mental disorders, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During World War I, soldiers in the trenches, undergoing unrelenting artillery bombardment, suffered from similar symptoms, designated at the time as ""shell shock."" Dr Frederick Mott proposed studying the brains of deceased soldiers to elucidate the neuropathology of this clinical entity. Subsequent to a British government enquiry after World War I, the term ""shell shock"" was banned and further investigation into a possible organic cause for these symptoms was discontinued. Nevertheless, similar clinical entities, such as combat or battle fatigue and posttraumatic stress disorder, continue to be encountered by combatants in subsequent military conflicts. To this day, there exists a paucity of neuropathology studies investigating the effects of high explosives on the human brain.

M19,10.1191/1740774506cn133oa,Consumer involvement in consent document development: a multicenter cluster randomized trial to assess study participants' understanding,"Despite widespread agreement on the importance of informed consent in clinical research, uncertainty remains about the adequacy of current consent procedures and documentation.The objective of the study was to compare an informed consent document developed by a consumer group of potential study participants to one developed by the study investigators. The study was a cluster randomized, controlled study embedded in a 'parent' randomized controlled trial of 1092 participants with Gulf War veterans' illnesses recruited in 1999-2000 at 20 US medical centers. Centers were randomized to the investigator-developed or participant-developed consent document. The primary outcome measure was an Informed Consent Questionnaire-4 (ICQ-4), a validated four-item scale measuring self-reported participant understanding scored from 0 to 1. Secondary outcomes included the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 and measures of study refusal and adherence to the parent trial protocol.There were no significant differences between consent documents on the ICQ-4 score overall or at any of the time points. Mean (95% CI) treatment differences ranged from +0.020 (-0.015, 0.055) (better understanding) at entry to -0.021 (-0.054, 0.012) (worse understanding) at three-months for the participant versus the investigator document group. There were also no significant differences in satisfaction, adherence to the protocol, or in the proportion of patients who refused to participate in the trial.The consumer group may not have been representative of the study participants and they did not suggest dramatic changes to the consent document. The outcome assessment questionnaire was not validated prior to the trial's initiation.Consumer modification of the consent document did not lead to either benefit or harm in understanding, satisfaction, or study refusal and adherence rates. This study did demonstrate, however, that embedding consent studies in a clinical trial is feasible and can address important questions about informed consent without disrupting the primary study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is unknown if clusters of commonly co-occurring stressors are identifiable. The study was designed to explore family-level stressor clustering in the general population, to estimate the prevalence of exposure classes, and to examine the correlation of sociodemographic characteristics with class prevalence. Method: Data were collected from an epidemiological sample and analyzed using latent class regression. Results: A six-class solution was identified. Classes were characterized by low risk (prevalence = 23%), universal high risk (7 %), family conflict (11 %), household substance problems (22 %), non-nuclear family structure (24 %), parent's mental illness (13 %). Conclusions: Class prevalence varied with race and welfare status, not gender. Interventions for childhood stressors are person-focused; the analytic approach may uniquely inform resource allocation. © Steinkopff Verlag 2004.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
