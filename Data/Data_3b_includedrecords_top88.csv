Furthermore, it examined whether the tendency to dissociate, pre-deployment personality factors, conceptualized by the Big Five model, and previous trauma represented independent risk factors for post-deployment PTSD symptoms. Method: This prospective study included the entire team of 743 soldiers from the Danish Contingent of the International Security Assistance Force 7 deployed to Afghanistan in 2009. Data consisted of self-report measures and were collected six times: before deployment; during deployment; and 1-3 weeks, 2 months, 7 months and 2.5 years after homecoming. Results: The findings indicate significant associations between pre-deployment dissociation and six PTSD trajectories (p < 0.001, η2 = 0.120). Based on mean differences in dissociation for the six trajectories, two main groups emerged: a group with high dissociation scores at pre-deployment, which had moderate PTSD symptom levels at pre-deployment and fluctuated over time; and a group with low dissociation scores at pre-deployment, which had low initial PTSD symptom levels and diverged over time. Our study also confirmed previous findings of a positive association between neuroticism and dissociation (r = 0.31, p < 0.001). This suggests that negative emotionality may be a vulnerability that enhances dissociative experiences, although a causal link cannot be concluded from the findings. Finally, pre-deployment dissociation, pre-deployment neuroticism and a history of traumatic events, as independent factors, were significant predictors of post-deployment PTSD (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.158). Conclusions: The study emphasizes the multiplicity of factors involved in the development of PTSD, and group differences in dissociative symptoms support the heterogeneity in PTSD. Further, this study points to specific aspects of personality that may be targeted in a clinical setting and in pre-deployment assessments in the military.Objetivo: En este estudio investigamos si la disociación previa a un despliegue militar estaba asociada con trayectorias de síntomas de TEPT previamente identificadas desde antes hasta 2,5 años después del despliegue militar. Además, examinamos si la tendencia a disociarse, los factores de personalidad previos al despliegue, conceptualizados por el modelo Big Five y el trauma previo, representaban factores de riesgo independientes para los síntomas de TEPT posteriores al despliegue.Método: El estudio prospectivo actual incluyó a todo el equipo de 743 soldados del contingente danés de la Fuerza de Asistencia Internacional a la Seguridad Internacional 7 desplegados en Afganistán en 2009. Los datos consistieron en medidas de autoinforme, y se recogieron 6 veces: antes del despliegue, durante el despliegue. 1–3 semanas después del regreso al hogar, 2 meses después del regreso al hogar, 7 meses después del regreso al hogar y 2.5 años después del regreso al hogar.Resultados: Los hallazgos indican asociaciones significativas entre la disociación previa al despliegue y seis trayectorias de TEPT (p < 0.001, η2 = 0.120), y en base a diferencias medias en la disociación para las seis trayectorias surgieron dos grupos principales: Un grupo con puntuaciones de disociación altas previas al despliegue, que tenían niveles moderados de síntomas de TEPT antes del despliegue y fluctuaban con el tiempo. Un segundo grupo con puntuaciones de disociación bajas previas al despliegue, que tenían bajos niveles iniciales de síntomas de TEPT y divergían con el tiempo. Además, nuestro estudio confirmó los hallazgos previos sobre una asociación positiva entre el neuroticismo y la disociación (r = 0.31, p < 0.001). Esto podría sugerir que la emocionalidad negativa puede ser una vulnerabilidad que aumenta las experiencias disociativas, aunque no se puede concluir un vínculo causal a partir de los hallazgos. Finalmente, la disociación previa al despliegue, el neuroticismo previo al despliegue y una historia de eventos traumáticos, como factores independientes, fueron predictores significativos de TEPT posterior al despliegue (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.158).Conclusiones: El estudio enfatiza la multiplicidad de factores involucrados en el desarrollo del TEPT y las diferencias grupales en los síntomas disociativos apoyan la heterogeneidad en el TEPT. Además, este estudio apunta a aspectos específicos de la personalidad en los que se puede trabajarse en un entorno clínico, así como en las evaluaciones previas al despliegue en el ejército.目标：在本研究中我们考察了入伍前的分离症状是否和从入伍前到入伍2.5年后的PTSD 症状轨迹相关联。进一步，我们考察了这种分离倾向性、入伍前的人格因子（大五模型）和前期创伤是否代表了不同的入伍后 PTSD风险因子。方法： 本前瞻研究包括2009年阿富汗国际维和部队丹麦分遣队的全部743名士兵，数据包括在6个时间点收集的自评测量：入伍前、服役中，复员1-3周后、2个月、7个月和2.5年后。结果：研究的发现指出入伍前分离和六个 PTSD 轨迹的显著关联 (p < 0.001, η2 = 0.120)，根据六个轨迹的分离症状平均数差异，出现了两个主要分组：一个组入伍前高分离，同时有中等的 PTSD 症状，并随着时间波动；第二个组在入伍前低分离，并有较低的 PTSD 症状水平但随着时间出现分支。另外，我们的研究验证了前人发现，说明神经质和分离之间的正相关 (r = 0.31, p < 0.001)。这可能提示负面情绪可能是增加分离体验的易感因素，尽管还不能从这些发现出总结出因果链。最后，作为独立因素的入伍前分离、入伍前神经质和创伤事件历史，都是服役后 PTSD 的显著预测指标。结论：本研究强调了在 PTSD 发展中多种因子，还有分离症状支持 PTSD 的异质性的组间差异。本研究更进一步指出在临床设置和军队入伍前评估中可能需要关注一些独特的人格特质。.",0

The sample consists of approximately 40% Jews born in Israel (n = 652), 30% (n = 484) were Jews who immigrated to Israel, and close to 30% (n = 477) were Palestinian Citizens of Israel. Mediation analyses explored the role of resource loss in the relationship between social status and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity.Results Compared to native born Jews, foreign born Jews and Palestinian Citizens of Israel reported greater PTSD symptom severity at wave III. These relationships were not mediated by psychosocial resource loss or economic resource loss.Conclusions We discuss the importance of tailored interventions with minority groups in the context of ongoing political violence.",0

However, most studies focus on symptoms of psychiatric disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, depression), which are limited by heterogeneity and symptom overlap. We examined trajectories of cross-cutting posttraumatic symptom dimensions following traumatic injury and predictors of trajectory membership.In this longitudinal study of 427 predominantly Hispanic/Latino traumatic injury survivors, posttraumatic psychopathology symptoms were assessed during hospitalization and approximately one and five months post-trauma. Using latent class growth analysis, we estimated trajectories of several posttraumatic symptom dimensions: re-experiencing, avoidance, anxious arousal, numbing, dysphoric arousal, loss, and threat. We then examined sociodemographic and trauma-related characteristics (measured during hospitalization) as predictors of trajectory membership for each dimension.Four trajectories (Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset, Recovery) emerged for all dimensions except loss and threat, which manifested three trajectories (Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset). Across dimensions, membership in the Chronic (vs. Resilient) trajectory was consistently predicted by unemployment (7 of 7 dimensions), followed by older age (3/7), female sex (3/7), and assaultive trauma (2/7). For several dimensions, unemployment also distinguished between participants who presented with similar symptom levels days after trauma, but then diverged over time.Measures of posttraumatic symptom dimension constructs differed across assessments.This study provides evidence of distinct trajectories across transdiagnostic symptom dimensions after traumatic injury. Employment status emerged as the most important predictor of trajectory membership. Research is needed to better understand the etiologies and consequences of these posttraumatic symptom dimension trajectories.",0

There were 55.8% who were resistant to depression symptoms across the 4 years of study, and 41.5% who were resistant to PTS symptoms. There were 18.7% and 42.2% of participants who showed resilience (experiencing slightly elevated symptoms followed by a decline, according to Bonanno et al., 2002) to depression and PTS symptoms, respectively. Mild and chronic dysfunction constituted the smallest trajectory groups across disorders. Marital status, deployment to an area of conflict, and number of lifetime stressors were associated with membership into different latent groups for depression (unstandardized β estimates range = 0.69 to 1.37). Deployment to an area of conflict, number of lifetime traumatic events and education predicted membership into different latent groups for PTS (significant unstandardized β estimate range = 0.83 to 3.17). AUD was associated with an increase in both symptom outcomes (significant unstandardized β estimate range = 0.20 to 9.45). These results suggested that alcohol use disorder may have contributed substantially to trajectories of psychopathology in this population.",0

EARLY TRAJECTORIES OF POSITIVE SYMPTOMS REMISSION IN FIRST EPISODE-PSYCHOSIS: A 2-YEAR FOLLOW-UP STUDY,"Abstract Background The Prevention and Early intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP) provides young people with first episode psychosis (FEP) rapid access to appropriate mental health services designed on the principles of early intervention (EI). We have previously demonstrated high rates of positive symptom (PS) remission. However, the relationship between PS, negative symptoms (NS) and functional outcomes remains unclear. Adherence to medication and early treatment response have been shown to be important independent determinants of the level of, and time to, symptom and functional remission, respectively. While trajectories of symptom severity have been shown to be heterogeneous, no previous study has investigated the prognosis of PS remission among individuals with FEP treated in an EI service. Identification of different trajectories of PS remission is a useful strategy to provide insight into clinically meaningful subgroups of patients while providing valuable information on NS and functioning for improving treatment outcomes. Methods The 2-year treatment at PEPP comprises different psychosocial (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy, group intervention, family intervention, individual placement and support program) and psychopharmacological interventions (i.e., minimum effective dosage of second-generation antipsychotics). Monthly assessments were conducted from baseline to month 24. A total of 387 FEP patients, aged 14–35 years, with DSM IV affective or non-affective psychosis and little or no prior antipsychotic treatment (i.e., &amp;lt; 30 days) were included. PS remission was defined as absence of overt psychotic symptoms (i.e., all global SAPS items ≤ 2). A Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) was used to investigate the distinct trajectories based on cumulative length of PS remission assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of treatment. Predictors of trajectories were investigated among sociodemographic, pre-treatment, as well as baseline and course clinical characteristics. Chi-square tests, one-way and mixed ANOVAs identified which baseline and longitudinal variables differed between and within trajectories. Candidate predictors that were statistically significant were then entered into a multinomial regression model to determine which factors independently predict trajectory membership. Results Three distinct trajectories of PS remission were identified. Excellent (68%), unstable (15%) and poor (17%) trajectory. Trajectories differed at baseline in DUP, diagnosis of affective psychosis and PS severity. Over the 24 months of treatment, negative, depressive, anxiety and mania symptoms, as well as functioning, best improved in the excellent trajectory among which patients were prescribed less antipsychotics in term of chlorpromazine equivalent than patients in other trajectories. Multinomial regression of baseline characteristics revealed that absence of early treatment response at 3 months (adjusted OR=2.53; 95%CI=1.24–5.16) independently predicted poorer trajectory. Discussion These results highlight the heterogeneous prognosis of PS remission suggesting that the diversity in FEP response and phenotypes may be determined by different pathophysiological underpinnings. The fact that early response was found to be a strong predictor of PS remission supports early and adequate symptom control for which medication is a critical issue. Further research applying data-driven trajectory analysis in FEP is warranted to facilitate better characterization of longer-term patterns of remission and development of targeted intervention to promote early recovery.",0

https://openalex.org/W2068353782,10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.11.032,Mental health and general wellness in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike,"Exposure to natural disasters has been linked to a range of adverse outcomes, including mental health problems (e.g., posttraumatic stress symptoms [PTSS], depression), declines in role functioning (e.g., occupational difficulties), and physical health problems (e.g., somatic complaints). However, prior research and theory suggest that the modal postdisaster response in each of these domains is resilience, defined as low levels of symptoms or problems in a given outcome over time, with minimal elevations that are limited to the time period during the disaster and its immediate aftermath. However, the extent to which disaster survivors exhibit mental health wellness (resilience across multiple mental health conditions) or general wellness (resilience across mental health, physical health, and role functioning domains) remains unexplored. The purpose of this study was to quantify mental health and general wellness, and to examine predictors of each form of wellness, in a three-wave population-based study of Hurricane Ike survivors (N = 658). Latent class growth analysis was used to determine the frequency of resilience on four outcomes (PTSS: 74.9%; depression: 57.9%; functional impairment: 45.1%; days of poor health: 52.6%), and cross-tabulations were used to determine the frequency of mental health wellness (51.2%) and general wellness (26.1%). Significant predictors of both mental health and general wellness included lower peri-event emotional reactions and higher community-level collective efficacy; loss of sentimental possessions or pets and disaster-related financial loss were negative predictors of mental health wellness, and loss of personal property was a negative predictor of general wellness. The results suggest that studies focusing on a single postdisaster outcome may have overestimated the prevalence of mental health and general wellness, and that peri-event responses, personal property loss and collective efficacy have a cross-cutting influence across multiple domains of postdisaster functioning.",0

A total of 4487 rescue and recovery workers (1874 police and 2613 non-traditional responders) involved during and in the aftermath of the unprecedented World Trade Center (WTC) attacks, were assessed an average of 3, 6, 8, and 12 years post-9/11/2001. Among police responders, WTC-related PTSD symptoms were characterized by four trajectories, including no/low-symptom (76.1%), worsening (12.1%), improving (7.5%), and chronic (4.4%) trajectories. In non-traditional responders, a five-trajectory solution was optimal, with fewer responders in a no/low-symptom trajectory (55.5%), and the remainder in subtly worsening (19.3%), chronic (10.8%), improving (8.5%), and steeply worsening (5.9%) trajectories. Consistent factors associated with symptomatic PTSD trajectories across responder groups included Hispanic ethnicity, pre-9/11 psychiatric history, greater WTC exposure, greater medical illness burden, life stressors and post-9/11 traumas, and maladaptive coping (e.g., substance use, avoidance coping). Higher perceived preparedness, greater sense of purpose in life, and positive emotion-focused coping (e.g., positive reframing, acceptance) were negatively associated with symptomatic trajectories. Findings in this unique cohort indicate considerable heterogeneity in WTC-related PTSD symptom trajectories over 12 years post-9/11/2001, with lower rates of elevated PTSD symptoms in police than in non-traditional responders. They further provide a comprehensive risk prediction model of PTSD symptom trajectories, which can inform prevention, monitoring, and treatment efforts in WTC and other disaster responders.",0

Earlier studies have identified specific mental health trajectories both in children and adults. This study aimed, first, to identify potential PTSS-related trajectories by using latent class growth analyses among children in a three-wave assessment after the 2008/2009 War on Gaza, Palestine. Second, it analyzed how family- and child related factors (e.g., attachment relations, posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs), guilt, and emotion regulation) associate with the trajectory class membership. The sample consisted of 240 Palestinian children (49.4% girls and 50.6% boys) of 10–13 years of age (M=11.29, SD=0.68), who completed PTSS (CRIES) assessments at 3 (T1), 5 (T2), and 11 (T3) months after the war. Children reported their personal exposure to war trauma, attachment style, cognitive trauma processing, and emotion regulation, and their parents reported family war trauma exposure and attachment style. Results revealed a three-trajectory solution, a majority of children belonging to the Recovery trajectory (n=183), and a minority belonged either to Resistant trajectory (n=29) or to Increasing symptoms trajectory (n=28). Low levels of negative posttraumatic cognitive appraisals, feelings of guilt and emotion regulation were characteristic of children in the Resistant trajectory as compared to Increasing symptoms trajectory. Father׳s attachment security was further associated with the Resistant trajectory membership. Children׳s attachment avoidance and high parental trauma were typical to children in Recovery trajectory (as compared to the Increasing symptoms trajectory).",0

Both parents reported their exposure to war trauma, secure attachment availability, and parenting practices, as well as the target child’s internalizing and externalizing symptoms [Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)]. Children reported their symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (on the Children’s Revised Impact Event Scale), depression (Birleson), and SDQ, as well as their post-traumatic cognitions (Children’s Post Traumatic Cognitions Inventory).Results: A cluster analysis identified four family types. The largest type reflected secure attachment and optimal relationships (security and positive family relationships, 36.2%, n = 102), and the smallest exhibited insecurity and problematic relationships (insecurity and negative family relationships, 15.6%; n = 44). Further, families with discrepant experiences (23.0%; n = 65) and moderate security and neutral relationships (25.2%; n = 71) emerged. The insecurity and negative relationships family type showed higher levels of war trauma; internalizing, externalizing, and depressive symptoms among children; and dysfunctional post-traumatic cognitions than other family types.Conclusion: The family systems approach to mental health is warranted in war conditions, and therapeutic interventions for children should, thus, also involve parents and siblings. Knowledge of unique family attachment patterns is fruitful for tailoring therapeutic treatments and preventive interventions for war-affected children and families.",1

Much literature has documented the importance of a positive outlook in pursuing investments in health and education that pay off in the future. A question that has received less attention is whether a positive outlook creates resilience in the face of setbacks or whether a positive outlook may be a disadvantage in extreme circumstances, especially when there is a large mismatch between expectations and reality. This paper uses the coincidental interview schedule of the Add Health data (N = 15,024) around the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 to examine interactions with this environmental shock and previously elicited measures of hopefulness. The results suggest that increases in depressive symptoms following the attack are concentrated among those young adults who initially expressed the most hopefulness in the future as teenagers.",1

Research suggests, however, that some people who experience trauma, including veterans, report posttraumatic growth (PTG), or positive personal changes following adversity. In this study, we tested a comprehensive model of PTG, PTSD, and satisfaction with life in a veteran population, exploring the roles of challenges to core beliefs, types of rumination, sex, and time since event. Method: Data were collected via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing website, from veterans (N = 197) who had experienced a stressful event within the last 3 years (M = 16.66 months, SD = 12.27 months). Structural equation modeling was used to test an integrated conceptual model of PTG, PTSD, and satisfaction with life. Results: Results showed that challenge to core beliefs was directly associated with both deliberate and intrusive rumination. Deliberate rumination was positively related to PTG; intrusive rumination was positively related to symptoms of PTSD. PTG and PTSD, in turn, mediated the relationship between rumination styles and satisfaction with life; PTG was related to higher satisfaction with life; and PTSD was negatively related to satisfaction with life. Results failed to show differences on any model variables as a function of time since event or sex. Conclusion: Results indicate that the intentional facilitation of PTG may be a complementary and alternative option to the reduction of PTSD symptoms for improving satisfaction with life. Findings suggest that efforts to facilitate PTG should be focused on strategies for promoting deliberate rumination.",1

The objective of this study was to determine the longitudinal patterns of these typologies, especially the movement of persons across clusters of psychopathology.In this 6-year longitudinal study, 1,167 hospitalized severe injury patients who were recruited between April 2004-February 2006 were analyzed, with repeated measures at baseline, 3 months, 12 months, and 72 months after injury. All patients met the DSM-IV criterion A1 for PTSD. Structured clinical interviews were used to assess psychiatric disorders at each follow-up point. Latent class analysis and latent transition analysis were applied to assess clusters of individuals determined by psychopathology. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) were employed to complete diagnoses.Four latent classes were identified at each time point: (1) Alcohol/Depression class (3 months, 2.1%; 12 months, 1.3%; and 72 months, 1.1%), (2) Alcohol class (3 months, 3.3%; 12 months, 3.7%; and 72 months, 5.4%), (3) PTSD/Depression class (3 months, 10.3%; 12 months, 11.5%; and 72 months, 6.4%), and (4) No Disorder class (3 months, 84.2%; 12 months, 83.5%; and 72 months, 87.1%). Latent transition analyses conducted across the 2 transition points (12 months and 72 months) found consistently high levels of stability in the No Disorder class (90.9%, 93.0%, respectively) but lower and reducing levels of consistency in the PTSD/Depression class (81.3%, 46.6%), the Alcohol/Depression class (59.7%, 21.5%), and the Alcohol class (61.0%, 36.5%), demonstrating high levels of between-class migration.Despite the array of psychiatric disorders that may develop following severe injury, a 4-class model best described the data with excellent classification certainty. The high levels of migration across classes indicate a complex pattern of psychopathology expression over time. The findings have considerable implications for tailoring multifocused interventions to class type, as well as flexible stepped care models, and for the potential development and delivery of transdiagnostic interventions targeting underlying mechanisms.",1

These effects may be intensified for victims of interpersonal traumas given that these events are often associated with heightened risk for adverse outcomes. To better understand this relationship, the present study prospectively examined the effect of pre-shooting trauma exposure (i.e., interpersonal vs. non-interpersonal trauma) on psychological functioning (i.e., posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression) following a mass campus shooting. Based on previous research, it was expected that negative appraisals and social support would mediate this relationship. A sample of 515 college women reporting prior trauma exposure was assessed at four time points following the shooting (i.e., pre-shooting, 1-month, 6-months, and 12-months post-shooting). Bootstrap analyses with bias-corrected confidence intervals were conducted. Contrary to expectation, pre-shooting trauma exposure was unrelated to 12-month post-shooting outcomes and neither negative appraisals nor social support at 6-months post-shooting emerged as mediators. Interestingly, a history of non-interpersonal trauma was associated with greater post-shooting family and friend support than a history of interpersonal trauma. Ad hoc analyses showed that pre-shooting symptom severity and level of exposure to the shooting had indirect effects on post-shooting outcomes via post-shooting negative appraisals. These findings support that cumulative trauma, regardless of type, may not have an additive effect unless individuals develop clinically significant symptoms following previous trauma. Trauma severity also appears to play a meaningful role.",1

National Guard service members ( N = 311) completed surveys assessing demographics, beliefs about mental health treatment, emotion regulation strategies, and psychiatric symptoms. Mental health treatment utilization was assessed at the 6-months follow-up. Postdeployment, 41.2% of the sample had psychiatric symptoms above the clinical cut-off for at least one symptom measure. This proportion increased at follow-up (53.5%). Alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms showed the largest increase ( d = 0.66), although symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) also showed small magnitude increases. Among those with elevated symptoms postdeployment ( n = 128), only 27.8% received mental health treatment at follow-up. Severity of depression, anxiety, and PTSD were higher among those who utilized treatment. The postdeployment period is a vulnerable one.

Competing theories of dissociation pose controversy regarding dissociation as a taxon versus a continuum, and results of the current study contribute to this debate by providing evidence of distinct group differences between those high and low in dissociation. Mixture modeling revealed 2 groups of youth with differing levels of depersonalization/derealization dissociative symptoms. Differences between the 2 groups of youth were investigated regarding trauma exposure and several posttraumatic reactions: posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), emotion dysregulation, and emotional numbing. Compared with youth classified in the low-dissociation group, youth who exhibited high levels of dissociation demonstrated higher levels of total PTSS, posttraumatic symptom clusters of emotional numbing, intrusion, and associated features, as well as reporting more difficulties with emotion dysregulation. To test theory regarding the factors that increase the likelihood of persistent dissociation, bootstrapped regression analyses were performed to examine the possibility of an indirect effect of peritraumatic dissociation. Results consistent with statistical mediation suggested that the presence of peritraumatic dissociation at the time of trauma may contribute to the continuation of dissociative symptoms as a more generalized pattern. The results of the current study have implications for clinical treatment with traumatized youth.",2

After a pilot study (N=10), which indicated feasible and deliverable study procedures and interventions, we subsequently launched an RCT with a target sample size of 352 participants randomized to either three sessions PE or non-directive support. Due to an unforeseen major reorganization at the hospital, the RCT was discontinued after 32 included participants. Results In this paper, we highlight obstacles and lessons learned from our feasibility work, relevant for preventive psychological interventions for PTSD in emergency settings. One important finding was the high degree of attrition: only 78% and 34% respectively came back for the two months and six-months assessments. There were also difficulties in reaching eligible patients immediately after the event. Based on our experiences, we envisage that alternative models of implementation might overcome these obstacles, for example, with remote delivery of both assessments and treatment, combined with multiple recruitment procedures. Lessons learned from this terminated RCT are discussed in depth.",2

Second, it analyses the role of family factors (maternal attachment and family atmosphere) as moderating the intervention impacts on resilience. School classes in Gaza were randomized into intervention (N=242) and control (N=240) groups. The percentage of girls (49.4%) and boys (50.6%) were equal, and the child age was 10-13 years in both groups. Children reported positive indicators of their mental health (prosocial behaviour and psychosocial well-being) at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2) and at a six-month follow-up (T3). At T1 they accounted their exposure to war trauma. Mothers reported about their willingness to serve as an attachment figure, and the child reported about the family atmosphere. Resilience was conceptualized as a presence of positive indications of mental health despite trauma exposure. Against our hypothesis, the intervention did not increase the level of resilience statistically significantly, nor was the effect of the intervention moderated by maternal attachment responses or family atmosphere.",2

We used Latent Class Growth Mixture Modeling (LCGMM) to identify subgroups of bereaved individuals sharing similar trajectories for each disorder. We used repeated measures ANOVA to evaluate differences in individual symptoms between trajectories. Finally, we investigated to what extent chronic trajectories of these three disorders co-occurred.Three trajectories of PG symptoms emerged: resilient (66.4%), chronic (25.1%) and acute recovery (8.4%). The overall severity and symptom profile of the acute recovery group were indistinguishable from that of the chronic group through 6 months post-bereavement, followed by reduction in PG from 6 to 18 months post-bereavement. Chronic PTS in the first-year post-bereavement tended to co-occur with chronic PG and/or chronic depression.Twenty five percent of those with initial elevations in grief recovered in the period of 6 to 12 months post-bereavement. These findings highlight the clinical importance of severe grief in the initial months following loss, but also suggests caution in diagnosing a grief disorder within the first-year post-bereavement.",2

Understanding the long-term development of depressive symptoms after deployment is important to improve decision-making regarding deployment and mental health policies in the military. Therefore, this study aims to investigate trajectories of depressive symptoms from pre- to post-deployment and assess the role of specific factors, such as demographics, early life trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and deployment stressors, in the Dutch army. Methods The study includes a cohort of 1032 military men and women deployed to Afghanistan between 2005 and 2008. From pre-to 10 years post-deployment (across 6 distinct time points), depressive and PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Symptom CheckList-90 (SCL-90) and the Self-Rating Inventory for PTSD (SRIP) respectively. Demographics, early trauma, and deployment experiences were collected at baseline and after deployment, respectively. Latent Class Growth Analysis was used to explore heterogeneity in developmental trajectories of depressive symptoms over time. Results The study identified four trajectories for depressive symptoms: resilient (65%), intermediate-stable (20%), symptomatic-chronic (9%), and late-onset-increasing (6%). The late-onset-increasing group had the highest proportion of individuals younger than 21 years. In addition, the resilient group was less likely to have experienced deployment stressors and the symptomatic-chronic group reported more early life traumas compared to the other groups. For individuals classified in trajectories with higher levels of depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms were higher at all time points. Conclusions Multiple trajectories for depressive symptoms were identified in a military sample up to 10 years after deployment. These trajectories were associated with age, early trauma, deployment stressors and PTSD symptoms. The majority of the sample fell within the resilient trajectory, supporting the notion that deployed military personnel possess a high level of resilience. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights and a foundation for further research in this area.",2

Part of a larger project exploring experiences following emotionally distressing events among military veterans (N = 197) using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (Mturk), in the current study, we sought to clarify associations between the time since event and PTG. We used cluster-analytic techniques and analyses of variance to (a) determine the number of clusters, and (b) assess differences in core constructs of PTG and participant characteristics across clusters. Results revealed 4 significantly different groups (i.e., clusters) characterized by differential associations between PTG and time since event. These groups also differed significantly in challenge to core beliefs, level of PTSD symptoms, intrusive and deliberate rumination, and age. The immediate moderate-growth group (Cluster 1) experienced moderate levels of PTG over shorter periods of time, severe PTSD symptoms, and was significantly younger. The low-growth group (Cluster 2) was characterized by minimal PTG, regardless of time, the least challenge to core beliefs, and low amounts of intrusive and deliberate rumination. The long-term small-growth group (Cluster 3) was primarily characterized by small amounts of PTG over longer periods of time. The high-growth group (Cluster 4) was characterized by high PTG, regardless of time, greater challenge to core beliefs, the highest amount of deliberate rumination, and the highest number of PTSD symptoms. Findings underscore heterogeneity within military veterans’ experiences of PTG over time.",3

We tested the cognitive mediation hypothesis above in a previously published psychosocial group intervention among war-affected children. We also examined heterogeneity in children's PTCs during the intervention. We used a cluster randomized trial of Smith et al.'s (2002) teaching recovery techniques (TRT) intervention among 482 Palestinians 10-13 years of age (n = 242 for intervention group, n = 240 for control group). Children reported PTSS, PTCs, and depressive symptoms at baseline, midpoint, postintervention, and at 6-month follow-up. Path analysis results showed that TRT was not effective in reducing dysfunctional PTCs, and the reductions did not mediate intervention effects on PTSS. Using latent class growth analysis, we chose the model with 3 differing trajectories in the intervention group: high, decreasing, moderate, downward trending, and severe, stable levels of PTCs. Higher PTSS and depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with membership in the severe, stable trajectory. The intervention did not produce the kind of beneficial cognitive change needed in the cognitive mediation conceptualization. Nevertheless, cognitive changes differed substantially across children during the intervention, and were associated with their preintervention mental health status. These findings call for more detailed examination of the process of cognitive mediation.",3

We aimed to identify potential risk factors and mitigating factors for a range of psychiatric disorders in a representative military sample.We analyzed data on a representative sample of 528 Ohio Army National Guard members who were assessed in person annually for first-onset psychiatric disorders from 2008 through 2012 using structured clinical interviews. We used a multivariable discrete-time Cox proportional hazard model to determine risk factors of first-onset anxiety or mood disorders.The annualized incidence rate of any first-onset psychiatric disorder was 9.8 per 100 person-years at risk. Alcohol use disorder and major depressive disorder had the highest incidence rates among the unique disorders under study (5.0 and 4.2 per 100 person-years at risk, respectively). We found an association between respondents endorsing past-year deployment and a 29% increase in the risk of incident anxiety or mood disorder, whereas the past-year experience of any non-deployment traumatic event was associated with a 32% increase in risk of incident anxiety or mood disorder.Soldiers experience a substantial burden of first-onset alcohol use disorder and major depressive disorder annually; the experience of non-deployment-related traumatic events contributes substantially to increasing risk, suggesting that any effort aimed at mitigating mood and anxiety disorders in this population must consider the soldier's life experience and military experience.",3

WTC responders were reassessed, on average, 2.5 years later.For police WTC responders, higher levels of WTC-related PTSD symptoms at the initial visit were associated with a decreased likelihood of smoking abstinence (OR=0.98, p=.002) and with decreased smoking reduction (β=-.06, p=.012) at the follow-up visit. WTC-related PTSD symptom severity was not related to likelihood of smoking abstinence or change in number of cigarettes smoked among non-traditional responders. Post hoc analyses suggested that for police, hyperarousal PTSD symptoms were predictive of decreased abstinence likelihood at the follow-up visit (OR=0.56, p=.006).The present findings suggest that PTSD symptoms may be differentially related to smoking behavior among police and non-traditional WTC responders in a naturalistic, longitudinal investigation. Future work may benefit from exploring further which aspects of PTSD (as compared to each other and to common variance) explain smoking maintenance.",3

Trajectories were identified using repeated measures latent class analysis (RMLCA). The risk profile was based on a ranking of importance of each characteristic using Cohen's d effect sizes and odds ratios. The impact of ASD and dissociation on PTSD was examined using logistic regression analyses.Altogether, 267 patients were included. The mean age was 54.0 (SD = 16.1) and 62% were men. The prevalence rate of ASD was approximately 21.7% at baseline, and 36.1% of trauma patients exhibited PTSD at 12 months after injury. Five trajectories were identified: (1) no PTSD symptoms, (2) mild, (3) moderate, (4) subclinical, and (5) severe PTSD symptoms. These trajectories seemed to remain stable over time. Compared with patients in other trajectories, patients with ASD and (subclinical) PTSD were younger and scored higher on anxiety, depressive symptoms, neuroticism, and trait anxiety. Regarding dissociation symptoms, inability to recall memories about the event was significantly more present than an altered sense of reality, (105 (40.7%) versus 56 (21.7%), p = .031), although that symptom had the strongest likelihood for PTSD. Patients with dissociation were significantly at risk for PTSD than patients without dissociation (OR = 4.82; 95%CI: 1.91-12.25).Psychological factors characterized ASD and trajectories of PTSD during 12 months post-trauma. Healthcare providers who are aware of these findings could early identify patients at risk for ASD and PTSD and refer them for patient-centred interventions.Antecedentes: El curso y las diferentes características del trastorno de estrés agudo y postraumático (TEA, TEPT) en poblaciones traumatizadas no están claros.Objetivo: Los objetivos fueron identificar las trayectorias longitudinales del TEPT, establecer un perfil de riesgo para el TEA y el TEPT basado en las características sociodemográficas, clínicas y psicológicas de los pacientes, y estudiar el efecto del TEA y la disociación en el TEPT durante los 12 meses posteriores al trauma.Método: Los pacientes completaron cuestionarios tras la inclusión y a los 3, 6, 9 y 12 meses después. Las trayectorias se identificaron mediante un análisis de clases latentes de medidas repetidas (RMLCA). El perfil de riesgo se basó en una clasificación de la importancia de cada característica utilizando los tamaños del efecto d de Cohen y cocientes de probabilidades (odds ratios). El impacto del TEA y la disociación en el TEPT se examinó mediante análisis de regresión logística.Resultados: En total, se incluyeron 267 pacientes. La edad media era de 54,0 (SD = 16,1) y el 62% eran hombres. La tasa de prevalencia de TEA fue de aproximadamente el 21,7% al inicio, y el 36,1% de los pacientes traumatizados presentaban TEPT a los 12 meses de la lesión. Se identificaron cinco trayectorias: (1) sin síntomas de TEPT, (2) leve, (3) moderada, (4) subclínica y (5) síntomas graves de TEPT. Estas trayectorias parecían permanecer estables a lo largo del tiempo. En comparación con los pacientes de otras trayectorias, los pacientes con TEA y TEPT (subclínico) eran más jóvenes y puntuaban más alto en ansiedad, síntomas depresivos, rasgos de neuroticismo y ansiedad. En cuanto a los síntomas de disociación, la incapacidad de recordar el suceso estaba significativamente más presente que la alteración del sentido de la realidad (105 (40,7%) frente a 56 (21,7%), p = 0,031), aunque este síntoma tenía la probabilidad más alta de TEPT. Los pacientes con disociación tenían un riesgo significativo de TEPT que los pacientes sin disociación (OR = 4,82; IC 95%: 1,91-12,25).Conclusiones: Los factores psicológicos caracterizaron el TEA y las trayectorias del TEPT durante los 12 meses posteriores al trauma. Los profesionales de la salud que conozcan estos hallazgos podrían identificar precozmente a los pacientes con riesgo de TEA y TEPT y remitirlos a intervenciones centradas en el paciente.背景: 创伤人群中急性和创伤后应激障碍 (ASD, PTSD) 的病程和不同特征尚不清楚。目的: 旨在确定 PTSD 的纵向轨迹, 根据患者的社会人口学, 临床和心理特征确定 ASD 和 PTSD 的风险剖面, 并研究 ASD 和解离对创伤后 12 个月内 PTSD 的影响。方法: 患者在被纳入后以及之后的 3, 6, 9 和 12 个月完成问卷。使用重复测量潜在类别分析 (RMLCA) 确定轨迹。风险剖面基于使用 Cohen’s d效应量和优势比对每个特征的重要性进行排序。使用逻辑回归分析考查 ASD 和解离对 PTSD 的影响。结果: 共纳入267 例患者。平均年龄为 54.0 (SD = 16.1), 62% 为男性。基线时 ASD 流行率约为 21.7%, 36.1% 的创伤患者在受伤后 12 个月时表现出 PTSD。确定了五个轨迹:(1) 无 PTSD 症状, (2) 轻度, (3) 中度, (4) 亚临床和 (5) 重度 PTSD 症状。随着时间的推移, 这些轨迹似乎保持稳定。与其他轨迹患者相比, 患有 ASD 和 (亚临床) PTSD 的患者更年轻, 在焦虑, 抑郁症状, 神经质和特质焦虑方面得分更高。关于解离症状, 无法回忆起事件相关记忆显著多于现实感改变 (105 (40.7%) 对 56 (21.7%), p = .031), 尽管这一症状最有可能发生 PTSD。与无解离患者相比, 有解离患者患 PTSD 的风险显著 (OR = 4.82; 95% CI:1.91-12.25)。结论: 心理因素表征了 ASD 和创伤后 12 个月内 PTSD 的轨迹。了解这些发现的医护提供者可以尽早识别出 ASD 和 PTSD 风险患者, 并为其提供以患者为中心的干预措施。.",3

One of these factors, parental psychopathology, has consistently been indicated as associated with and predictive of child functioning post-disaster. In related areas of violence exposure, researchers have gone beyond correlation and prediction in their attempt to elucidate the relationship between parental psychopathology and child functioning post-trauma. Such researchers have investigated and confirmed parental psychopathology as a moderator variable in the relationship between child violence exposure and child functioning. Thus, in considering the status of research regarding risk factors of child functioning post-disaster and the identification of parental psychopathology as a moderator within violence exposure research, the current study attempted to elucidate this possible relationship in a disaster-exposed sample. Participants consisted of 260 children and their mothers who were displaced from New Orleans due to Hurricane Katrina in the late summer of 2005. Child participants completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition-Self Report of Personality, the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index, and the Child Hurricane-Related Traumatic Experiences, among other questionnaires utilized for a larger grant-funded research study. Mother participants completed a demographic questionnaire, the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition-Parent Report Scale, the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised, and the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale, among other questionnaires utilized for a larger grant-funded research study. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that maternal psychopathology and maternal PTSD were found to v moderate the relation between child hurricane exposure and mother-reported child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Clinical implications, future research directions, as well as the current study’s strength and limitations are discussed.",3

In this paper, we employed retrospective chart reviews to extract information on trauma histories, PTSD, substance use, and psychosocial factors in a sample of 282 clients from four ACT teams (178 males; 104 females) to assess the gender differences in types of trauma, instances of PTSD, substances of choice, problematic substance use, and the SMI-PTSD model. Results indicated that rates of sexual trauma, emotional abuse, serious suicide attempts, rates of trauma in adulthood and PTSD were higher among women, whereas rates of alcohol, marijuana, and stimulant use as well as lifetime problematic substance use were higher among men. In terms of the SMI-PTSD model, results suggest that the model fits the experiences and possible trajectory of men with SMI better. Future work should investigate gender differences and gendered trajectories around the complex relationships between SMI, trauma, PTSD, substance use and examine how the SMI-PTSD model applies to persons of diverse backgrounds.",4

In such contexts, abbreviated trauma treatments are needed.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of an abbreviated eight-session version of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT) for improving posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms in a sample of South African adolescents.Method: 75 trauma-exposed adolescents (21 males, 54 females; mean age = 14.92, range = 11-19) with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were randomly assigned to eight sessions of TF-CBT or to usual services. At baseline, post-treatment and three-month follow-up, participants completed the Child PTSD Symptom Scale for DSM 5 (CPSS-5) and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). The trial is registered on the Pan African Trial Registry (PACTR202011506380839).6.Results: 95% of TF-CBT participants completed treatment while only 47% of TAU participants accessed treatment. Intention-to-treat analyses found that the TF-CBT group had a significantly greater reduction in CPSS-5 PTSD symptom severity at post-treatment (Cohen's d = 0. 60, p < .01) and three-month follow-up (Cohen's d = 0.62, p < . 01), and a greater reduction in the proportion of participants meeting the CPSS-5 clinical cut-off for PTSD at both time points (p = .02 and p = .03, respectively). There was also a significantly greater reduction in depression symptom severity in the TF-CBT group at post-treatment (Cohen's d = 0.51, p = .03) and three-month follow-up (Cohen's d = 0.41, p = .05), and a greater reduction in the proportion of TF-CBT participants meeting the BDI clinical cut-off for depression at both time points (p = .02 and p = .03, respectively).Conclusion: The findings provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of an abbreviated eight-session version of TF-CBT for reducing PTSD and depression symptoms in a LMIC sample of adolescents with multiple trauma exposure.Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT) is one of the leading evidence-based treatments for child and adolescent posttraumatic stress, but an abbreviated version has not been evaluated in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).At post-treatment and three-month follow-up, eight sessions of TF-CBT were more effective than treatment-as-usual in reducing posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms in an LMIC sample of South African adolescents exposed to multiple traumas.Effect sizes were similar to those reported for standard length TF-CBT, indicating that abbreviated TF-CBT may be a suitable option for resource-constrained child and adolescent mental health services in LMICs.",4

However, the relationship between burnout and PTSD in firefighters has rarely been studied. This study therefore explored the association between burnout and its related factors, such as trauma and violence, and PTSD symptoms among firefighters in Korea. Methods A total of 535 firefighters participated in the Firefighter Research on Enhancement of Safety & Health study at 3 university hospitals from 2016 to 2017. The 535 participants received a baseline health examination, including questionnaires assessing their mental health. A Web-based survey was also conducted to collect data on job-related stress, history of exposure to violence, burnout, and trauma experience. The associations among burnout, its related factors, and PTSD symptoms were investigated using structural equation modeling. Results Job demands (Î²=0.411, p<0.001) and effort-reward balance (Î²=-0.290, p<0.001) were significantly related to burnout. Burnout (Î²=0.237, p<0.001) and violence (Î²=0.123, p=0.014) were significantly related to PTSD risk. Trauma (Î²=0.131, p=0.001) was significantly related to burnout; however, trauma was not directly associated with PTSD scores (Î²=0.085, p=0.081). Conclusions Our results show that burnout and psychological, sexual, and physical violence at the hands of clients directly affected participantsâ PTSD symptoms. Burnout mediated the relationship between trauma experience and PTSD. Key words: Firefighters, Psychological burnout, Post-traumatic stress disorders, Occupational stress",4

In total, 304 students from a school located in Lushan County were assessed by UCLA PTSD-RI at 1.5, 6, 12, 24 and 48 months after the earthquake. The children ages ranged from 9 to 17 years old at the time of the first assessment, and the sample included 140 males and 164 females. Four trajectories of PTSD symptoms were found, namely, resilience (53.8%), low symptoms (32.6%), recovery (7.0%), and chronic dysfunction (6.6%). Then, a logistic regression analysis that controlled for gender and grade showed that compared with the resilience group, children with an injury or probable acute stress disorder (ASD) were likely to be in the recovery group, children with probable ASD were more likely to be in the low-symptoms group, and children with a bad relationship with their father were more likely to be in the chronic group. The participants were selected by convenience principle. All children received an intervention after the earthquake. These findings suggest that increasing children's social support may relieve children's PTSD symptoms. We should consider both perceived threat and object exposure in future studies. The posttraumatic stress response was very high and was unstable during the first month after the earthquake, which suggests that psychological first aid is necessary in posttraumatic events.",4

Harmful drinking, depression, psychological distress, disability, episodic memory and working memory did not improve significantly over the 2 years following injury. For other measures, including the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms and Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI), LGC analysis revealed significant improvement over time with recovery tending to plateau at 3-6 months.Significant impairment may persist as late as 2 years after mTBI despite some recovery over time. Longitudinal analyses which make use of all available data indicate that recovery from mTBI occurs over a longer timescale than is commonly believed. These findings point to the need for long-term management of mTBI targeting individuals with persisting impairment.",4

There is limited evidence about this relationship among National Guard, a group that may be at higher risk of behavioral health concerns compared to Active Component. The current study used cross-sectional data from a clinical subsample of soldiers (N = 455) from the Ohio Army National Guard Mental Health Initiative. Soldiers completed self-report and clinician-rated measures, including demographics, smoking status and intensity, and PTSD. Logistic and multinomial regression methods were used to explore the association between PTSD symptomatology and smoking. Higher PTSD symptom severity was modestly associated with an increased likelihood of being a current (β = 0.02, p = 0.049, OR = 1.02) and heavy smoker (β = 0.04, p = 0.003, OR = 1.04). Reporting more dysphoria or hyperarousal symptoms was modestly associated with an increased likelihood of being a heavy smoker (β = 0.04, p = 0.001, OR = 1.05; β = 0.03, p = 0.03, OR = 1.03). Those with greater PTSD severity are more likely to smoke and have more difficulty quitting; this may have implications for efforts to mitigate the burden of PTSD and smoking among National Guard personnel.",4

We therefore examined the effects of mothers’ exposure to Hurricane Katrina on adolescent children’s mental health 12 years later, distinguishing between direct effects of disaster exposure and effects mediated by maternal distress, and evaluating moderation by child age and gender. Data were from a 2003–2018 study of young, low-income, primarily African American mothers living in New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina occurred in 2005 (n = 328). Mothers rated their mental health about one year pre-Katrina and one, four, and 12 years afterwards. They reported on an adolescent child’s (ages 10–17, mean = 14.46) internalizing and externalizing symptoms 12 years post-Katrina using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Path analytic models adjusting for mothers’ pre-disaster distress showed that, whereas the direct effects of maternal hurricane exposures on child mental health were not significant, the indirect effects were. Specifically, mothers who experienced more Katrina-related stressors had higher distress thereafter, which predicted poorer child outcomes. Results did not differ significantly by child age. Gender differences are discussed. Findings suggest that disasters can affect child mental health for many years, even for those who were very young or not yet born at the time, due to parents’ disaster-related distress. Addressing parents’ mental health needs in the aftermath of disasters may improve child well-being long-term.",4

https://openalex.org/W2325602917,10.1037/ort0000039,Coping with war trauma and psychological distress among school-age Palestinian children.,"This study investigated the long-term effects of the 2012 war on children's psychological distress in Gaza Strip. It was hypothesized that a) greater levels of exposure to war trauma would be associated with greater behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms; b) children who rely more on problem-focused coping will manifest less behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms whereas children who rely more on emotion-focused coping will manifest higher levels of behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD symptoms; and c) certain children's characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and family income) would be predictive of children's behavioral and emotional disorders, neuroticism, and PTSD. Participants were 205 males and females aged 9 to 16 years. Questionnaires were administered in an interview format with participants at schools. Results indicated that approximately 30 percent of the Palestinian children who were exposed to higher levels of war traumas have developed PTSD with excess risk for co-morbidity with other disorders such as emotional symptoms and neuroticism. The findings revealed that children with lower family income reported higher levels of emotion and behavioral disorders and neuroticism. While emotion-focused coping was positively associated with emotional and behavioral problems, neuroticism, and PTSD, problem-focused coping was negatively associated with neuroticism and PTSD. The clinical implications of these conclusions were discussed to formulate cognitive-behavioral coping interventions that can lead to positive outcomes in the posttrauma environment.",5

Although women are generally considered at increased PTSD risk, sex and gender differences in PTSD symptom trajectories have not yet been extensively studied.To perform an in-depth investigation of differences in PTSD symptom trajectories across one-year post-trauma between men and women, by interpreting the general trends of trajectories observed in sex-disaggregated samples, and comparing within-trajectory symptom course and prevalence rates.We included N = 554 participants (62.5% men, 37.5% women) from a multi-centre prospective cohort of emergency department patients with suspected severe injury. PTSD symptom severity was assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-trauma, using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV. Latent growth mixture modelling on longitudinal PTSD symptoms was performed within the sex-disaggregated whole samples. Bayesian modelling with informative priors was applied for reliable model estimation, considering the imbalanced prevalence of the expected latent trajectories.In terms of general trends, the same trajectories were observed for men and women, i.e. resilient, recovery, chronic symptoms and delayed onset. Within-trajectory symptom courses were largely comparable, but resilient women had higher symptoms than resilient men. Sex differences in prevalence rates were observed for the recovery (higher in women) and delayed onset (higher in men) trajectories. Model fit for the sex-disaggregated samples was better than for the whole sample, indicating preferred application of sex-disaggregation. Analyses within the whole sample led to biased estimates of overall and sex-specific trajectory prevalence rates.Sex-disaggregated trajectory analyses revealed limited sex differences in PTSD symptom trajectories within one-year post-trauma in terms of general trends, courses and prevalence rates. The observed biased trajectory prevalence rates in the whole sample emphasize the necessity to apply appropriate statistical techniques when conducting sex-sensitive research.Antecedentes: Los últimos años han demostrado una mayor aplicación de enfoques prospectivos orientados a la trayectoria para el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT). Aunque generalmente se considera que las mujeres tienen un mayor riesgo de TEPT, las diferencias de sexo y género en las trayectorias de los síntomas del TEPT aún no se han estudiado ampliamente.Objetivo: Realizar una investigación en profundidad de las diferencias en las trayectorias de los síntomas del TEPT a lo largo de un año después de un trauma entre hombres y mujeres, interpretando las tendencias generales de las trayectorias observadas en muestras desagregadas por sexo, así como comparar el curso y la evolución de los síntomas dentro de la trayectoria y las tasas de prevalencia.Método: Incluimos N = 554 participantes (62.5% hombres, 37.5% mujeres) de una cohorte prospectiva multicéntrica de pacientes del servicio de urgencias con sospecha de lesión grave. La gravedad de los síntomas del TEPT se evaluó 1, 3, 6 y 12 meses después del trauma, utilizando la Escala de TEPT administrada por un médico para el DSM-IV. Se realizó un modelo de mezcla de crecimiento latente sobre los síntomas longitudinales de TEPT en las muestras desagregadas por sexo y en la muestra completa. Se aplicó un modelo bayesiano con antecedentes informativos para una estimación confiable del modelo, considerando la prevalencia desequilibrada de las trayectorias latentes esperadas.Resultados: En términos de tendencias generales, se observaron las mismas trayectorias para hombres y mujeres, es decir, resiliente, recuperación, síntomas crónicos y aparición tardía. Los cursos de síntomas dentro de la trayectoria fueron en gran medida comparables, pero las mujeres resilientes tenían más síntomas másque los hombres resilientes. Se observaron diferencias por sexo en las tasas de prevalencia para las trayectorias de recuperación (mayor en mujeres) y de inicio tardío (mayor en hombres). El ajuste del modelo para las muestras desagregadas por sexo fue mejor que para la muestra completa, lo que indica la aplicación preferida de la desagregación por sexo. Los análisis de la muestra completa llevaron a estimaciones sesgadas de las tasas de prevalencia de trayectorias generales y específicas por sexo.Conclusiones: Los análisis de trayectoria desagregados por sexo revelaron diferencias limitadas entre los sexos en las trayectorias de los síntomas del TEPT durante el año posterior al trauma en términos de tendencias generales, cursos y tasas de prevalencia. Las tasas de prevalencia de trayectoria sesgada observadas en el conjunto de la muestra enfatizan la necesidad de aplicar técnicas estadísticas apropiadas al realizar investigaciones que tengan en cuenta el sexo.背景: 近年来, 前瞻性轨迹导向方法在创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 中的应用有所增加。尽管通常认为女性 PTSD 有更高的风险, 尚未对 PTSD 症状轨迹中的性别和性别差异进行广泛研究。目的: 通过解读在性别分类样本中观察到轨迹的一般趋势, 以及比较轨迹内症状过程和流行率, 对创伤后一年内 PTSD 症状轨迹的男女差异进行深入考查。方法: 我们纳入了 N= 554 名参与者 (62.5% 男性, 37.5% 女性), 这些参与者来自多中心前瞻性队列疑似严重受伤的急诊科患者。在创伤后 1, 3, 6 和 12 个月, 使用DSM-IV临床用 PTSD 量表评估 PTSD 症状严重程度。在性别分类样本和整个样本中对纵向 PTSD 症状进行了潜在增长混合模型。考虑到预期潜在轨迹的流行率不平衡, 应用了具有信息先验的贝叶斯模型进行可靠模型估计。结果: 就总体趋势而言, 男性和女性观察到相同的轨迹, 即韧性, 恢复, 慢性症状和延迟发作组。轨迹内的症状过程在很大程度上具有可比性, 但韧性组女性比韧性组男性有更高的症状。在恢复组 (女性较高) 和延迟发病组 (男性较高) 轨迹中观察到流行率的性别差异。性别分类样本的模型拟合优于整个样本, 表明首选应用性别分类。对整个样本的分析导致对总体和特定性别轨迹流行率估计有偏。结论: 性别分类轨迹分析揭示了创伤后一年内 PTSD 症状轨迹在总体趋势, 病程和流行率方面的性别差异有限。在整个样本中观察到的有偏轨迹流行率强调了在进行性别敏感性研究时应用适当统计技术的必要性。.",5

Data of 116 workers representing emergency services (37.1% firefighters, 37.1%, police officers and 30% medical rescue workers) who have experienced a traumatic event in their worksite were analyzed. The range of age of the participants was 21-57 years (M=35.27; SD=8.13). Polish versions of the Impact of Event Scale--Revised and the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory were used to assess the negative and positive outcomes of the experienced event. A perceived social support scale was measured by the scale What support you can count on. The data obtained from the study revealed the negative dependence of social support from supervisors with PTSD symptoms and positive--social support from co-workers with post-traumatic growth. Moreover the results of the study indicate the positive relationship between negative and positive outcomes of experienced traumatic events in the workplace. Perceived social support plays a more important role in gaining benefits from trauma than preventing negative outcomes of the experienced traumatic event. Support from co-workers, compared to support from supervisors, has greater importance.",5

Identification of recovery trajectories improves our ability to understand the natural history of mild TBI recovery and develop targeted interventions.To utilize group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) to identify distinct patterns of symptom recovery following mild TBI in the first 6 months after mild TBI.This study is comprised of 253 adults who presented to the emergency department with mild TBI and completed assessments for six-months post-injury. Patients were recruited for the prospective observational cohort study, HeadSMART. The primary outcome measure was the Rivermead Postconcussion Symptom Questionnaire. GBTM was used to identify longitudinal trajectories of recovery following mild TBI using Rivermead scores at baseline, one, three, and six months following diagnosis.Findings identified four distinct trajectories of symptom recovery follwing mild TBI including 9% of participants who were categorized with minimal acute symptoms that decreased over time, 45% with mild acute symptoms that decreased over time, 33% with relatively higher acute symptoms that decreased over time, and 13% with relatively higher acute symptoms that increased over time.GBTM identified four distinct trajectories of recovery following mild TBI and GBTM may be useful for research interventions that can alter recovery trajectories.",5

We investigated the impact of life events and changes in mental health status on AUDIT scores over time in UK military personnel. A random representative sample of regular UK military personnel who had been serving in 2003 were surveyed in 2004–2006 (phase 1) and again in 2007–2009 (phase 2). The impact of changes in symptoms of psychological distress, probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), marital status, serving status, rank, deployment to Iraq/Afghanistan and smoking was assessed between phases. We found a statistically significant but small decrease in AUDIT scores between phases 1 and 2 (mean change = −1.01, 95% confidence interval = −1.14, −0.88). Participants reported a decrease in AUDIT scores if they experienced remission in psychological distress (adjusted mean −2.21, 95% CI −2.58, −1.84) and probable PTSD (adjusted mean −3.59, 95% CI −4.41, −2.78), if they stopped smoking (adjusted mean −1.41, 95% CI −1.83, −0.98) and were in a new relationship (adjusted mean −2.77, 95% CI −3.15, −2.38). On the other hand, reporting new onset or persistent symptoms of probable PTSD (adjusted mean 1.34, 95% CI 0.71, 1.98) or a relationship breakdown (adjusted mean 0.53, 95% CI 0.07, 0.99) at phase 2 were associated with an increase in AUDIT scores. The overall level of hazardous alcohol consumption remains high in the UK military. Changes in AUDIT scores were linked to mental health and life events but not with deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan.",5

Social Support, Psychological Improvement, and Resilience After the Virginia Tech Campus Shootings","People’s responses to acute stress are largely thought to comprise four prototypical patterns of resilience, gradual recovery, chronic distress, and delayed distress. Here we present evidence of an additional response pattern: psychological improvement. Female survivors of the Virginia Tech shootings ( N = 368) completed assessments before the shootings and at 2, 6, and 12 months post-shooting. Latent growth mixture modeling revealed distinct trajectories of resilience, chronic distress, delayed distress, continuous distress, and improvement. Although resilience was the most common pattern (56%–59%), a trajectory of substantial improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms also emerged among 13.2% and 7.4% of the sample, respectively. In support of this pattern, improvement was distinctively associated with marked increases in perceived social support and gains in interpersonal resources. Findings suggest a more complex understanding of the impact of mass trauma and a key role for dynamic changes in social support following acute stress.",5

Design/methodology/approach This was a cross-sectional study involving 152 elder people who survived the disaster and were selected conveniently. The study was conducted in two worst-affected districts of Lombok Utara regency. PTSD was diagnosed using a modified version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale version 5 (CAPS-5). The demographic data were assessed using a self-developed questionnaire consisting of 13 items. All data were analyzed by descriptive analysis, χ 2 test and binary logistic regression with p &lt;0.05. Findings Out of the 152 elder people, 91 (59.9 percent) suffered PTSD. Intrusion symptoms were the most common symptoms experienced by the respondents (94.1 percent). The factors associated with the PTSD in the elderly after the earthquake were having chronic illnesses (OR=2.490; 95% CI=1.151–5.385), public health center utilization (OR=2.200; 95% CI=1.068–4.535) and occupational status before the disaster (OR=2.726; 95% CI=1.296–5.730). These findings highlight that individual factors and access to health care services remain an important aspect of stress identification among the elderly following the disaster event. Social implications Elder people constitute a vulnerable group that is often forgotten and neglected during post-disaster recovery, though they have potentially higher psychosocial distress than younger age groups. This study was conducted to raise awareness about mental health problems suffered by the elderly. Originality/value This is the first study to apply CAPS-5 to assess PTSD among Indonesian elderly people following a natural disaster. This paper also provides insights that can be used by governments and other relevant parties to address PTSD problems suffered by many elderly people in a post-disaster area.",5

While the lack of social support influences PTSD symptomatology, it is unknown how changes in perceived social support affect the PTSD symptom level in the aftermath of deployment. Furthermore, the influence of specific sources of social support from pre- to post-deployment on level of PTSD symptoms is unknown. We aim to examine how changes in perceived social support (overall and from specific sources) from pre- to 2.5 year post-deployment are associated with the level of post-deployment PTSD symptoms.Danish army military personnel deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 and 2013 completed questionnaires at pre-deployment and at 2.5 year post-deployment measuring perceived social support and PTSD symptomatology and sample characteristics of the two cohorts. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate nominal logistic regression.Negative changes in perceived social support from pre- to post-deployment were associated with both moderate (OR 1.99, CI 1.51-2.57) and high levels (OR 2.71, CI 1.94-3.78) of PTSD symptoms 2.5 year post-deployment (adjusted analysis). Broadly, the same direction was found for specific sources of social support and level of PTSD symptoms. In the adjusted analyses, pre-deployment perceived social support and military rank moderated the associations.Deterioration in perceived social support (overall and specific sources) from pre- to 2.5 year post-deployment increases the risk of an elevated level of PTSD symptoms 2.5 year post-deployment.",6

Using data from the longitudinal, observational Substance Use and Psychological Injury Combat (SUPIC) Study, we explored the self‐report of 4 combat exposure items and postdeployment behavioral health screening results for 42,397 Army enlisted women who had returned from Afghanistan or Iraq from fiscal years 2008 through 2011. We ran multivariate logistic regression models to examine how a constructed composite combat exposure score (0, 1, 2, 3+) was associated with screening positive postdeployment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and at‐risk drinking among active duty (AD) and National Guard/Reserve (NG/R) women. AD and NG/R women commonly reported being wounded, injured, assaulted, or hurt (17.3% and 29.0%, respectively). In all 6 multivariate models, Army women with any report of combat exposure had increased odds of the behavioral health problem (i.e., PTSD, depression, or at‐risk drinking). The magnitude of the association between combat exposure and PTSD was most striking, indicating increased odds of PTSD as combat exposure score increased. AD and NG/R women with a combat exposure score of 3+ had increased odds of PTSD, 20.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) [17.0, 25.1] and 27.8, 95% CI [21.0, 36.9], respectively. Women who report combat exposure may benefit from early prevention and confidential intervention to promote postdeployment health and reduce long‐term behavioral health problems.",6

Design: A cross-sectional analysis of the 3-month postinjury data from a larger, prospective, longitudinal study. Methods: Parents and their child aged 2 to 12 years who presented at the emergency department with either a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or a superficial injury to the head (SIH) were recruited. Parents reported their child's symptoms at the time of injury and at 3 months postinjury. Child, family/parent, and injury characteristics were considered as potential predictors. Logistic regression was conducted to determine which factors increase the likelihood of parents' PCS report. Results: At 3 months postinjury, 30% and 13% of children in the mTBI and SIH groups exhibited 1 or more symptoms, respectively. On the other hand, 18% (mTBI) and 8% (SIH) continued to have ongoing problems when 2 or more symptoms were considered at follow-up. The final model, which included child's sex, injury group, number of symptoms at the time of injury, and parental stress, had a significant predictive utility in determining parents' report of 1 or more symptoms at follow-up. Only parental stress continued to be a significant predictor when considering 2 or more symptoms at 3 months postinjury. Conclusions: Children with mTBI have worse outcomes than children with SIH at follow-up, with parents more likely to report 1 or more ongoing symptoms if their children had an mTBI. Postinjury assessment of parental stress and ongoing symptom monitoring in young children with mTBI will allow for timely provision of support for the family.",6

Trauma research suggests increased problems in maternal mental health and infant development. Yet many cognitive-emotional processes affect the trauma survivors' mental health, such as post-traumatic growth and post-traumatic cognition. The aim of this study was to examine whether a mother's high post-traumatic growth and optimal post-traumatic cognition could protect their own mental health and their infant's stress regulation from the effects of traumatic war experiences.MethodsThis three-wave prospective study involved Palestinian women living in the Gaza Strip who were at the second trimester of pregnancy (T1), women with infants aged 4 months (T2), and women with children aged 12 months (T3) months. The participants reported their war experiences in a 30-item checklist of losses, destruction, and atrocities in the 2008–09, 2012, and 2014 military offensives. Post-traumatic growth was assessed by a 21-item scale and post-traumatic cognition by a 36-item scale. Maternal mental health was assessed by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive, anxiety, and dissociation symptoms at T1 and T3, and infants' stress regulation was assessed with the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire at T2 and T3.FindingsWe included 511 women at T1, 481 women at T2, and 454 women at T3. High maternal post-traumatic growth and post-traumatic cognition had protective roles. Post-traumatic growth had a protective effect on maternal mental health since severe exposure to traumatic war experiences was not associated with maternal PTSD, depression, and dissociation if women showed high post-traumatic growth, as indicated by the significant interaction effect between post-traumatic growth and war trauma on each of the three symptoms. Post-traumatic cognition had a protective effect on infant development since severe exposure was not associated with dysfunctional infant emotion regulation when mothers reported optimal post-traumatic cognition, as indicated by the significant interaction effect between post-traumatic cognition and war trauma on each of negative affectivity and surgency or extraversion.InterpretationThe nature of cognitive emotional processing of war trauma could explain the distinct roles of post-traumatic growth and post-traumatic cognition. High post-traumatic growth involves increased social affiliation, spiritual awareness, and psychological strengths resulting from painful and traumatic experiences. In the national struggle for independence, post-traumatic growth is often associated with heroism and even hardiness, which might benefit a mother's mental health but not their infant's wellbeing. Optimal post-traumatic cognition indicates successful and harmonious trauma processing, which enables mothers to be more reflective and sensitive to their infant's needs. Interventions to promote healthy infant development in war settings should encourage and support mothers' effective cognitive-emotional processing of traumatic experiences.FundingThe Academy of Finland and University of Tampere, Finland.",6

The present study examined the levels of psychological distress and resilience factors among 106 Palestinian refugee children aged 11 to 17 in the West Bank. In a cross-sectional, mixed method design along with qualitative interviews, three questionnaires were administered: the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and Patient Health Questionnaire-15, assessed the risk of mental health disorders and psychosomatic complaints, and the Child and Youth Resilience Measure assessed the availability of resilience-enhancing factors. Palestinian refugee children were found to be at greater risk for mental disorders and psychosomatic complaints than were children living in non-conflict affected settings. In addition, resilience-enhancing resources were significantly reduced and were negatively correlated with both symptom outcomes. Risk factors identified included poverty, violence and marginalisation. Key protective factors were youth education, supportive relationships and social participation. Our findings support interventions that address the identified protective factors, which may promote the mental health of this vulnerable population.",6

A dichotomous distinction among these events involves the witnessing of threat or harm to others and the experiencing of threat or harm directly to oneself. Past research suggests that different types of trauma exposure produce varying levels of negative posttraumatic responses including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and positive outcomes such as posttraumatic growth (PTG). With the goal of better assisting officers experiencing posttraumatic stress, enhanced knowledge regarding this psychological response to the development of PTG is necessary.The purpose of this study was to test a proposed model involving a pathway from type of trauma exposure to PTG that is mediated by PTSD symptoms among law enforcement officers (N = 193). Differences among cognitive PTG and behavioral PTG as our dependent variables, with age, marital status, and relationship stress as control variables, were assessed.Findings indicate that events involving threat to self are more closely related to PTG, via an indirect pathway through PTSD symptoms. Additionally, personal relationship stress was directly associated with PTSD symptoms and behavioral PTG, but not cognitive PTG.Overall, the results of this study provide initial evidence that trauma exposure type (i.e., direct vs. indirect) plays a significant role in the level of PTG. Lastly, the results allow for the possibility of positive changes in behaviors facilitated by cognitive avoidance, in contrast to the common notion that deliberate cognitive engagement is required for growth to occur.

Vulnerable populations, such as people with low income and racial and ethnic minorities, are particularly prone to increased levels of physical harm and psychiatric adversity from weather-related events.Objectives: We aimed to explore psychosocial resources and coping of survivors with three different posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) trajectories (High-Decreasing, Moderate-Decreasing, and High-Stable), after Hurricane Katrina across two different time points: F1 (1-year post-disaster) and F3 (12 years post-disaster).Method: Participants in this multi-method study were part of a larger cohort of the Resilience in Survivors of Katrina (RISK) project. Transcripts of interviews completed at the two time points were analysed using two qualitative methods, combining thematic analysis and narrative analysis, and providing both breadth of perspectives with the depth of specific case studies.Results: Sixteen survivors completed interviews at both F1 and F3. From our in-depth analysis of the data, we derived five inductive themes: 'Hope,' 'Adaptive vs maladaptive avoidance,' 'Emotional delay,' 'Acceptance, Finding Meaning and Being in the Moment,' and 'Coping strategies.' Survivors with High-Decreasing and Moderate-Decreasing PTSS trajectories experienced hope for future, accepted the hurricane and its results, and found efficient ways to cope with their situation. Survivors with High-Stable PTSS trajectories tended to express a lack of hope for future and struggled to be mindful and accept the hurricane and its harm. Unlike survivors with High-Decreasing and Moderate-Decreasing PTSS trajectories, survivors with High-Stable PTSS trajectories also reported less social and family support and faced more discrimination and racism.Conclusion: There are factors beyond individual-level psychosocial resources that may shape post-disaster resilience. When supporting survivors after a weather-related disaster, it is essential to provide ongoing psychological, financial, and physical assistance to bolster these resources.After Hurricane Katrina, survivors with different posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories reported different levels of hope, mindfulness, and willingness to talk about the hurricane, emotional processing, and coping strategies.These experiences varied over time for survivors in all three trajectories.Survivors who report ongoing high levels of symptoms should be offered additional support to bolster these psychosocial resources.",6

We hypothesized that pretrauma characteristics of the person could predict posttrauma severity and recovery.Sex, age, body mass index, income, education level, employment status, pre-existing chronic pain or psychopathology, and recent life stressors were collected from adults with acute musculoskeletal trauma through self-report. In study 1 (cross-sectional, n=128), pain severity was captured using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), distress through the Traumatic Injuries Distress Scale (TIDS) and depression through the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). In study 2 (longitudinal, n=112) recovery was predicted using scores on the Satisfaction and Recovery Index (SRI) and differences within and between classes were compared with identify pre-existing predictors of posttrauma recovery.Through bivariate, linear and nonlinear, and regression analyses, 8.4% (BPI) to 42.9% (PHQ-9) of variance in acute-stage predictors of chronicity was explainable through variables knowable before injury. In study 2 (longitudinal), latent growth curve analysis identified 3 meaningful SRI trajectories over 12 months. Trajectory 1 (start satisfied, stay satisfied [51%]) was identifiable by lower TIDS, BPI, and PHQ-9 scores, higher household income and less likely psychiatric comorbidity. The other 2 trajectories (start dissatisfied, stay dissatisfied [29%] versus start dissatisfied, become satisfied [20%]) were similar across most variables at baseline save for the ""become satisfied"" group being mean 10 years older and entering the study with a worse (lower) SRI score.The results indicate that 3 commonly reported predictors of chronic musculoskeletal pain (BPI, TIDS, PHQ-9) could be predicted by variables not related to the injurious event itself. The 3-trajectory recovery model mirrors other prior research in the field, though 2 trajectories look very similar at baseline despite very different 12-month outcomes. Researchers are encouraged to design studies that integrate, rather than exclude, the pre-existing variables described here.",6

Firefighters are exposed to traumatic stresses due to their professional nature. It is known that dealing with extra stress after the event can be a risk factor in development of the disease. Thus, we aim to study to see whether occupational stress can act as a risk factor in development of PTSD. <h3>Methods</h3> 310 among total 315 professional firefighters were given written informed consents and answered self -reported questionnaires. Impact of Event Scale-Revision (IES-R), Life Event Checklist (LEC) and Korean Occupational Stress Scale (KOSS) questionnaires were used to assess the PTSD and determine the level of occupational stress. SPSS 21.0 was used for all statistical analysis. <h3>Results</h3> According to the IES-R questionnaire, 75 out of 310 subjects (24.2%) were in risk of developing PTSD. The LEC score which is designed to screen one’s experience of potentially traumatic events was significantly high in the PTSD risk group compared to no risk group (p=0.008). Total KOSS score of PTSD risk group (49.21±10.90) was also significantly higher than that of no risk group (45.17±10.86) (p=0.005). <h3>Conclusion</h3> The prevalence of PTSD was significantly higher in firefighters than general population in several studies, and result of our study also corresponds well. Furthermore we could confirm that the more impact traumatic stress one has experienced in life, the more likely it is to develop PTSD and occupational stress is playing as a risk factor in the development of the disease. By identifying the level of occupational stress and the impact of traumatic event using simple self-reported questionnaires, it would be easier to detect the people who are in risk of developing PTSD and take early medical intervention to prevent the progression of PTSD.",7

Studies of longitudinal psychological distress among those exposed to trauma have been limited to relatively short durations of follow-up among smaller samples. Methods The current study longitudinally assessed heterogeneity in trajectories of psychological distress among WTC Health Registry enrollees – a prospective cohort health study of responders, students, employees, passersby, and residents in the affected area ( N = 30 839) – throughout a 15-year period following the WTC disaster. Rescue/recovery status and exposure to traumatic events of 9/11, as well as sociodemographic factors and health status, were assessed as risk factors for trajectories of psychological distress. Results Five psychological distress trajectory groups were found: none-stable, low-stable, moderate-increasing, moderate-decreasing, and high-stable. Of the study sample, 78.2% were classified as belonging to the none-stable or low-stable groups. Female sex, being younger at the time of 9/11, lower education and income were associated with a higher probability of being in a greater distress trajectory group relative to the none-stable group. Greater exposure to traumatic events of 9/11 was associated with a higher probability of a greater distress trajectory, and community members (passerby, residents, and employees) were more likely to be in greater distress trajectory groups – especially in the moderate-increasing [odds ratios (OR) 2.31 (1.97–2.72)] and high-stable groups [OR 2.37 (1.81–3.09)] – compared to the none-stable group. Conclusions The current study illustrated the heterogeneity in psychological distress trajectories following the 9/11 WTC disaster, and identified potential avenues for intervention in future disasters.",7

The study sample consisted of 590 Palestinian adults, consisting of 360 men and 230 women, and were recruited using non‐probabilistic convenience sampling methods from a village in the northern region of the occupied Palestinian territories. This study suggests a positive correlation between political violence and PTSS, a positive correlation between loneliness and PTSS, and a negative correlation between SOB and PTSS.

We recruited a sample of 991 Ohio Army National Guard soldiers and conducted structured interviews to assess traumatic event exposure, a history of childhood adversity, and postdeployment depression, and PTSD, consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition. We assessed childhood adversity by using questions from the Childhood Adverse Events Survey. In multivariable logistic models, a history of any childhood adversity was significantly associated with new-onset depression, but not PTSD, postdeployment. This finding suggests that a history of childhood adversity is predisposing for new-onset depression, among U.S. National Guard soldiers who were deployed with no prior history of PTSD or depression. This highlights the centrality of childhood experience for the production of mental health among soldiers.",7

Heterogeneity could be due to differences in trauma types and patient demographic characteristics.This analysis pooled data from six longitudinal studies of adult survivors of civilian-related injuries admitted to general hospital emergency departments (EDs) in six countries (pooled N = 3083). Each study included at least three assessments of the clinician-administered PTSD scale in the first post-trauma year. Latent class growth analysis determined the proportion of participants exhibiting various PTSD symptom trajectories within and across the datasets. Multinomial logistic regression analyses examined demographic characteristics, type of event leading to the injury, and trauma history as predictors of trajectories differentiated by their initial severity and course.Five trajectories were found across the datasets: Low (64.5%), Remitting (16.9%), Moderate (6.7%), High (6.5%), and Delayed (5.5%). Female gender, non-white race, prior interpersonal trauma, and assaultive injuries were associated with increased risk for initial PTSD reactions. Female gender and assaultive injuries were associated with risk for membership in the Delayed (v. Low) trajectory, and lower education, prior interpersonal trauma, and assaultive injuries with risk for membership in the High (v. Remitting) trajectory.The results suggest that over 30% of civilian-related injury survivors admitted to EDs experience moderate-to-high levels of PTSD symptoms within the first post-trauma year, with those reporting assaultive violence at increased risk of both immediate and longer-term symptoms.",7

Little is known, however, regarding the longitudinal processes of co-occurring depression and PTSD among mothers with childhood adversity. The present study addressed this research gap by examining co-occurring postpartum depression and PTSD trajectories among mothers with childhood trauma history.177 mothers with childhood trauma history reported depression and PTSD symptoms at 4, 6, 12, 15 and 18 months postpartum, as well as individual (shame, posttraumatic cognitions, dissociation) and contextual (social support, childhood and postpartum trauma experiences) factors.Growth mixture modeling (GMM) identified three comorbid change patterns: The Resilient group (64%) showed the lowest levels of depression and PTSD that remained stable over time; the Vulnerable group (23%) displayed moderately high levels of comorbid depression and PTSD; and the Chronic High-Risk group (14%) showed the highest level of comorbid depression and PTSD. Further, a path model revealed that postpartum dissociation, negative posttraumatic cognitions, shame, as well as social support, and childhood and postpartum trauma experiences differentiated membership in the Chronic High-Risk and Vulnerable. Finally, we found that children of mothers in the Vulnerable group were reported as having more externalizing and total problem behaviors.Generalizability is limited, given this is a sample of mothers with childhood trauma history and demographic risk.The results highlight the strong comorbidity of postpartum depression and PTSD among mothers with childhood trauma history, and also emphasize its aversive impact on the offspring.",7

Few studies have examined anxiety after mild TBI, and fewer have examined comorbid depression and anxiety and their trajectories over time. This study describes depression and anxiety across 48-months after mild TBI in adults (aged >15 years at injury).Methods: Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale in a sample of 341 adults with mild TBI within 2 weeks of injury and then at 6-, 12- and 48-months post-injury.Results: Mean anxiety and depression total scores decreased significantly over time. Prevalence of depression ranged from 0% to 7.7%, whilst anxiety was present in 3.7–29.5% of cases. Comorbid anxiety and depression prevalence ranged from 10.2% to 20.7%. At each time of assessment, the greatest proportion of individuals had neither depression nor anxiety (range 28–49%). The findings suggest multiple trajectories over time.Conclusions: The findings indicate that both anxiety and depression need to be screened regularly after mild TBI. Furthermore, it cannot be assumed that someone who initially presents without depression or anxiety will remain free of these as they negotiate life after injury.",8

Longitudinal study from 2006–2012. Community-based family planning clinics in southeast Texas. There were 296 women aged 18–31 y who experienced Hurricane Ike, September 2008. Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was administered every 2 mo from 6 mo before to 12 mo after Hurricane Ike. Sleep quality was assessed 1 mo after Hurricane Ike using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Good sleep was defined as a PSQI summary score < 5, and poor sleep as a score ≥ 5. Hurricane Ike stressors (e.g., property damage, subjective stressors) and pre-Ike lifetime major life events and emotional health (e.g., emotional dysregulation, self-control) were also assessed. Over the entire period of 18 mo (6 mo before and 12 mo after the hurricane), perceived stress was significantly higher among poor sleepers compared to good sleepers, and only good sleepers showed a significant decrease in perceived stress after Hurricane Ike. In addition, a higher level of perceived stress was positively associated with greater Ike damage among poor sleepers, whereas this correlation was not observed among good sleepers. In the final multivariate longitudinal model, Ike-related subjective stressors as well as baseline major life events and emotional dysregulation among poor sleepers predicted higher levels of perceived stress over time; among good sleepers, additional factors such as lower levels of self-control and having a history of a psychiatric disorder also predicted higher levels of perceived stress. Sleep quality after Hurricane Ike, an intense natural disaster producing substantial damage, impacted changes in perceived stress over time. Our findings suggest the possibility that providing victims of disasters with effective interventions to improve sleep quality could help to reduce their perceived stress over time.",8

https://openalex.org/W778832586,,The Relationship Between Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptoms and Career Outcomes of Army Enlisted Servicemembers,"Abstract : Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has emerged as one of the signature wounds of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Having provided more troop-years to these engagements than all the other services combined, the toll of PTSD has been especially burdensome for U.S. Army servicemembers. While the adverse mental and physical health outcomes associated with PTSD are well documented, the relationship between PTSD symptoms and military career milestones are often overlooked. This dissertation study endeavors to answer the question: To what extent do servicemembers with PTSD symptoms experience negative career outcomes? Using deployment, self-reported Post Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) survey, and demographic data, this study uses both logistic and duration regression to determine and describe the association between probable PTSD and Army servicemember career outcomes. Results suggest that servicemembers with probable PTSD are more likely to separate and less likely to promote compared to their similarly situated, healthy peers. Furthermore, on average, servicemembers with probable PTSD promote slower and separate faster compared to their healthy peers. The study also investigates to what degree depressive symptoms and deploymentrelated injury influence career outcomes compared to PTSD symptoms. Because servicemembers often experience PTSD symptoms in conjunction with other health conditions, the study explores how combinations of these conditions influence time-topromotion and time-to-separation. Results suggest that servicemembers with comorbidities face the most severe career consequences. To address the observed career outcome patterns for servicemembers with probable PTSD, and to mitigate PTSD-related productivity losses, the study recommends an increase in the number of clinical health providers equipped to administer evidencebased treatment.",8

A cross-sectional survey was conducted 1 month after the disaster. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).Clinically relevant PTSD symptoms were observed in 151 (19.7%) community volunteers. Age, education, socioeconomic status, religion, and lifetime experiences of natural disasters were associated with volunteering following the disaster. Logistic regression analysis revealed that volunteering was a significant risk factor for the development of PTSD symptoms in this sample. Personal experience with property damage associated with a traumatic event, depression, and anxiety were also significantly associated with the PTSD symptoms of community volunteers.Our results suggest the need for assessment and mental health programs for community volunteers performing rescue work to prevent posttraumatic stress symptoms following a community disaster.",8

Participants completed the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Self-Rating Scale (PTSD-SS), Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist, Social Support Rate Scale, and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Distinct patterns of PTSD symptom trajectories were established through grouping participants based on time-varying changes of developing PTSD (i.e. reaching the clinical cut-off on the PTSD-SS). Multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine predictors for trajectory membership.PTSD prevalence rates at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months were 21.0, 23.3, 13.5 and 14.7%, respectively. Five PTSD symptom trajectories were observed: resistance (65.3% of the sample), recovery (20.0%), relapsing/remitting (3.3%), delayed dysfunction (4.2%) and chronic dysfunction (7.2%). Female gender and senior grade were related to higher risk of developing PTSD symptoms in at least one time point, whereas being an only child increased the possibility of recovery relative to chronic dysfunction. Family members' injury/loss and witness of traumatic scenes could also cause PTSD chronicity. More negative life events, less social support, more negative coping and less positive coping were also common predictors for not developing resistance or recovery.Adolescents' PTSD symptoms showed an anniversary reaction. Although many adolescents remain euthymic or recover over time, some adolescents, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibit chronic, delayed or relapsing symptoms.

The sample consists of 1029 children and adolescents aged 11–17 years. Of them, 533 (51.8%) were female and 496 (48.2%) were male. War-traumatic events were measured using the War-Traumatic Events Checklist (W-TECh). Violence was derived from the Multicultural Events Schedule for Adolescents (M.E.S.A.) containing three domains: violence at home, violence in the neighbourhood, and violence at school. Emotional and behavioural problems were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder was measured using the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders Symptoms Scale (PTSDSS). Finally, depression symptoms were measured by the Depression scale. Around two thirds of the children (64.5%, N = 665) reported that they were exposed to violence at home, 48.2% (N = 497) to violence in the neighbourhood, 78.2% (N = 806) to violence at school. In addition, boys significantly showed more exposure to violence compared to girls. Moreover, the prevalence of PTSD according to DSM-5 is 53.5% (N = 549). The results also showed that cumulative effect of exposure to violence in more contexts (political war trauma, violence at home, neighbourhood and/or school) predicted higher levels of PTSD, social and emotional problems, depression, and overall mental health problems amongst children. Cumulative exposure to violence may increase the propensity of developing mental health problems such as PTSD, emotional and behavioural problems, and depression symptoms and thus interventions should be targeted to these populations.",9

In the current study, authors examined the prevalence of IPV before and after Hurricane Harvey and the direct and indirect effects of risk (i.e., disaster exposure, IPV) and resilience on mental health outcomes using structural equation modeling with 382 adults. Results indicate that exposure to Hurricane Harvey was significantly associated with risk for IPV, posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms, and depression symptoms. In addition, IPV mediated the relationships between disaster exposure and PTS and depression symptoms. These findings support the need to incorporate IPV services and resources into disaster mental health services.",9

To date, however, scarce research has examined factors associated with perceived need for mental health care, which is critical to promoting engagement in mental health treatment in this population. Data were analyzed from 16,170 WTC responders, including 8881 police responders and 7289 non-traditional responders, who completed their first annual health monitoring visit with the WTC Health Program an average of 6.5 years after September 11, 2001. Predisposing, enabling, and need-based factors associated with perceived need for mental health care were examined using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Nearly half (48.7%) of non-traditional responders and a fifth (20.6%) of police responders reported a need for mental health care. The most common perceived needs were for psychotropic medication, individual psychotherapy, and stress management counseling. Predisposing (e.g., female gender) and need-based factors (e.g., WTC-related posttraumatic stress disorder) predicted perceived need for mental health care in both groups. Among non-traditional responders, Hispanic ethnicity and current suicidal ideation were additionally associated with this outcome. Non-traditional WTC responders are substantially more likely than police WTC responders to perceive a need for mental health treatment. Characterization of factors associated with perceived need for treatment can help inform population-based outreach and monitoring efforts designed to promote engagement in mental health treatment in WTC responders.",9

Data were collected at two time points, approximately 6 months apart.Main Measures: TBI-QOL; PART-OResults: Resilience at baseline was moderately to strongly correlated with baseline psychological distress variables (rs= −.66) and social participation variables (rs =.33 to.57). In regression analyses, resilience was directly associated with social participation outcomes and formed a significant interaction with emotional distress in some models. Resilience failed to show a relationship with social participation at 6-month follow-up, when controlling for baseline social participation.Conclusions: Though related to emotional distress, self-reported resilience makes a unique contribution to predicting outcomes over time following brain injury, and may impact the relationship between stress and negative participation outcomes.

Previous research has suggested that PTSD can be partially explained as a disorder of impaired fear inhibition. The current study utilized a previously validated fear acquisition and extinction paradigm in a sample of 75 undergraduate women who were exposed to a campus mass shooting that occurred in 2008. We used a protocol in which conditioned fear was first acquired through the presentation of one colored shape (reinforced conditioned stimulus, CS+) that was paired with an aversive airblast to the larynx (unconditioned stimulus, US) and a different colored shape that was not paired with the airblast (non-reinforced conditioned stimulus, CS-). Fear was extinguished 10 min later through repeated presentations of the CSs without reinforcement. Number of clinically significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) immediately following the mass shooting were positively associated with fear-potentiated startle (FPS) to the CS+ and CS- during late periods of acquisition. During early periods of fear extinction, PTSS was positively associated with FPS to the CS+. Results from the current study suggest that PTSS is related to altered fear inhibition and extinction during an FPS paradigm. In line with similar research, women with greater PTSS demonstrated a greater ""fear load,"" suggesting that these women experienced elevated fear to the CS+ during extinction after conditioned fear was acquired.",9

Between 2008 and 2012, face-to-face clinical assessments and surveys were conducted using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders was 61%. Alcohol abuse/dependence (44%) and major depressive disorder (23%) were the most common disorders. The majority (64%) of participants reported disorders antedating enlistment. Median age-of-onset varied with anxiety disorders – particularly phobias and OCD – having the earliest (median=15 years) and mood disorders the latest median age-of-onset (median=21 years). The study was limited by both the retrospective investigation of age-of-onset and the location of our sample. As our sample may not represent the general military population, our findings need to be confirmed in additional samples. Each psychiatric disorder exhibited a distinct age-of-onset pattern, such that phobias and OCD onset earliest, substance use disorders onset during a short interval from late-adolescence to early-adulthood, and mood disorders onset the latest. Our finding that the majority of participants reported disorders antedating enlistment suggests that an assessment of lifetime psychopathology is essential to understanding the mental health burden of both current and former military personnel.",9

Adolescents were assessed for character strengths and virtues, political conflict exposure using the Political Life Events (PLE) scale, and psychiatric symptoms using the Brief Symptom Inventory and the UCLA PTSD Index. Results confirmed that political violence exposure was positively correlated with psychiatric symptoms. Interpersonal, temperance and transcendence strengths were negatively associated with psychiatric symptoms. Moderating effects of the interpersonal strengths on the relation between political violence exposure and the psychiatric and PTSD indices were confirmed. The findings extend existing knowledge about the resilience function of character strengths in exposure to protracted conflict and have important practical implications for applying strength-building practices for adolescents who grow up in war-affected environments.",9

Understanding their relationship is of clinical and theoretical importance. A comprehensive way to understand post-trauma psychopathology is through symptom trajectories. This study aims to look at the developmental courses of PTSD and depression symptoms and their interrelationship in the initial months post-trauma in children and adolescents.Two-hundred-and-seventeen children and adolescents aged between eight and 17 exposed to single-event trauma were included in the study. Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and depression symptoms were measured at 2 weeks, 2 months and 9 months, with further psychological variables measured at the 2-week assessment. Group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM) was applied to estimate the latent developmental clusters of the two outcomes. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors associated with high symptom groups.The GBTM yielded a three-group model for PTSS and a three-group model for depression. PTSS trajectories showed symptoms reduced to a non-clinical level by 9 months for all participants (if they were not already in the non-clinical range): participants were observed to be resilient (42.4%) or recovered within 2 months (35.6%), while 21.9% experienced high level PTSS but recovered by 9 months post-trauma. The depression symptom trajectories predicted a chronic non-recovery group (20.1%) and two mild symptom groups (45.9%, 34.0%). Further analysis showed high synchronicity between PTSS and depression groups. Peri-event panic, negative appraisals, rumination and thought suppression at 2 weeks predicted slow recovery from PTSS. Pre-trauma wellbeing, post-trauma anxiety and negative appraisals predicted chronic depression.Post-trauma depression was more persistent than PTSS at 9 months in the sampled population. Cognitive appraisal was the shared risk factor to high symptom groups of both PTSS and depression.Objetivo: El trastorno de estrés postraumático y la depresión tienen una alta comorbilidad. Comprender su relación es de importancia clínica y teórica. Una forma integral de comprender la psicopatología postraumática es a través de las trayectorias de los síntomas. Este estudio tiene como objetivo observar los cursos de desarrollo del TEPT y los síntomas de depresión y su interrelación en los primeros meses posteriores al trauma en niños/ñas y adolescentes.Métodos: Se incluyeron en el estudio 217 niños/ñas y adolescentes de ocho a diecisiete años expuestos a un evento traumático único. Los síntomas de estrés postraumático (SEPT) y los síntomas de depresión se midieron a las 2 semanas, 2 meses y 9 meses, con otras variables psicológicas medidas en la evaluación de 2 semanas. Se aplicó un modelo de trayectoria basado en grupos (MTBG) para estimar los grupos de desarrollo latentes de los dos resultados. Se utilizó la regresión logística para identificar predictores asociados con grupos de síntomas elevados.Resultados: El MTBG arrojó un modelo de tres grupos para SEPT y un modelo de tres grupos para depresión. Las trayectorias de SEPT mostraron síntomas reducidos a un nivel no clínico en 9 meses para todos los participantes (si ellos aún no estaban en el rango no clínico): se observó que los participantes eran resilientes (42,4%) o se recuperaron en 2 meses (35,6%), mientras que el 21,9% experimentó un SEPT de alto nivel pero se recuperó a los 9 meses después del trauma. Las trayectorias de los síntomas de depresión predijeron un grupo crónico de no-recuperación (20,1%) y dos grupos de síntomas leves (45,9%, 34,0%). Un análisis posterior mostró una alta sincronicidad entre los grupos de SEPT y depresión. El pánico peri-evento, las evaluaciones negativas, la rumiación y la supresión del pensamiento a las 2 semanas predijeron una recuperación lenta del SEPT. El bienestar pre-traumático, la ansiedad post-traumática y las valoraciones negativas predijeron la depresión crónica.Conclusiones: La depresión post-traumática fue más persistente que el SEPT a los 9 meses en la población muestreada. La evaluación cognitiva fue el factor de riesgo compartido para los grupos de síntomas altos tanto de SEPT como de depresión.目的: 创伤后应激障碍和抑郁的共病率较高。了解它们的关系具有临床和理论意义。了解创伤后精神病理学的一种综合方法是通过症状轨迹。本研究旨在研究儿童和青少年创伤后最初几个月内 PTSD 和抑郁症状的发展过程及其相互关系。方法: 本研究纳入了 217 名遭受单次创伤的8 至 17 岁儿童和青少年。在 2 周, 2 个月和 9 个月时测量了创伤后应激症状 (PTSS) 和抑郁症状, 并在 2 周评估时测量了进一步的心理变量。应用基于组别的轨迹模型 (GBTM) 来估计两种结果的潜在发展簇。使用逻辑回归来识别与高症状组相关的预测因子。结果: GBTM 产生了 PTSS 三组模型和抑郁三组模型。 PTSS 轨迹显示所有参与者的症状在 9 个月内减少到非临床水平 (如果他们并非已在非临床范围内):观察到参与者有韧性 (42.4%) 或在 2 个月内恢复 (35.6%), 而 21.9% 的人经历了高水平 PTSS, 但在创伤后 9 个月内恢复。抑郁症状轨迹预测慢性非恢复组 (20.1%) 和两个轻度症状组 (45.9%, 34.0%) 。进一步分析显示 PTSS 和抑郁组之间的高度同步性。 2 周时的事件相关恐慌, 负性评价, 反刍和思想抑制预测了 PTSS 恢复缓慢。创伤前的幸福感, 创伤后的焦虑和负性评价预测了慢性抑郁。结论: 在样本人群中, 创伤后抑郁在 9 个月时比 PTSS 更持久。认知评估是 PTSS 和抑郁高症状组的共同风险因素。.",9
https://openalex.org/W3207308387,10.1111/papt.12370,How does early symptom change predict subsequent course of depressive symptoms during psychotherapy?,"Previous studies reported about the influence of early changes on treatment response. However, the question of whether early changes can predict the subsequent course of depressive symptoms during treatment with psychotherapy has not yet been clearly answered. We aimed to investigate whether symptom course in the first weeks at the level of individual session can predict the further symptom progression on a session to session level during psychotherapy treatment in patients with Major Depression (MD).Monocentric randomized controlled trial with psychotherapeutic treatment either with cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) or hypnotherapy (HT). The longitudinal course of weekly depressive symptoms during the six months treatment period was examined.In this RCT with 152 randomized patients suffering from current mild-to-moderate MD, depressive symptoms were assessed on a weekly basis during the 20 sessions' treatment with individual psychotherapy. We only included patients for which sufficient data for our analysis were available. Three different linear and quadratic mixed model analyses with random effects for each patient were tested: Early change was defined as the individual percentage symptom change during the first two, three, four and five weeks. Symptoms from session four, five, six and seven onward were predicted using different models, with early change added to the model in a final step. Calculating all models separately for CBT and HT lead to comparable results.A slow symptom decrease after session four, five, six, seven onward to the end of the treatment was found. However, adding early change to the model, had no effect on the further symptom course in all models.Symptom changes at early stages of psychotherapy should not be considered as being predictive for further symptom course.The individual early symptom change in a treatment with psychotherapy in the first two, three, four, or five weeks of treatment does not predict the subsequent symptom course from session four, five, six, or seven onward at a session to session level. Symptom changes at early stages of psychotherapy should not be considered as being predictive for further symptom course. We found a symptom reduction ranging from 3% to 16% in the first two, three, four, or five weeks. Treatment response between the first and last therapy session was found in 54.5%, the number of remitted patients (with PHQ-9 scores < 5) was 44.7%. A small symptom improvement of between 0.21 and 0.42 points in the PHQ-9 scores per week in later stages of psychotherapy is likely in all patients (with and without early symptom improvement).",10

It is known that increased adjustment difficulties have been found among children following a disaster. Further, community violence exposure has been linked to several areas of negative psychological functioning including PTSD, depression, and anxiety. This study examines the predictive value of level of exposure to the hurricane, level of community violence exposure, and gender, in examining PTSD symptomatology following Hurricane Katrina. Participants were 230 mother-child dyads recruited from various public and private elementary and middle schools within Orleans Parish, Jefferson Parish, and East Baton Rouge Parish 4-7 months post Hurricane Katrina. Children completed the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index, the Hurricane-Related Traumatic Experiences, and the Screen for Adolescent Violence Exposure, in addition to other measures utilized in a larger grant funded research project. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that hurricane exposure and community violence exposure each were significant predictors of PTSD symptoms in children following the hurricane. Gender did not serve as a predictor of PTSD symptoms. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.",10

The World Trade Center Health Registry (Registry) provides a unique opportunity to study the association between PTSD and mortality among a population exposed to the World Trade Center attacks in New York, New York, on September 11, 2001 (9/11).To assess whether 9/11-related probable PTSD (PTSD) is associated with increased mortality risk, as well as whether this association differs when including repeated measures of PTSD over time vs a single baseline assessment.A longitudinal cohort study of 63 666 Registry enrollees (29 270 responders and 34 396 civilians) was conducted from September 5, 2003, to December 31, 2016, with PTSD assessments at baseline (wave 1: 2003-2004) and 3 follow-up time points (wave 2: 2006-2007, wave 3: 2011-2012, wave 4: 2015-2016). Data analyses were conducted from December 4, 2018, to May 20, 2019.Posttraumatic stress disorder was defined using the 17-item PTSD Checklist-Specific (PCL-S) self-report measure (score ≥50) at each wave (waves 1-4). Baseline PTSD was defined using wave 1 PCL-S, and time-varying PTSD was defined using the PCL-S assessments from all 4 waves.Mortality outcomes were ascertained through National Death Index linkage from 2003 to 2016 and defined as all-cause, cardiovascular, and external-cause mortality.Of 63 666 enrollees (38 883 men [61.1%]; mean [SD] age at 9/11, 40.4 [10.4] years), 6689 (10.8%) had PTSD at baseline (responders: 2702 [9.5%]; civilians: 3987 [12.0%]). Participants who were middle aged (2022 [12.5%]), female (3299 [13.8%]), non-Latino black (1295 [17.0%]), or Latino (1835 [22.2%]) were more likely to have PTSD. During follow-up, 2349 enrollees died (including 230 external-cause deaths and 487 cardiovascular deaths). Among all enrollees in time-varying analyses, PTSD was associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, and external-cause mortality, with adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) of greater magnitude compared with analyses examining baseline PTSD. Among responders, time-varying PTSD was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause (AHR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.58-2.32), cardiovascular (AHR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.25-3.04), and external-cause (AHR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.47-3.91) mortality. Among civilians, time-varying PTSD was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause (AHR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.28-1.85), cardiovascular (AHR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.15-2.58), and external-cause (AHR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.06-4.19) mortality.The risk of mortality differed in examination of baseline PTSD vs repeated measures of PTSD over time, suggesting that longitudinal data should be used where possible. Comparable findings between responders and civilians suggest that 9/11-related PTSD is associated with an increased mortality risk.",10

Participants were assessed 4 times: 1 month before deployment, 2–3 months after returning from deployment, 1 year later, and 2 years postdeployment. Growth mixture modeling revealed 3 distinct trajectories: low‐stable symptoms, resilient, 76.4%; new‐onset symptoms, 14.2%; and chronic distress, 9.4%. Relative to the resilient class, membership in both the new‐onset symptoms and chronic distress trajectory classes was predicted by negative emotionality/neuroticism, odds ratios ( OR s) = 1.09, 95% CI [1.02, 1.17], and OR = 1.22, 95% CI [1.09,1.35], respectively; and combat exposure, OR = 1.07, 95% CI [1.02, 1.12], and OR = 1.12, 95% CI [1.02, 1.24], respectively. Membership in the new‐onset trajectory class was predicted by predeployment military preparedness, OR = 0.95, 95% CI [0.91, 0.98], perceived threat during deployment, OR = 1.07, 95% CI [1.03, 1.10], and stressful life events following deployment, OR = 1.44, 95% CI [1.05, 1.96]. Prior deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan, OR = 3.85, 95% CI [1.72, 8.69], predeployment depression, OR = 1.27, 95% CI [1.20, 1.36], and predeployment concerns about a deployment's impact on civilian/family life, OR = 1.09, 95% CI [1.02, 1.16], distinguished the chronic distress group relative to the resilient group.

The aim of this study was to characterize individual differences in the course of HrQoL following SAH using latent growth mixture modelling (LGMM).A longitudinal study with 113 incident cases of aneurysmal SAH was performed in order to evaluate clinical outcome (Hunt and Hess scale, Barthel-Index, Beck Depression Inventory) and HrQoL data (EQ-5D) at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The heterogeneity in HrQoL courses after SAH was analysed using LGMM.Four subgroups (classes) of different patterns of HrQoL course after SAH were identified. Two of these classes (1 and 3) comprised patients with considerably reduced initial HrQoL, which was associated with more severe symptoms of SAH. Class 1 showing the worst EQ5D-index values during the entire study period. Class 3 experiencing a considerable improvement in HrQoL values. In comparison to classes 1 and 3, class 2 and 4 were characterized by less severe SAH and better functional outcome. An important difference in the disease course between classes 2 and 4 was a temporary increase in depression scores at the 6-month time point in class 4, which was associated with a considerable reduction in HrQoL.The specific clinical parameters characterizing differences between classes, such as severity of SAH, functional outcome, cognitive impairment and post-stroke depression, were identified and the influence of their potential improvement on HrQoL was estimated.By means of LGMM we could classify the course of HrQoL after SAH in four different patterns, which are relevant for the clinical decisions. Clinical parameters, which can be modified in order to improve the course of HrQoL were identified and could help to develop individual therapeutic strategies for the rehabilitation after SAH.",10

The purpose of this study was to develop an admission scoring system that assesses the risk of development of depression or posttraumatic symptoms in the burn population. This study is a retrospective review of the prospectively collected Burn Model System National Database. Adult burn survivors enrolled from 2014 to 2018 (n = 486) were included. The primary outcome was the presence of DPTS symptoms at 6, 12, or 24 months postinjury. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify demographic and clinical predictors of DPTS symptoms. A risk scoring system was then created based on assigning point values to relevant predictor factors. The study population had a mean age of 46.5 ± 15.8 years, mean burn size of 18.3 ± 19.7%, and was 68.3% male. Prior to injury, 71.3% of the population was working, 47.9% were married, and 50.8% had completed more than a high school education. An 8-point risk scoring system was developed using the following predictors of DPTS symptom development: gender, psychiatric treatment in the past year, graft size, head/neck graft, etiology of injury, and education level. This study is the first to develop a DPTS symptom risk scoring system for burn injury. This scoring system will aid in identifying burn survivors at high risk of long-term psychiatric symptoms that may be used to improve screening, monitoring, timely diagnosis, and interventions.",10

This study examines the extent of DSM-IV PTSD 11–13 years after the disaster in WTC responders, its symptom profiles and trajectories, and associations of active, remitted and partial PTSD with exposures, physical health and psychosocial well-being. Method Master's-level psychologists administered sections of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Range of Impaired Functioning Tool to 3231 responders monitored at the Stony Brook University World Trade Center Health Program. The PTSD Checklist (PCL) and current medical symptoms were obtained at each visit. Results In all, 9.7% had current, 7.9% remitted, and 5.9% partial WTC-PTSD. Among those with active PTSD, avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms were most commonly, and flashbacks least commonly, reported. Trajectories of symptom severity across monitoring visits showed a modestly increasing slope for active and decelerating slope for remitted PTSD. WTC exposures, especially death and human remains, were strongly associated with PTSD. After adjusting for exposure and critical risk factors, including hazardous drinking and co-morbid depression, PTSD was strongly associated with health and well-being, especially dissatisfaction with life. Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate the extent and correlates of long-term DSM-IV PTSD among responders. Although most proved resilient, there remains a sizable subgroup in need of continued treatment in the second decade after 9/11.",11

This study utilizes data from three cohort studies of Hurricane Katrina survivors—including low-income mothers from New Orleans; displaced and highly impacted families from Louisiana and Mississippi; and Vietnamese immigrants in New Orleans—to examine the relationship between cumulative natural disaster exposure and adolescent psychological distress approximately 13 years after Katrina. Among 648 respondents with children ages 10-17, 112 (17.2%) reported that their child had exhibited one or more symptoms of psychological distress in the past month. Overall, respondents had experienced an average of 0.6 (SD 1.0) natural disasters following Hurricane Katrina. Each additional natural disaster experienced by the respondent was associated with 1.41 (95% CI 1.05, 1.88) greater odds of his or child experiencing psychological distress in the past month. This relationship was not significantly moderated by any measures of family resilience or vulnerability, nor by race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status, although family functioning, parental coping, and caregiver mental health were independently associated with adolescent psychological distress. The results of this analysis suggest that natural disasters have cumulative, detrimental impacts on adolescent mental health.",11

Temporal Disintegration, Distress, and Fear of the Future Following Collective Trauma","Trauma survivors often report experiencing temporal disintegration (e.g., time slowing down, the present feeling disconnected from the past and future) during and after trauma, yet how these distorted time perceptions relate to psychological adjustment and views of the future is poorly understood. We examined the relationships between prior adversity, temporal disintegration, distress, and fear of future trauma following two collective traumas: cross-sectionally among college students following a university-based active shooter event and longitudinally using data from a national sample following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Temporal disintegration was significantly associated with elevated distress, which was related to greater fear of future trauma. Individuals who experienced prior adversity were especially likely to report temporal disintegration following collective trauma, suggesting that prior adversity may render individuals vulnerable to subsequent deleterious response patterns. Trauma-related temporal disintegration may have lasting implications for psychological adjustment and for how people perceive their futures, especially among individuals with a history of adversity.",11

Police officers were assessed between 5 and 15 days, and at 1 month, 3 months, and 12 months after the event. They also completed self-administered questionnaires assessing several potential predictors. Predictive analyses about the onset of PTSD were based on a 4-step nested random-effect linear regression. Overall, results showed that the modulation of PTSD symptomatology was associated with some pretraumatic (i.e., emotional coping strategies and number of children), peritraumatic (i.e., physical and emotional reactions and dissociation), and posttraumatic factors (i.e., ASD, depression symptoms, and seeking psychological help at the employee assistance program and at the police union between the event and Time 1).

Participants completed a battery of measures including cognitive tests; questionnaires assessing self-report of emotional symptoms, perceived social support, and coping style; and a measure of resilience.Approximately 60% of the sample endorsed moderate to high levels of resilience during the first 5 years postinjury. Brain injury severity, premorbid intelligence, and cognitive flexibility did not predict resilience, as measured by the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. By contrast, task-oriented coping and perceived social support were strong and unique covariates of resilience. Positive and negative affectivity were related to resilience but were not unique covariates of it in the presence of task-oriented coping and perceived social support. Discriminant validity of resilience as a concept and the means of assessing it was supported by findings that emotion-oriented and avoidance coping were not meaningfully related to resilience.Overall, the findings indicate that the majority of individuals in this sample reported high levels of resilience after brain injury and that correlates of resilience in adults with TBI is similar to that observed in adults without the history of cognitive impairment.

Identifying risk for post-treatment worsening of symptoms using latent trajectories of change in eating disorder (ED) symptoms during treatment could allow for personalization of treatment to improve long-term outcomes METHODS: Participants (N = 56) with BN-spectrum EDs received 16 sessions of CBT and completed digital self-monitoring of eating episodes and ED behaviors. The Eating Disorder Examination was used to measured ED symptoms at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Latent growth mixture modeling of digital self-monitoring data identified latent growth classes. Kruskal-Wallis H tests examined effect of trajectory of change in ED symptoms on post-treatment to follow-up symptom change.Multi-class models of change in binge eating, compensatory behaviors, and regular eating improved fit over one-class models. Individuals with high frequency-rapid response in binge eating (H(1) = 10.68, p =0 .001, η2 = 0.24) had greater recurrence of compensatory behaviors compared to individuals with low frequency-static response. Individuals with static change in regular eating exhibited greater recurrence of binge eating than individuals with moderate response (H(1) = 8.99, p = 0.003, η2 = 0.20).Trajectories of change in ED symptoms predict post-treatment worsening of symptoms.

Potential Implications of Populism for Refugee Mental Health,"After relocation, refugees may experience significant difficulty adjusting to a host culture, and this difficulty may persist even after many years following resettlement. However, the influence of time on postmigration living difficulties (PMLD) and psychological distress has not been extensively investigated. In this investigation, we used regression analyses to examine whether length of residence in the United States would moderate the relationship between psychological symptoms and PMLD in a sample of 52 adult East African refugees. The sample was predominantly male (female n = 13) with a mean age of ∼37 years ( SD = 20.91) and mean length of residence in the United States of 9.9 years ( SD = 5.85). The moderating effect of years living in the United States on the depression–PMLD relationship was significant, and explained an additional 9% of variance in PMLD. The relationship between depressive symptoms and PMLD became significantly related at ∼7 years of residence in the United States, and became more positive as values in the sample approached the longest duration in the United States (30 years). No such moderating effect was found for the association between posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and PMLD. These results highlight the risk of marginalization as well as the need for early and sustained psychosocial interventions for refugee populations in the United States.",11

However, few prospective studies have evaluated whether anxiety sensitivity predicts PTSS. In a subsample of 48 women sexual assault survivors enrolled as part of a larger prospective observational study, elevated anxiety sensitivity measured via a brief assessment 1 week after experiencing a sexual assault was concurrently associated with PTSS at 1 week and prospectively predicted PTSS 6 weeks after the event, with small-to-medium effect sizes, η2p = .10, even after covarying for trauma history. Heightened anxiety sensitivity at 1-week postevent also interacted with time to predict anxiety and depression both before and after sexual assault, with medium-to-large effect sizes, ηp2 = .21- .24. This is consistent with research linking anxiety sensitivity to PTSS, but this was the first prospective study of which we are aware to demonstrate that anxiety sensitivity in the acute posttrauma period predicts PTSS among women who have recently experienced sexual assault. Future research should use the full Anxiety Sensitivity Index to replicate findings in a larger sample and explore whether targeting anxiety sensitivity could mitigate the development of PTSS in this vulnerable population.",11

Although studies have documented a wide range of detrimental emotional and behavioral effects of such exposure, much less is known about the effects of exposure to a continuous security threat for children and adolescents. Against this background, the current article examined the implications of continuous exposure to missile attacks among 1096 children and adolescents enrolled in public schools near the Israeli border with Gaza. Participants filled out quantitative questionnaires, which relate to the pathological consequences of continuous exposure to security threats, and to the role of the school and the community as a protective environment against disruptive behavior resulting from such exposure. The findings revealed that PTSS responses were mainly related to the security threat, whereas interpersonal aggression resulted from other types of traumatic events. Significant differences were found between aggression and posttraumatic symptoms, by age and gender. PTSS was found to be lower for older participants and higher for girls, whereas aggression was higher for boys and higher for older participants. Furthermore, the sense of belonging to the place of residence was negatively associated with PTSS as well as with aggressive behavior: the higher the participants' sense of belonging, the lower their levels of PTSS and aggressive responses. In contrast, the sense of belonging to the school was negatively associated only with aggressive behavior: the higher the participants' sense of belonging to the school, the lower their aggressive responses. The findings are discussed in the light of trauma theories and in light of the results of previous research. The study contributed to knowledge about the differential consequences of exposure to a security threat, and highlighted the importance of differential interventions with children who show post-traumatic symptoms versus those who show aggressive behavior. Accordingly, the security situation should not overshadow social issues that need to be addressed, such as family violence and aggression among school children.",11

Military deployment can put soldiers at increased risk for developing PTSD symptoms. Longitudinal evaluations of PTSD symptoms in deployed military personnel are essential for mapping the long-term psychological burden of recent operations on our service members, and may improve current practice in veterans’ mental health care. Methods The current study examined PTSD symptoms and associated risk factors in a cohort of Dutch Afghanistan veterans 10 years after homecoming. Participants ( N = 963) were assessed seven times from predeployment up to 10 years after deployment. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify distinct trajectories of PTSD symptom development. Results The probable PTSD prevalence at 10 years after deployment was 8%. Previously identified risk factors like younger age, lower rank, more deployment stressors, and less social support were still relevant 10 years after deployment. Four trajectories of PTSD symptom development were identified: resilient (85%), improved (6%), severely elevated-recovering (2%), and delayed onset (7%). Only the delayed onset group reported increasing symptom levels between 5 and 10 years postdeployment, even though 77% reported seeking help. Conclusions This study provides insights into the long-term burden of deployment on the psychological health of military service members. It identifies a group of veterans with further increasing PTSD symptoms that does not seem to improve from currently available mental health support, and underlines the urgent need for developing and implementing alternative treatment opportunities for this group.",11

While existing literature has established an association between disability onset and elevated rates of depression, resilience and alternative patterns of adjustment have received substantially less empirical inquiry. The current study sought to model heterogeneity in mental health responding to disability onset in later life while exploring the impact of socioeconomic resources on these latent patterns of adaptation.Latent growth mixture modeling was utilized to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms surrounding physical disability onset in a population sample of older adults. Individuals with verified disability onset (n = 3,204) were followed across four measurement points representing a 6-year period.Four trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified: resilience (56.5%), emerging depression (17.2%), remitting depression (13.4%), and chronic depression (12.9%). Socioeconomic resources were then analyzed as predictors of trajectory membership. Prior education and financial assets at the time of disability onset robustly predicted class membership in the resilient class compared to all other classes.The course of adjustment in response to disability onset is heterogeneous. Our results confirm the presence of multiple pathways of adjustment surrounding late-life disability, with the most common outcome being near-zero depressive symptoms for the duration of the study. Socioeconomic resources strongly predicted membership in the resilient class compared with all other classes, indicating that such resources may play a protective role during the stress of physical disability onset.

One year after the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, this study assessed perceived resilience, relations between resiliency and psychological symptoms, and the degree to which self-reported resiliency was associated with reduced psychological symptoms after accounting for differences in economic impact sustained by Gulf Coast residents. Participants were 812 adults (64% women, mean age 50) of 2 Alabama coastal communities. Participants were administered a telephone survey 1-year post-spill assessing self-perceptions of impact factors (e.g., economic and social), resilience, coping, and depressive and PTSD symptoms. Most participants perceived themselves as resilient (n = 739). As expected, lower perceived resilience was associated with greater ongoing depressive and PTSD symptoms. Spill-related economic impact predicted greater depressive and PTSD symptoms; however, perceived resilience predicted significant variance in psychological symptoms after taking into account spill-related economic impact. Improving individuals' sense of resiliency may help mitigate psychosocial and mental health effects over time.",12

Posttraumatic stress disorder is one of the most important impacts related to these events, but also a relatively under‐researched topic outside original psychopathological contexts. We conduct a survey to investigate the mental stress caused by floods. We focus on hydrological, individual, and collective drivers of posttraumatic stress. We assess stress with flood‐specific health scores and the GHQ‐12 General Health Questionnaire. Our findings show that the combination of water depth and flood velocity measured via a Hazard Class Index is an important stressor; and that mental health resilience can be significantly improved by providing the population with adequate information. More specifically, the paper shows that psychological distress can be reduced by (i) coordinating awareness of flood risks and flood protection and prevention behavior; (ii) developing the ability to protect oneself from physical, material and intangible damage; (iii) designing simple insurance procedures and protocols for fast recovery; and (iv) learning from previous experiences.",12

A stratification random sample survey was conducted to collect data in the Longmenshan thrust fault after Lushan earthquake three years. We used the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13) and the Earthquake Experience Scale. Subjects in this study included 3944 school student survivors in local eleven schools. The prevalence of probable PTSD is relatively higher, when the people was trapped in the earthquake, was injured in the earthquake or have relatives who died in the earthquake. It concluded that researchers need to pay more attention to the children and adolescents. The government should pay more attention to these people and provide more economic support.",12

This study is a secondary analysis of previously identified family system types that are based on attachment, parenting, and siblingship, and of the influence they have on the effectiveness of teaching recovery techniques (TRT). TRT is a psychosocial group intervention aimed at reducing children's mental health problems and increasing their psychosocial resources. We tested three hypotheses. First was the compensation hypothesis, which holds that children from families with negative relationships benefit a great deal from the TRT intervention. The second was the accumulative hypothesis, which maintains that children from families with negative relationships do not benefit from the intervention. The third, the buffering hypothesis, states that children from families with positive relationships benefit a great deal from the intervention. The family sample consists of 325 Palestinian mothers and fathers and one of their children (age 10–13). Children participated either in the TRT intervention or waiting-list control groups. Their self-reported post-traumatic stress symptoms, emotional and conduct problems, positive resources, and prosocial behavior were assessed at baseline, three months post-intervention, and at a six-month follow-up. We found that family type was significantly associated with TRT effectiveness, which supports the compensation and buffering hypotheses. Children with insecure and negative family relationships and those from families with discrepant perceptions of relationship quality showed a decline in emotional problems across the three assessments, and an increase in positive resources. Children from families with highly secure, positive relationships and those with moderately secure, neutral relationships showed increased positive resources and prosocial behavior in the control group as well. We argue that a family system approach can deepen understanding of the mechanisms of successful psychosocial interventions and, therefore, that family relations should be taken into account when tailoring such interventions for traumatized children.",12

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of adjustment disorder in the first 12 months after severe injury; to determine whether adjustment disorder was a less severe disorder compared with other disorders in terms of disability and quality of life; to investigate the trajectory of adjustment disorder; and to examine whether the subtypes described in DSM-5 are distinguishable.In a multisite, cohort study, injury patients were assessed during hospitalization and at 3 and 12 months postinjury (N=826). Structured clinical interviews were used to assess affective, anxiety, and substance use disorders, and self-report measures of disability, anxiety, depression, and quality of life were administered.The prevalence of adjustment disorder was 19% at 3 months and 16% at 12 months. Participants with adjustment disorder reported worse outcomes relative to those with no psychiatric diagnosis but better outcomes compared with those diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders. Participants with adjustment disorder at 3 months postinjury were significantly more likely to meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder at 12 months (odds ratio=2.67, 95% CI=1.59-4.49). Latent-profile analysis identified a three-class model that was based on symptom severity, not the subtypes identified by DSM-5.Recategorization of adjustment disorder into the trauma- and stressor-related disorders is supported by this study.

Following the 9/11/2001 World Trade Center (WTC) attacks, thousands of individuals were involved in rescue, recovery and clean-up efforts. While a growing body of literature has documented the prevalence and correlates of PTSD in WTC responders, no study has evaluated predominant typologies of PTSD in this population. Participants were 4352 WTC responders with probable WTC-related DSM-IV PTSD. Latent class analyses were conducted to identify predominant typologies of PTSD symptoms and associated correlates. A 3-class solution provided the optimal representation of latent PTSD symptom typologies. The first class, labeled “High-Symptom (n = 1,973, 45.3%),” was characterized by high probabilities of all PTSD symptoms. The second class, “Dysphoric (n = 1,371, 31.5%),” exhibited relatively high probabilities of emotional numbing and dysphoric arousal (e.g., sleep disturbance). The third class, “Threat (n = 1,008, 23.2%),” was characterized by high probabilities of re-experiencing, avoidance and anxious arousal (e.g., hypervigilance). Compared to the Threat class, the Dysphoric class reported a greater number of life stressors after 9/11/2001 (OR = 1.06). The High-Symptom class was more likely than the Threat class to have a positive psychiatric history before 9/11/2001 (OR = 1.7) and reported a greater number of life stressors after 9/11/2001 (OR = 1.1). The High-Symptom class was more likely than the Dysphoric class, which was more likely than the Threat class, to screen positive for depression (83% > 74% > 53%, respectively), and to report greater functional impairment (High-Symptom > Dysphoric [Cohen d = 0.19], Dysphoric > Threat [Cohen d = 0.24]). These results may help inform assessment, risk stratification, and treatment approaches for PTSD in WTC and disaster responders.",12

A pilot study of young Iraqi war survivors living in Turkey,"Positive personal gain after adverse life events and traumas is known as posttraumatic growth (PTG). Several factors are suggested to promote PTG after stressful events, including type of trauma, in addition to younger age and female gender. Although conflicting findings exist, studies suggest that there may be less growth associated with personal traumas (i.e., physical or sexual assault, accidents) and more growth associated with shared traumas (i.e., disasters, loss). We examined whether certain types of war-related traumas are associated with more PTG in a sample of 203 Iraqi students living in Turkey who had experienced severe war-related traumatic events. They were assessed in group sessions, using a self-report battery that included the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory and War Trauma Questionnaire. War experiences were categorized into three types of trauma: trauma to self, trauma to loved ones, and adversity. Growth was measured by the Turkish version of the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory. Adversity-type events positively predicted growth, whereas trauma to self predicted growth negatively. Males and females showed a different pattern of relationship with growth. Correlations of growth with younger age and adversity observed in females were not seen in males. Our results show that different trauma types may lead to differing levels of growth, and this difference may be more pronounced when gender is taken into account.",12

The course of depression symptoms varies over time and across individuals; several factors including combat exposure influence depressions incidence and course. Importantly, previous trauma, especially in childhood, have been found increase the risk of post-deployment depression. In a prospective sample of 530 soldiers deployed to Afghanistan in 2009, we used latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) to estimate trajectories of depression symptoms from before through 6.5 years after deployment. In a multinomial logistic regression model, we tested if childhood and adult life trauma predicted trajectory membership in combination with combat exposure and neuroticism. We identified a large trajectory of few depression symptoms from before through 6.5 years after deployment (Low-stable, 86.5%), a trajectory with somewhat elevated symptoms (Medium-fluctuating, 4.0%), and a trajectory with few symptoms before deployment and a steep increase to a severe symptom level 6.5 years after deployment (Low-increasing, 9.4%). The Low-increasing trajectory was predicted by lower rank and childhood trauma, while the Medium-fluctuating trajectory was predicted by neuroticism, adult life trauma, and post-deployment PTSD symptoms. Attrition and use of self-report measures for depression and trauma. Depression symptoms follow a heterogeneous course from before through 6.5 years after deployment with 9.4% experiencing symptom increase, resulting in severe symptoms 6.5 years after deployment. Trajectories are differentially predicted by rank, childhood and adult life trauma as well as neuroticism and PTSD symptoms, illustrating the clinical importance of taking individual differences of symptom course into account.",12

Parents completed questionnaires about their mental health and psychosocial stressors within 4 weeks of the child's illness/injury (T1), and 4 months (T2), 7 months (T3), and 19 months (T4) postdiagnosis. Results For both mothers and fathers, mental health symptoms were elevated at diagnosis declining to normal levels by T3, with a pattern of increase at T4. Fathers demonstrated a faster decline in symptoms between T1 and T2, and fathers, but not mothers, experienced a relapse in depressive symptoms at T4. Fathers reported higher rates of work changes. Conclusions These findings have important implications for the design and timing of parental interventions to support families of children with life‐threatening disease/injury.",13

This study assessed the impact of dissociation and peritraumatic distress on the severity of PTSD and post-traumatic major depressive episode (MDE) symptoms in mothers during the first years after the MVC and the role that cortisol response might play in this association.Methods: 125 mothers were included. Peritraumatic distress and dissociation were assessed. Morning salivary cortisol was tested at the baseline. Participants were assessed for a probable diagnosis of PTSD and MDE at 5 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.Results: At 5 weeks, 12 (13.6%) mothers exhibited probable PTSD. During the first year, the PCL score was higher when the (i) Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI) score increased and (ii) the Peritraumatic Dissociation Experience Questionnaire (PDEQ) score increased. Cortisol levels were lower when the PDI score increased.Conclusion: This is the first study to assess the mothers of MVC survivors for one year following the trauma. We confirm that peritraumatic responses are useful for predicting the severity of PTSD symptoms. These results could encourage the implementation of follow-up programmes not only for survivors but also for their mothers.HIGHLIGHTS Mothers of children involved in motor vehicle accident are at risk for developing PTSD.Peritraumatic responses (distress and dissociation) are associated to the severity of PTSD symptoms.Low salivary cortisol levels were associated with high peritraumatic distress.",13

We proposed pre-exposure treatment composed of psychoeducation, emotion identification and regulation training, cognitive modification training, dissociation management training and meta-dissociative and meta-emotional restructuring. Then, we proposed an exposure therapy and pursued the training skills during the second part of the therapy. We observed significant improvement after the therapy. We found reduction of dissociation during the first part of the therapy while intrusions remained constant. We observed a reduction of intrusive symptoms during the second part of the therapy. Patients suffering from d-PTSD may benefit from adjusted CBT. The use of emotion regulation and dissociation management training should be develop before undertaking exposure therapy.",13

This has resulted in greater demand for rehabilitation services. One of the major goals for rehabilitation programmes is to restore these clients to their pre-trauma activity levels. However, there is not much research on the subject.Methods: Based on their availability, 30 clients with severe burns were selected, who had been discharged from the hospital for periods ranging from 1 month to 1 year. Interviews were conducted and the participants’ perceptions were recorded regarding changes in their self-care, household chores, professional work, hobbies and recreational activities. Based on the results, 2 independent assessors categorised the activity levels as none, minor, intermediate and severe, in terms of negative effect.Results: In the self-care category, 8 participants reported no negative effect, 12 reported minor, 4 reported intermediate and 6 reported severe effects. In the household chores category, only 2 clients reported no effect and 13 indicated severe effects on their activities. Of the 21 participants who were working, only 2 reported no change in pre-trauma activities while 11 reported severe changes in their working activity levels. While 5 participants indicated no change in their recreational and leisure activity levels, 6 reported severe changes.Conclusion: Severe burns reduce clients’ levels of activity in some of the categories. However, they often regain their ability to perform activities at a lower level, depending on the site of burn, burning agent, and having received early rehabilitation pre- and post-discharge. Psycho-social factors, pre- and post- trauma, are also important.",13

Life satisfaction is a main factor in the general construct of subjective well-being. However, there is limited literature available on the interrelationship between emotional outcomes and life satisfaction post–severe TBI over time. The purpose of this study was to characterize distinct patterns of change in depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction over 24 months after severe TBI and evaluate the interrelationship of different trajectory groups among them as well as associated subject characteristics. Methods: This prospective study used longitudinal data collected from the University of Pittsburgh Brain Trauma Research Center from survivors of severe TBI ( N = 129). In addition to demographic and injury-related data, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction were collected at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postinjury. A group-based trajectory model was performed to identify distinct longitudinal patterns of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction. The interrelationships of distinct trajectory groups were examined using χ 2 tests. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine the predictors of different emotional symptom trajectories. Results: The group-based trajectory model identified 2 distinct patterns of each of 3 outcomes: constantly low and constantly high depressive symptoms group (70.4% vs 29.6%), constantly low and constantly high anxiety group (69.1% vs 30.9%), and low-decreasing and high-stable life satisfaction groups (56.3% vs 43.7%). A strong pairwise association was observed between trajectory group membership for depressive symptoms and anxiety ( P &lt; .0001), depressive symptoms and life satisfaction ( P &lt; .0001), and anxiety and life satisfaction ( P &lt; .001). Subjects with increased severe injury were more likely to belong to the high-stable depressive symptoms group, while there were no significant associations between age, gender, race, education, marriage status and distinct depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction trajectory groups. Conclusions: A group-based trajectory model revealed patterns of emotional symptoms that have not been fully explored among survivors of severe TBI. There appear to be distinct trajectory patterns for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction, respectively. There was strong interrelationship among emotional symptoms. The findings add to our understanding of psychosocial outcomes experienced over time after severe TBI.",13

Yet, the degree to which deployment-related stressors, in combination with preexisting and co-occurring psychiatric symptoms and individual resilience factors, contribute to suicide ideation (SI) remains unclear. The current study leverages prospective, longitudinal data to examine both risk and protective factors associated with SI in deployed service members. Materials and Methods Participants were 1,805 active duty enlisted Marines and Navy service members assessed before and after a 7-month deployment for SI, preexisting and concurrent symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol consumption, as well as prior and deployment-related traumatic brain injury (TBI). Current self-reported psychological resilience and social support were analyzed as potential protective factors. Results Rates of SI were 7.3% and 3.9% before and after deployment, respectively. Of those with post-deployment SI, 68.6% were new-onset cases. Multivariate regression revealed that concurrent mild depression was the strongest risk factor (odds ratio [OR] = 10.03, 95% CI 5.28-19.07). Other significant risk factors included prior SI (OR = 3.36, 95% CI 1.60-7.05), prior subthreshold PTSD (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.10-3.99), and deployment TBI (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.03-3.28). Controlling for clinical symptoms and TBI, the risk of SI was reduced for those with moderate (OR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.93) and high psychological resilience scores (OR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.79) after deployment. Conclusions Results indicate that even mild symptoms of depression and PTSD may increase the risk of SI. Screening for subthreshold clinical symptoms and TBI while incorporating psychological resilience training would allow for a more multidimensional approach to suicide risk assessment.",13

The study began in late December 2003 and recruitment continued until early 2007. Ages ranged from 14 to 90 years, with a mean of 35.96 years (SD = 16.61). The study also examined the associations between the groups and causes of TBI. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale within 3 weeks of injury, and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-injury. The results revealed three groups: low, high, and delayed depression. In the low group depression scores remained below the clinical cut-off at all assessment points during the 24-months post-TBI, and in the high group, depression scores were above the clinical cut-off at all assessment points. The delayed group showed an increase in depression symptoms to 12 months after injury, followed by a return to initial assessment level during the following 12 months. Covariates were found to be differentially associated with the three groups. For example, relative to the low group, the high depression group was associated with more severe TBI, being female, and a shorter period of hospitalization. The delayed group also had a shorter period of hospitalization, were younger, and sustained less severe TBI. Our findings show considerable fluctuation of depression over time, and that a non-clinical level of depression at any one point in time does not necessarily mean that the person will continue to have non-clinical levels in the future. As we used GMM, we were able to show new findings and also bring clarity to contradictory past findings on depression and TBI. Consequently, we recommend the use of this approach in future studies in this area.",13

However, most research on this field has focused on self-reported resilience, and other patterns of response when facing adversity, in cross-sectional designs.Objective: Alternatively, we aimed to study changing patterns of psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population, based on patterns of symptoms, and factors contributing to those patterns.Method: A national representative sample of Spain (N = 1,628) responded to an internet-based survey at two assessment points, separated by 1 month (April and May 2020), during the official national confinement stage. Based upon whether participants exhibited absence/presence of distress (i.e., significant trauma-related, depression, or anxiety symptoms) at one or two of the assessment times, patterns of psychological responses were defined by categorizing individuals into one of the four categories: Resilience, Delayed distress, Recovered, and Sustained distress.Results: Analyses of the levels of disturbance associated with the symptoms provided support to that four-fold distinction of patterns of responses. Furthermore, resilience responses were the most common psychological response to the pandemic. Multinomial regression analyses revealed that the main variables increasing the probability of resilience to COVID-19 were being male, older, having no history of mental health difficulties, higher levels of psychological well-being and high identification with all humanity. Also, having low scores in several variables (i.e., anxiety and economic threat due to COVID-19, substance use during the confinement, intolerance to uncertainty, death anxiety, loneliness, and suspiciousness) was a significant predictor of a resilient response to COVID-19.Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with previous literature that conceptualizes resilience as a dynamic process. The clinical implications of significant predictors of the resilience and the rest of psychological patterns of response are discussed.",13

Police officers are also exposed to traumatic events and the development of PTSD. The main aim of the cross-sectional study was to determine the mediating role played by rumination in the relationship between burnout and PTSD among police officers. It also examines whether burnout is a significant prognostic factor for PTSD symptoms. Methods Data were obtained from a sample of 120 police officers. Of these one hundred, mostly men (83%), aged 23–47 years ( M = 33.06, SD = 5.61), confirmed the experience of traumatic events in connection with their professional work. Three standard measuring tools were used: The Posttraumatic Checklist for DSM-5, The Oldenburg Burnout Inventory OBI, and The Event-Related Rumination Inventory. Results The introduction of intrusive ruminating as an intermediary variable made the relationship between job burnout and PTSD non-significant, which indicates full mediation. The introduction of deliberate rumination as a mediator weakens the relationship between burnout and PTSD, which indicates partial mediation. It indicates that police officers who are burnout and who additionally tend to ruminate about experienced traumatic events are more likely to PTSD than police officers who are only burned out. Conclusion Intervention programs for police officers should focus on strengthening stress management resources in the form of developing deliberate ruminations, thus allowing the experienced situations to be given a new meaning and to allow better coping.",13

Using data collected prospectively at three distinct assessments during 2003–2014 as part of the Neurocognition Deployment Health Study and VA Cooperative Studies Program Study #566, we explored how stress exposures prior, during, and after return from deployment influence the long-term mental health outcomes of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety disorders, and problem drinking. Longer-term mental health outcomes were assessed in 375 service members and military veterans an average of 7.5 years (standard deviation = 1.0 year) after the initial (i.e., “index”) Iraq deployment following their predeployment assessment. Anxiety disorder was the most commonly observed long-term mental health outcome (36.0%), followed by depression (24.5%), PTSD (24.3%), and problem drinking (21.0%). Multivariable regression models showed that greater postdeployment stressors, as measured by the Post-Deployment Life Events scale, were associated with greater risk of depression, anxiety disorders, and problem drinking. Anxiety disorder was the only outcome affected by predeployment stress concerns. In addition, greater postdeployment social support was associated with lower risk of all outcomes except problem drinking. These findings highlight the importance of assessing postdeployment stress exposures, such as stressful or traumatic life events, given the potential impact of these stressors on long-term mental health outcomes. This study also highlights the importance of postdeployment social support as a modifiable protective factor that can be used to help mitigate risk of long-term adverse mental health outcomes following war-zone exposure.",13

Participants were 18,896 WTC responders, including 8466 police officers and 10,430 non-traditional responders (85.8% male; 86.4% Caucasian; Mage = 39.5, SD = 8.8) participating in the WTC Health Program who completed an initial examination between July, 2002 and April, 2010 and who were reassessed, on average, 2.5 years later. Path analyses were conducted to evaluate contributions of life events to the maintenance of WTC-related posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and overall functioning. These analyses were stratified by police and non-traditional responder groups and adjusted for age, sex, time from 9/11 to initial visit, WTC exposures (three WTC contextual exposures: co-worker, friend, or a relative died in the disaster; co-worker, friend, or a relative injured in the disaster; and responder was exposed to the dust cloud on 9/11), and interval from initial to first follow-up visit. In both groups, WTC-related posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and overall functioning were stable over the follow-up period. WTC exposures were related to these three outcomes at the initial assessment. WTC-related posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and overall functioning, at the initial assessment each predicted the occurrence of post-disaster stressful life events, as measured by Disaster Supplement of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Post-disaster stressful life events, in turn, were associated with subsequent mental health, indicating partial mediation of the stability of observed mental health. The present findings suggest a dynamic interplay between exposure, post-disaster stressful life events, and WTC-related posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and overall functioning among WTC disaster responders.",13

It is important to determine for whom these treatments work and to examine predictors of success. Method An 8-week modified prolonged exposure (PE) treatment, including components of behavioral activation and reducing the number of imaginal exposure sessions, was administered to a sample of 231 Veterans (mean age = 45.7 years, standard deviation = 14.89). Growth mixture modeling was used to model PTSD symptom trajectories across the 8-week intervention and a postintervention appointment. Further, baseline demographics, social support, clinician-rated PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and depression were examined as predictors of trajectories. Results Three classes emerged, labeled responders (n = 35), nonresponders (n = 190), and immediate responders (n = 6). The only significant baseline difference between responders and nonresponders was higher anxiety symptoms in the nonresponders. At follow-up time points, there were higher levels of clinician-rated PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms and lower social support in the nonresponders compared to the responders. Conclusion Findings suggest that modifying standard PE treatments by reducing imaginal exposure sessions while adding behavioral activation may not be advisable for most Veterans with PTSD.",13

Risk and protective factors for depression trajectories, as well as associations with child outcomes were analyzed.This study included 283 mothers (age at time 1, M = 39.20 years, SD = 7.21; 62% African American). Mothers were assessed at four time points over two years following Hurricane Katrina. Mothers reported posttraumatic stress symptoms, hurricane exposure, traumatic life events, and social support at time 1. Depressive symptoms were modeled at times 2, 3, and 4. Youth reported their distress symptoms (posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety) at time 4.Latent class growth analyses identified three maternal depression trajectories among mothers exposed to Hurricane Katrina: low (61%), resilient (29%), and chronic (10%). Social support was identified as a protective factor among mothers.Three main trajectories of maternal depression following Hurricane Katrina were identified. Social support was protective for mothers. Identified trajectories were not associated with children's distress outcomes. These results have implications for disaster responses, screening efforts, and interventions targeted towards families. Future studies warrant the investigation of additional risk and protective factors that can affect maternal and child outcomes.",14

Latent growth mixture model (LGMM) was used for statistical analysis in the software Mplus 8.0.The PTS developmental trajectories among children and adolescents exposed to the earthquake had four categories: the normal stress group (31.1%, class 1), the persistent impairment group (4.5%, class 2), the psychological recovery group (46.8%, class 3) and the persistent mild symptom group (17.6%, class 4). The PTS development trajectories were significantly different in two gender groups, and the proportion of girls in the persistently injured group was higher than other three groups.

The survey was administered to a spatially stratified, random sample of households in the three coastal counties of Mississippi. A total of 216 participants were included in this study who lived in close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico coastline during both disasters. Results from structural equation modeling analyses indicated that there was a significant and inverse relationship between PTG and loneliness. Conversely, a direct relationship was not found between PTG and depressive symptoms; instead, the results revealed an indirect relationship between PTG and depressive symptoms through loneliness. Social capital was related to loneliness only indirectly through PTG, while psychological resilience was related to loneliness both directly and indirectly through PTG. Understanding the relationships among these factors, particularly the importance of PTG, can provide insight into the long-term adaptation among those who have survived multiple disasters. Further, these findings may lead to nuanced methods for behavioral health practitioners in assessing and treating individuals with symptoms of depression in disaster-prone communities.",14
https://openalex.org/W3087432111,10.1177/0886260520958659,Does Prior Civilian Trauma Moderate the Relationship Between Combat Trauma and Post-deployment Mental Health Symptoms?,"In addition to combat trauma, childhood and adult non-military, interpersonal trauma exposures have been linked to a range of psychiatric symptoms (e.g., alcohol use problems, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depression symptoms) in veterans. However, few studies simultaneously explore the associations between these civilian and combat trauma types and mental health outcomes. Using a sample of combat-exposed veterans who were previously deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan (N = 302), this study sought to (a) understand the independent associations of civilian interpersonal trauma (i.e., childhood trauma and non-military adult trauma) and combat-related trauma with post-deployment alcohol use, PTSD symptoms, and depressive symptoms, respectively and (b) to examine the interactive effects of trauma type to test whether childhood and non-military adult trauma moderate the association of combat trauma with these outcomes. A path analytic framework was used to allow for the simultaneous prediction of these associations. In the final model non-military adult trauma and combat trauma were found to be significantly associated with PTSD symptoms and depression symptoms, but not average amount of drinks consumed per drinking day. Childhood trauma was not associated with any outcomes (i.e., PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, average amount of drinks consumed per day). Only combat trauma was significantly associated with average amount of drinks consumed per day. Results underscore the importance of assessing multiple trauma types and considering trauma as a non-specific risk factor, as different trauma types may differentially predict various mental health outcomes other than PTSD. Further, results highlight the noteworthiness of considering co-occurring outcomes within the veteran community. Limitations, future directions, and implications of diversity are discussed.",14

Following a course of intensive hospital-based ED treatment focused on ED behavioral symptom interruption, 10 individuals with ED-PTSD received 16 sessions of CBT that focused on maintaining improvements in ED symptoms outside of the hospital environment and integrated cognitive processing therapy for PTSD. We hypothesized that the treatment would be associated with significant improvements in PTSD symptoms, depression, and anxiety, as well as sustained improvements in ED symptomatology. There were statistically significant improvements in clinician-rated PTSD symptoms (gav = 4.58), depression (gav = 1.37), and anxiety (gav = 1.00). As expected, there was no statistically significant change in ED cognitions (gav = .28). Reliable change analyses revealed that only 1 participant experienced deterioration in ED cognitions over the course of the integrated treatment. Of the 9 participants who were remitted from behavioral ED symptoms at the end of intensive treatment/beginning of the integrated treatment, 8 remained behaviorally remitted at poststudy treatment, which is encouraging given the high rate of rapid relapse following intensive ED treatment. Findings from this study provide preliminary support for the efficacy of an integrated CBT for ED-PTSD.",14

Little research exists on the psychosocial adjustment of refugee children and adolescents resettled in Lebanon and Jordan.This study investigated the prevalence and predictors of PTSD and emotion dysregulation in Syrian refugee children and adolescents who resettled in Lebanon and Jordan. It was hypothesized that a combination of pre-trauma variables (age and gender), trauma-specific variables (traumatic events and time spent in host country, and host country), and post-trauma variables (coping strategies, family relationships, and school environment) would be associated with PTSD and emotion dysregulation.Participants were 1000 Syrian refugee children and adolescents aged 7-18 years attending formal and non-formal schools representing various governorates in Lebanon and Jordan.The trauma exposure scale, DSM-IV criteria for the assessment of PTSD, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form, Kidcope, Family relationship scales, and school environment scale were administered in an interview format with children and adolescents at school by two trained psychologists. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to predict PTSD whereas hierarchical multiple regression was used to predict emotion dysregulation.Results indicated that 45.6% of the refugees have developed PTSD with excessive risk for comorbidity with emotion dysregulation. Emotion dysregulation was reported by older refugee children and adolescents. The prevalence of PTSD was higher in refugee children and adolescents who had resettled in Lebanon than for those who had resettled in Jordan. Refugee children and adolescents who were exposed to higher levels of war atrocities evidenced the greatest prevalence of PTSD and emotion dysregulation. PTSD symptomatology and emotion dysregulation in children and adolescents varied according to coping styles, family relationships, and school environment. Both decreased significantly with the passage of time spent in host country.The results may be used to formulate cognitive-behavioral coping interventions that can lead to optimal developmental outcomes in the posttrauma environment.",14

https://openalex.org/W2396878059,10.1371/journal.pone.0156216,Mental Suffering in Protracted Political Conflict: Feeling Broken or Destroyed,"Purpose This mixed-methods exploratory study identified and then developed and validated a quantitative measure of a new construct of mental suffering in the occupied Palestinian territory: feeling broken or destroyed. Methods Group interviews were conducted in 2011 with 68 Palestinians, most aged 30–40, in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip to discern local definitions of functioning. Interview participants articulated of a type of suffering not captured in existing mental health instruments used in regions of political conflict. In contrast to the specific difficulties measured by depression and PTSD (sleep, appetite, energy, flashbacks, avoidance, etc.), participants elaborated a more existential form of mental suffering: feeling that one’s spirit, morale and/or future was broken or destroyed, and emotional and psychological exhaustion. Participants articulated these feelings when describing the rigors of the political and economic contexts in which they live. We wrote survey items to capture these sentiments and administered these items—along with standard survey measures of mental health—to a representative sample of 1,778 32–43 year olds in the occupied Palestinian territory. The same survey questions also were administered to a representative subsample (n = 508) six months earlier, providing repeated measures of the construct. Results Across samples and time, the feeling broken or destroyed scale: 1) comprised a separate factor in exploratory factor analyses, 2) had high inter-item consistency, 3) was reported by both genders and in all regions, 4) showed discriminate validity via moderate correlations with measures of feelings of depression and trauma-related stress, and 5) was more commonly experienced than either feelings of depression or trauma-related stress. Conclusions Feeling broken or destroyed can be reliably measured and distinguished from conventional measures of mental health. Such locally grounded and contextualized measures should be identified and included in assessments of the full impact of protracted political conflict on functioning.",15

To date, posttraumatic growth (PTG) has been studied primarily in the context of significant trauma; thus, it is not known whether stressful life events are associated with PTG. This study investigated the development of PTG among 113 police officers working in the New Orleans area following Hurricane Katrina. Hierarchical regression was used to evaluate if gratitude, social support, and satisfaction with life moderated the relationship between stressful life events (as measured by the total life stress score) and PTG, after adjustment for age, sex, race, level of involvement in Hurricane Katrina, and alcohol intake. Results indicate that stressful life events are independently associated with PTG. Gratitude, satisfaction with life, and social support were seen to moderate this relationship; as stressful life events increased so too did PTG—particularly among officers with higher levels of gratitude (B = 0.002, p ≤ .05), satisfaction with life (B = 0.002, p ≤ .05), and social support (B = 0.001, p ≤ .05). These findings suggest that promoting satisfaction with life, interpersonal support, and gratitude may be beneficial to those who are regularly at risk of trauma exposure.",15

The study utilized a mixed-method design. In-depth interviews were conducted using a prepared script. PTSD was assessed using the PTSD checklist-civilian (PCL-C; a score ≥ 50 indicates probable PTSD). Thematic analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with PTSD. A purposive sample of 29 WTC evacuees was recruited using a multimodal recruitment strategy. Eligibility included: history of evacuation from the WTC (Tower 1 and/or Tower 2) on September 11, 2001, and decisional capacity for informed consent. Five participants had PCL-C scores ≥ 50. Thematic analysis identified resiliency factors (protective for PTSD), including leadership, taking action based on “gut” feelings (to evacuate), social support (staying in a group), going on “automatic survival” mode, and previous training on emergency response. Risk factors for PTSD included lack of emergency response training, lack of sense of urgency, poor physical condition, lack of communication skills, lack of direction, peri-event physical injury, peri-event traumatic exposure (horror), and moral injury (guilt and remorse). Several modifiable factors that may confer resilience were identified. In particular, the role of emergency response training in preventing disaster-related mental illness should be explored as a possible strategy for enhancing resilience to disaster events.",15

Participants were assessed between 1987 and 2007 with structured diagnostic interviews in a prospective longitudinal design. Consistent research methods allowed merging of the disaster databases for analysis using multivariate modeling. Postdisaster major depression in the study cohort from the 9/11 disaster was more than twice as prevalent as in the other disasters, possibly reflecting the greater psychosocial/interpersonal loss and bereavement experienced by 9/11 disaster survivors. At follow up, employment was associated with remission of postdisaster major depression, non-development of PTSD, and coping via family or friends. Functioning problems were associated with disaster injuries, but not with persistent major depression. This study is unprecedented in its large sample of survivors across the full range of disaster typology studied using consistent methods and full structured interview diagnostic assessment.

The growth mixture modeling analysis was used to identify latent classes of self-esteem trajectories.Three classes of self-esteem trajectories were identified. The majority of adults (88.0%) reported stable high self-esteem over time. A second class (low-level increasing: 7.7%) reported low levels of self-esteem, which gradually increased to high levels by the end of the study.

This cross-sectional study used baseline data from adult (30–75 years) participants of the Puerto Rico Observational Study of Psychosocial, Environmental, and Chronic Disease Trends (PROSPECT). Enrolled individuals prior to COVID-19 who completed a 33-item questionnaire on Hurricane María-related experiences (sub-categorized as personal, service, or property losses), depression symptomatology, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety were included for analysis (n = 456). Most participants experienced fear for their family's safety, damage to their home and personal items, communication outages, and water shortages. Each additional stressor was significantly associated with higher odds of depression symptoms, PTSD, and anxiety. Personal losses were significantly associated with higher likelihood of all outcomes, while services losses were associated with depression symptoms and anxiety; property loss was not significantly associated with any outcome. Adverse experiences during a major natural disaster are associated with mental and emotional distress. Strategies to minimize hardships during natural disasters, especially personal and service losses, are essential to preserve mental health.

We aimed to establish whether Swedish survivors of tsunamis from the 2004 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake had increased risks of psychiatric disorders and suicide attempts 5 years after repatriation. Methods We identified Swedish survivors repatriated from southeast Asia (8762 adults and 3742 children) and 864 088 unexposed adults and 320 828 unexposed children matched for sex, age, and socioeconomic status. We retrieved psychiatric diagnoses and suicide attempts from the Swedish patient register for the 5 years after the tsunami (from Dec 26, 2004, to Jan 31, 2010) and estimated hazard ratios (HRs), then adjusted for pre-tsunami psychiatric disorders, and, for children, for parental pre-tsunami disorders. Findings Exposed adults were more likely than unexposed adults to receive any psychiatric diagnosis (547 [6·2%] vs 47 734 [5·5%]; adjusted HR 1·21, 95% CI 1·11–1·32), particularly stress-related disorders (187 [2·1%] vs 8831 [1·0%]; 2·27, 1·96–2·62) and suicide attempts (38 [0·43%] vs 2752 [0·32%]; 1·54, 1·11–2·13), but not mood or anxiety disorders. Risk of psychiatric diagnoses did not differ between exposed and unexposed children and adolescents (248 [6·6] vs 22 081 [6·9%]; 0·98, 0·86–1·11), although exposed children and adolescents had a higher risk for suicide attempts with uncertain intent (1·43; 1·01–2·02) and stress-related disorders (1·79; 1·30–2·46), mainly during the first 3 months after the tsunami. Interpretation The 2004 tsunami was, independently of previous psychiatric morbidity, associated with an increased risk of severe psychopathology, mainly stress-related disorders and suicide attempts, in children and adults. Survivors of natural disasters should be targeted with early interventions and active long-term follow-up to prevent, detect, and alleviate psychiatric disorders that might follow.

First, the study documented a moderate association between parental PTSD symptoms and child mental health symptoms during the postdeployment reintegration period. This association was significant even after accounting for marital distress. Second, the study demonstrated that the impact of PTSD symptoms on child mental health symptoms may be explained by parental general aggression such that aggression mediated the PTSD symptoms–child mental health association.",15

Similarities and differences with the dimensions of a widely used PTG quantitative measure are outlined, and a possible veteran experience of growth and how it develops is described. The conclusions provide a basis for further investigation into the experience, acceptability and clinical application of PTG within a UK veteran-specific population.",15

The current study aimed to analyse these four distinct response patterns during the pandemic using network analysis. Anxiety and depression symptom data collected across four European countries over the first year of the pandemic were analysed (N = 3594). Participants were firstly categorised into one of the four aforementioned response patterns. Networks of symptoms were then estimated in each of these groups, and they were compared in relation to network connectivity and symptom clustering. Informed by network theory, it was hypothesised that greater levels of resiliency would be characterised by lower symptom connectivity and fewer symptom clusters. Two-thirds (64%) of the sample were categorised as displaying a pattern of Resilience. The connectivity hypothesis was partially supported: the Sustained distress group show higher connectivity than the Recovered group; however, the Resilient group showed higher connectivity than the Delayed distress group. Regarding symptom clustering, non-random clusters were identified in the Recovered and Sustained groups only, and, in contrast to the initial hypotheses, more clusters emerged in the Recovered group (three) than in the Sustained distress group (two). Our results replicated findings that resilience was the most common mental health pattern over the first year of the pandemic. Moreover, they suggested that high network connectivity may be indicative of a stable mental health response over time, whereas fewer symptom clusters may be indicative of a pattern of sustained distress. Although exploratory, the network perspective provided a useful tool to examine the complexity of patterns of psychological responses to adverse events, and if replicated, could be used to help identify indicators of protection against, or vulnerability to, psychological distress in future.",16

The aim of the current study was to test the correlation between quality of life (QoL) and mental health outcomes, and the role of sociodemographic variables in predicting mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, and stress) among Palestinian adults during a challenging period of political conflict. The sample of our study consisted of 957 participants, 283 males and 674 females they were recruited using online methods; online advertisements, e-mail campaigns and social media. Our findings showed that QoL negatively correlated with stress (r = - 0.43, p < 0.01), anxiety (r = - 0.46, p < 0.01), and depression (r = - 0.47, p < 0.05). Moreover, stress positively correlated with anxiety (r = 0.81, p < 0.01), and depression (r = 0.89, p < 0.01). Finally, anxiety positively correlated with depression (r = 0.82, p < 0.01). Results of hierarchical regression analysis to predict stress, anxiety and depression, indicated that QoL, educational level, gender, region of residence, and age explained in a significant way variance in depression, anxiety and stress. Our findings are promising to conduct other studies in order to understand better how current study variables correlate to each other, so appropriate clinical interventions to mitigate the negative effects of depression, anxiety, and stress through enhancing quality of life and positive coping strategies can be developed and implemented by mental health providers.",16

Although both samples represent military veterans, only one sample experienced actual combat, i.e., active fighting in a war against an enemy. All data were collected via online survey. Demographically, both samples were predominately White male, with a four-year college degree being the highest education level frequency. The average participant age was 29 years and there was no significant mean age difference between the samples. In addition, there were no significant sample differences in the total number of traumatic events experienced or time since the most powerful traumatic event was experienced. The purposes of this study were to: (1) test if four positive coping strategies were related to Post Traumatic Growh (PTG), and (2) to determine if there were differences in the use of these four coping strategies or experienced PTG for non-combat versus combat military veterans. The four positive coping styles were measured, instrumental support, emotional support, religion, and acceptance. For the combined sample, two coping styles, instrumental support and religion were each significant positively related to post traumatic growth (PTG). Significant sample differences were found on instrumental support and religion such that the non-combat veterans perceived higher mean levels on both coping styles versus the combat veterans. No sample difference was found for PTG. Future research directions and study limitations are discussed.",16

This study examined the relationship between history of being bullied and/or assaulted and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among responders to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster. During 2015–2016, a modified life events checklist was administered to responders at Stony Brook WTC Health Program. WTC-related PTSD symptoms were assessed by PTSD checklist (PCL). Longitudinal mixed models examined associations between bullying, other forms of assault, and severity and chronicity of PTSD symptoms. Approximately, 13% of 920 responders had probable WTC-PTSD (PCL≥44). Being bullied in childhood was associated with increased odds of WTC-PTSD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 7.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.12–25.34), adjusted for demographics, other stressors, and WTC exposures. PTSD odds decreased over time among those not bullied (aOR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73–0.92), but not among victims. Experiencing physical, sexual, or verbal assaults during adulthood also had a significant association with WTC-PTSD (aOR 4.64; 95% CI: 1.98–10.92). Findings suggest being bullied in childhood and/or assaulted in adulthood can increase PTSD risk and progression after mass trauma.",16

Further, examining predictors of PTSD pathology provides a better conceptualization of the temporal course of PTSD in trauma victims.The present study examined PTSD symptom severity in individuals presenting to the emergency department (ED) following a traumatic event. Participants (N = 147) were assessed at four timepoints: 2-weeks, 3-months, between 6 and 9 months, and 12-months after ED admission. Growth curve modeling was conducted to examine changes in PTSD symptom severity over time. Age, sex, state anxiety, trait anxiety, emotion dysregulation, depression, and trauma type (motor vehicle accident [MVA] and assault), and PTSD diagnosis were included as covariates in the model.Results demonstrated that baseline PTSD symptom severity was positively associated with severity of depression and state (but not trait) anxiety, emotion dysregulation, and PTSD diagnosis. Results also revealed significant associations with PTSD symptom changes over time; greater state anxiety and depression symptoms at baseline were associated with steeper declines in PTSD symptoms over time.Data were collected at only four timepoints over the course of 12-months.

Investigations to date have only evaluated comorbidities as indices, limiting the ability to target conditions and develop strategies for risk reduction. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the differential effects of specific conditions on long-term, patient-reported outcomes after burn injury. A prospectively maintained trauma registry was merged with a longitudinal database of patient-reported outcomes from a regional burn center from 2007 to 2018. Demographic data, injury-specific information, and the prevalence of 20 comorbidities were systematically documented. The impact of comorbidities on responses to Short Form-12/Veterans RAND 12 (SF/VR-12) health surveys at 6, 12, and 24 months postinjury was evaluated with generalized linear models. The merged dataset included 493 adult participants. Median age was 46 years (interquartile range, IQR 32–57 years), and 72% were male. Median burn size was 14% TBSA (IQR 5–28%). Seventy percent of participants had ≥1 comorbidity (median 1 comorbidity/participant; IQR 0–2 comorbidities). SF/VR-12 mental component summary scores at 6 and 12 months postinjury were negatively associated with mental illness (P &amp;lt; .001, P = .013). SF/VR-12 physical component summary (PCS) scores were negatively associated with smoking (P = .019), diabetes (P = .001), and alcohol use disorder (P = .001) at 6-month follow-up. Twelve-month SF/VR-12 PCS scores were negatively associated with prior trauma admission (P = .001) and diabetes (P = .042). Twenty-four-month SF/VR-12 PCS scores were negatively associated with mental illness (P = .003). Smoking, alcohol use disorder, and diabetes were associated with lower PCS scores 6 months after injury; diabetes persisted as a negatively associated covariate at 12 months. Mental component summary scores were negatively associated with mental illness 6 and 12 months postinjury. Integrated models of postdischarge comorbidity management need to be tested in burn patients.",16

Data was analyzed from the clinical subsample of the Ohio Army National Guard Mental Health Initiative (OHARNG MHI). Five hundred participants were provided with an in-depth clinical assessment using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID). Logistic regression examined the relationship between Axis I disorders and the number of deployments and gender. Prevalence of at least one DSM-IV lifetime disorder was 66.2%; substance use disorders were 52.2%, followed by mood disorders (30.0%) and anxiety disorders (22.0%). Prevalence of at least one current disorder was 24.8%; anxiety disorders (13.2%), mood disorders (7.6%), and substance use disorders (7.0%) were most frequent.

Instead of aggregating exposure to political violence across time and type of exposure, as is commonly done, the event history calendar pioneered in this study assessed exposure to five forms of political violence annually from 1987 to 2011 in a representative sample of 1788 adults, aged 37 on average, in the occupied Palestinian territories (West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip). This method allowed for the identification of trajectories of exposure to political violence from childhood to adulthood using latent profile analysis. We then correlated the trajectories of exposure to measures of economic, political, community, family, psychological, and health functioning. As expected, being shot at, having one's home raided, being hit or kicked, being verbally abused, and witnessing someone close being humiliated were all elevated during periods of heightened political conflict (the first intifada (1987-1993) and, less so, the second intifada (2000-2005)). In addition, 12% of women and men reported high and persistent levels of exposure to humiliation (being verbally abused and/or witnessing someone close being humiliated) across the entire 25-year period. These individuals lived predominantly in neighborhoods with a high Israeli military presence. Compared to those who experienced periodic exposure to political violence, persistently humiliated men and women reported significantly lower health, economic, political, and psychological functioning, as well as higher social cohesion and political expression. Relevant literatures are reviewed when concluding that persistent humiliation is a neglected form of political violence that is best represented as a direct (versus structural), acute (versus chronic), macro (versus micro), and high-grade (versus low-grade) stressor whose particular injury is due to the violation of individual and collective identity, rights, justice and dignity.",17

In total, 2686 veterans treated for PTSD between 2002 and 2015 across 14 hospitals in Australia completed the PTSD Checklist at intake, discharge, and 3 and 9 months follow-up. Predictor variables included co-morbid mental health problems, relationship functioning, employment and compensation status.Five distinct classes were found: those with the most severe PTSD at intake separated into a relatively large class (32.5%) with small change, and a small class (3%) with a large change. Those with slightly less severe PTSD separated into one class comprising 49.9% of the total sample with large change effects, and a second class comprising 7.9% with extremely large treatment effects. The final class (6.7%) with least severe PTSD at intake also showed a large treatment effect. Of the multiple predictor variables, depression and guilt were the only two found to predict differences in response trajectories.These findings highlight the importance of assessing guilt and depression prior to treatment for PTSD, and for severe cases with co-morbid guilt and depression, considering an approach to trauma-focused therapy that specifically targets guilt and depression-related cognitions.",17

This moderating effect was absent in non-traditional responders. Across both groups, post-disaster life stress also consistently was related to the dependent variables in a more robust manner than WTC exposure. : The present findings suggest that WTC exposure may compound post-disaster life stress, thereby resulting in a more chronic course of PTSD symptoms and reduced functioning among police responders.",17

But it remains unclear whether unit cohesion modifies the association between deployment-related traumatic exposure and mental health problems. To examine the association between unit cohesion, traumatic exposure and poor mental health [symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychological distress and alcohol dependency] and assess whether the relationship between traumatic exposure and poor mental health differs by level of unit cohesion. A self-reported cross-sectional survey of Australian military personnel deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan between 2001 and 2009. Among 11411 participants, those with low levels of unit cohesion had higher odds of PTSD symptoms [aOR (95% CI): 2.54 (1.88, 3.42)], very high psychological distress [aOR (95% CI): 4.28 (3.04, 6.02)] and a high level of alcohol problems [aOR (95% CI): 1.71 (1.32, 2.22)] compared with those reporting high unit cohesion on deployment. Higher exposure to traumatic events on deployment was associated with greater risk of PTSD symptoms, very high levels of psychological distress and high levels of alcohol problems in this cohort. However, there was no evidence of a statistically significant interaction between unit cohesion and traumatic exposures in influencing poor mental health. Our findings suggest that both unit cohesion and traumatic exposure are independently associated with poor mental health. Efforts to improve military unit cohesion may help to improve the mental health resilience of military personnel, regardless of their level of traumatic exposure.",17

This study aims to examine the demographic and clinical factors associated with depression symptoms at 12 months post-injury. This data will be used to develop a depression risk scoring system. Methods Data from the Burn Model System National Database (2015–2019) were analyzed. Depression subscale scores of the PROMIS-29 were examined at 12 months and those with scores greater than 60 were considered to have depression symptoms. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population were compared between those with and without depression symptoms. Predictors of depression symptoms at 12 months post-injury were determined using multivariate logistic regression. Results The analysis included 298 individuals (52 with and 246 without depression symptoms). Those with depression symptoms at 12 months post-injury were more likely to be female, have had psychological treatment in the year prior to injury, and have sustained a suspected self-inflicted burn injury. Those with depression symptoms were less likely to be married or working at the time of injury compared to those without depression symptoms. No differences in age, burn size, race/ethnicity, etiology of injury, or education level were observed between groups (Table 1). Psychological therapy or counseling in the year prior to injury was the only significant predictor of depression symptoms at 12 months post-injury (p= 0.016). Age and female gender approached significance (p=0.092 and p= 0.086, respectively). Conclusions A history of recent pre-injury psychological treatment was the only significant predictor of depressive symptoms found one-year post-injury. Applicability of Research to Practice This data will be used to create a depression risk scoring system to be used at time of acute care admission to identify burn survivors who are at high risk of developing depression. Identifying those at high risk of depression will facilitate appropriate utilization of resources and potential treatment prophylaxis.",17

However, little is known about factors that maintain PTSD symptoms. This study is part of the Akershus Birth Cohort. Questionnaire data from pregnancy week 17, 8 weeks postpartum and 2 years postpartum were used. 1473 women completed all these three questionnaires and were included in the analyses. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured with the Impact of Event Scale. Potential maintaining factors were personality, sleep, support and life events. The factors that were significantly correlated with post-traumatic stress symptoms were entered into regression analyses. Mediation analyses were run to test whether significant predictors would serve as mediator of post-traumatic stress symptoms at 8 weeks postpartum to post-traumatic stress symptoms at 2 years postpartum. We found several low to moderate associations between maintaining factors and PTSD symptoms two years postpartum. Adjusting for the starting point – PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum – only insomnia remained significantly associated. Further, insomnia mediated a small portion of the effect of PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum to PTSD symptoms 2 years postpartum. Limitations of the study include a relative homogeneous sample, modest effect sizes, low internal consistency of some of the measures and the challenge to distinguish insomnia from PTSD symptoms. Treatment of postpartum PTSD might benefit from addressing insomnia if present. Alleviating insomnia may itself reduce daytime symptoms of PTSD and it may also increase the efficacy of primary PTSD treatments.",18

Associations between stressful life events throughout the civilian lifecourse-including during childhood-and adult depression have been documented in many populations, but are less commonly assessed in military samples. We identified different trajectories of depression symptoms across four years in a military cohort using latent class growth analysis, and investigated the relationship between these trajectories and two domains of civilian life experiences: childhood adversity (e.g., being mistreated during childhood) and more proximal stressful experiences (e.g., divorce). A four-group depression model was identified, including a symptom-free group (62%), an increasing symptom group (13%), a decreasing symptom group (16%), and a ""chronic"" symptom group (9%). Compared to the symptom-free group, soldiers with childhood adversity were more likely to be in the chronic depression, decreasing, and increasing symptom groups. Time-varying adult stressors had the largest effect on depression symptoms for the increasing symptom group compared to other groups, particularly in the last two years of follow-up.

We used original data from four groups: Israelis and Palestinians (n = 2,572), and Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland (n = 343). Looking at these two conflicts, we found that the positive relationship between exposure to violence and posttraumatic stress symptoms ceases to exist in a post-conflict setting (F(1, 2053) = 4.95, p < .05, η2 = 0.002). Interestingly, we found that PTS symptoms were highest among minority group members in an ongoing conflict irrespective of exposure to political violence (F(1, 2053) = 120.74, p < .001,η2 = 0.06). We provide explanations for these findings and discuss their psychological implications for victimized groups and the wider geopolitics of intergroup conflict.",18

The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), an objective functional assessment, was administered during monitoring exams between January and December 2015 to a consecutive sample of 1,268 rescue workers, volunteers, and other responders who had aided in response, recovery, and cleanup efforts at the World Trade Center (WTC) in New York after the September 11, 2011 attacks. Data were linked with diagnostic and longitudinal data from the WTC monitoring study. Multivariable analyses were used to examine predictors of functional limitations. Prevalence estimates weighted to the general responder population revealed a relatively high prevalence of functional limitations, SPPB ≤ 9; 16.0%, 95% CI [13.7, 18.4]. Current PTSD was associated with a twofold increased risk of functional limitations after controlling for predisposing factors, trauma severity, behavioral factors, and WTC‐related medical conditions, adjusted risk ratio (a RR ) = 2.11, 95% CI [1.48, 3.01]. Exposure to ergonomic risk factors at the WTC also increased the risk of functional impairments, a RR = 1.34 95% CI [1.05, 1.70]. Longitudinal results suggest that individuals with current functional limitations experienced high baseline PTSD severity, B = 2.94, SE = 1.33, and increasing PTSD symptom severity, B = 0.29, SE = 0.10, since September 11, 2001. This study identified a cross‐sectional relationship between functional limitations and PTSD and a worsening of PTSD symptoms in persons who eventually demonstrated functional limitations. Results highlight the potential role of chronic PTSD in functional limitations.",18

However, research into personality-based internalizing and externalizing trauma responses has been limited to cross-sectional investigations of PTSD comorbidity. Personality typologies may present an opportunity to identify and selectively intervene with survivors at risk of posttraumatic disorder. Therefore this study examined whether personality prospectively influences the trajectory of disorder in a broader trauma-exposed sample.During hospitalization for a physical injury, 323 Australian adults completed the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire-Brief Form and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, with the latter readministered 3 and 12 months later. Latent profile analysis conducted on baseline personality scores identified subgroups of participants, while latent change modelling examined differences in disorder trajectories.Three classes (internalizing, externalizing, and normal personality) were identified. The internalizing class showed a high risk of developing all disorders. Unexpectedly, however, the normal personality class was not always at lowest risk of disorder. Rather, the externalizing class, while more likely than the normal personality class to develop substance use disorders, were less likely to develop PTSD and depression.Results suggest that personality is an important mechanism in influencing the development and form of psychopathology after trauma, with internalizing and externalizing subtypes identifiable in the early aftermath of injury. These findings suggest that early intervention using a personality-based transdiagnostic approach may be an effective method of predicting and ultimately preventing much of the burden of posttraumatic disorder.",18

Researchers have used the pandemic as a use case for studying resilience in response to a global, synchronously starting, and chronic set of stressors on the individual and societal level. Our review of this recent literature reveals that mental distress trajectories during the pandemic largely resemble mental distress responses to individual-level macro-stressors, except for a lower prevalence of recovery trajectories. Results suggest more resilient responses in older adults, but trajectories are less consistent for younger and older ages compared with middle-aged adults.

Participants had been previously evaluated in 1991. Evaluations included assessment of current PTSD (based on DSM‐5 criteria), and a variety of potential risk and protective factors. For the whole sample, the rate of PTSD attributed to the earthquake decreased from 48.7% in 1991 to 11.6% in 2012 ( p &lt; .001). A “dose of exposure” pattern persisted, and 15.7% of participants who were in Spitak (high exposure) and 6.6% of participants who were in Kirovagan (low exposure) during the earthquake met the criteria for PTSD ( p = .003). Additionally, in 2012, another 9.9% of participants met PTSD criteria due to post‐earthquake traumas, which is a 5‐fold increase from pre‐ to postearthquake ( p &lt; . 001). Factors positively associated with PTSD included earthquake‐related job loss, exposure to post‐earthquake traumas, depression at baseline, and chronic illness since the earthquake. Factors inversely associated with PTSD included housing assistance within two years after the earthquake, support of family and/or friends, and to a lesser degree, higher education and high living standard. These variables accounted for 23.1% of the variance in current PTSD severity scores. These findings indicate that PTSD rates subside significantly after a catastrophic disaster, although earthquake‐related PTSD persists among a subgroup of exposed individuals. Predictors of PTSD identified in this study provide guidance for planning acute and longer‐term postdisaster public mental health recovery programs.",19

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of PTSD, its demographic, professional and familial determinants and its impact one year later in this population. From March to November 2012, 45 people aged at least 16 years old, for whom a medical assessment had been requested, were included. Demographic variables, floor on which victims lived, family status, professional status and addictive behaviour, before and after the event were recorded, as were the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and psychiatric or psychological support provided. Of the victims, 84% were immigrants and 59% suffered from PTSD. PTSD mainly affected immigrants (65%) (more particularly those who had arrived in France a short time before the trauma), young people (74%), women (86%), workers (86%), and persons who had psychiatric support (79%) after the fire. Increased alcohol and tobacco consumption, changes in employment status and family ties after the fire were more frequent in people who developed PTSD. Some determinants highlighted in our study are well known in the scientific literature while others are controversial. Multicentre and international studies should be conducted in order to adjust the risk factors for the nature of the trauma and the population's characteristics. Un incendie a dévasté un foyer où vivaient principalement des personnes issues de l’immigration. Le but de cette étude était de déterminer la prévalence d’un État de Stress Post-Traumatique (ESPT) un an après les faits, parmi les victimes et de comprendre les déterminants démographiques, professionnels et familiaux. Ont été incluses de mars à novembre 2012, 45 personnes, âgées de 16 ans minimum, pour lesquelles une expertise pénale avait été demandée. Ont été relevés des données démographiques, l’étage du logement, le statut familial, professionnel, les consommations alcoolique et tabagique avant et après les faits, ainsi que le suivi psychologique ou psychiatrique. L’ESPT a été évalué à partir de l’Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Quatre-vingt-quatre pour cent des personnes étaient issues de l’immigration et 59 % souffraient d’un ESPT. L’ESPT était majoritairement présent chez les personnes issues de l’immigration (65 %) (principalement celles qui étaient arrivées en France depuis peu), les jeunes (74 %), les femmes (86 %), celles qui travaillaient (86 %) et celles qui avaient bénéficié d’un suivi psychiatrique après les faits (79 %). Un an après les faits, l’augmentation des consommations d’alcool et de tabac, ainsi que les changements professionnels et familiaux, survenaient davantage chez les personnes souffrant d’un ESPT. Certains déterminants soulignés dans notre étude se retrouvent dans beaucoup d’autres études, tandis que d’autres sont plus controversés. Des études multicentriques et internationales devraient être menées afin d’ajuster le risque de développer un ESPT à la nature du traumatisme et aux déterminants de la population d’étude.",19

Separate models were conducted for symptom clusters in each intervention, examining pre-treatment PTSD symptoms, pre-treatment depression severity, age, index trauma, and outcome expectancies as potential moderators. Unconditioned growth models for both gCBT and gPCT showed reductions in intrusions, avoidance, negative cognitions/mood, and arousal/reactivity (all p < .001). Distinct moderators of recovery emerged for each treatment. Reductions in avoidance during gCBT were strongest at high levels of pre-treatment PTSD symptoms (low PTSD: p = .964, d = .05; high PTSD: p < .001, d = 1.31) whereas positive outcome expectancies enhanced reductions in cognitions/mood (low Expectancy: p = .120, d = .50; high Expectancy: p < .001, d = 1.13). For gPCT, high levels of pre-treatment depression symptoms negatively impacted change in both intrusion (low depression: p < .001, d = .96; high depression: p = .376, d = .22) and arousal/reactivity (low depression: p < .001, d = .95; high depression: p = .092, d = .39) symptoms. Results support the importance of examining trajectories of change and their moderators for specific treatments, particularly when contrasting trauma focused and non-trauma focused treatments.",19

Despite this, a relative dearth of literature has focused on the experiences of deployed military medical personnel. As such, the present study aimed to address this gap in the literature by conducting individual and small group interviews with Air Force medical personnel who had recently returned from a deployment to Iraq. Interviews targeted self-reported factors related to psychological risk and resiliency across the deployment cycle, while also seeking recommendations for future military medical personnel preparing for medical deployments. Materials and Methods Inductive thematic analyses were conducted on transcripts from 12 individual and structured group interviews conducted with recently deployed U.S. Air Force medical personnel (N = 28). An interview script consisting of 18 prompts was carefully developed based on the experiences of study personnel. Two team members (n = 1 research psychologist; n = 1 military medical provider) coded exemplars from interview transcripts. A third team member (research psychologist) reviewed coded exemplars for consistency and retained themes when saturation was reached. Results In total we report on 6 primary themes. Participants reported feeling prepared to conduct their mission while deployed but often felt unprepared for the positions they assumed and the traumas they commonly experienced. Most participants reported deployment to be a rewarding experience, citing leader engagement, and social support as key protective factors against deployment-related stressors. Finally, following deployment, participants largely reported positive experiences reintegrating with their families but struggled to reintegrate into their workplace. Conclusion Findings from the present study indicate that the military is largely doing a good job preparing Air Force medical providers to deploy. Results of the present study indicate that military medical personnel would benefit from: (1) increased predictability surrounding deployment timelines, (2) improved cross-cultural training, (3) advanced training for atypical injuries in unconventional patient populations, and (4) improvements in postdeployment workplace reintegration. The present research has the potential to positively impact the overall quality of life for deploying military service members and their families; while simultaneously highlighting the successes and shortfalls in the deployment process for U.S. military medical personnel.",19

Baseline assessment (T0) data were collected before surgery and included demographic, biological (clinical characteristics), psychological (psychological resilience, self-efficacy, psychological distress, hope, medical coping mode) and social (social support) factors. Resilience measurements were repeated at 3 days after surgery (T1), the date of discharge (T2), and 1 month (T3) and 3 months (T4) after discharge. Latent growth mixture modelling was employed to define different resilience trajectories. Predictors of class membership were identified using multinomial logistic regression.Data from 198 patients were analysed. Three latent classes were identified with similar patterns in different intercepts, showing a significant decrease in resilience from admission (T0) to 3 days after surgery (T1) followed by an increase from T1 to T4. The three trajectories of psychological resilience were named the stable-resilience class (65.66%), high-resilience class (17.68%), and low-resilience class (16.66%). Multinomial logistic regression showed that compared with the stable-resilience class, the high-resilience class was predicted by having a higher level of hope, having higher education, living in urban areas and having more children, while the low-resilience class was predicted by having lower levels of self-efficacy and hope, living in semirural areas, and having more children.The three trajectories indicated that surgery was the major stressor influencing patients' psychological resilience and that patients in the low-resilience class needed to be intervened.Predictors of patients in different classes provide evidence for the identification of vulnerable populations and lay a foundation for future research contributing to the development of targeted interventions for improving patients' psychological resilience. No patient or public contribution but the time points of investigation were decided based on our interviews with 12 total knee arthroplasty patients.",19

Results of studies have also shown a high prevalence (58–80%) of post-traumatic stress disorder in war-affected children living in the occupied Palestinian territory. The aim of this study was to estimate the direct and indirect effects of perceived life satisfaction on the consequences of children's exposure to trauma and the balance of positive and negative affect.MethodsPalestinian children were recruited from primary schools in four refugee camps in the Gaza Strip (Bureij, Gaza Beach Camp, Jabalia, Rafah). All children had been involved in or witnessed one or more episodes of violence involving other people in the 2 months prior to the study (the 2012 Gaza War). We used the Multidimensional Students Life Satisfaction Scale (peers, self, living environment, school, family), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children, and the revised Children Impact of Events scale (intrusion and avoidance symptoms) to test (through structural equation modelling) the moderation effect of life satisfaction on war trauma via positive emotions.Findings1276 Palestinian children were enrolled in this study. The model tested with structural equation modelling was robust. Children's life satisfaction influenced both the intrusion (β=–0·48; p=0.003) and avoidance (β=–11; p=0·021) effects of primary traumatisation. The consequences of primary traumatisation by intrusion (β=0·34; p=0·008) and avoidance (β=0·27; p=0.011) contributed to increasing negative affect. Finally, perceived life satisfaction had direct effects on affective experience, specifically increasing positive affect and diminishing negative affect.InterpretationPerceived quality of life in children has a role in controlling war-related traumas. Life satisfaction contributes both directly and indirectly to change affectivity. When children perceive themselves to be highly satisfied with their home and school environment, living conditions, and relationships with peers and parents, the effects of trauma are less severe.FundingNone.",19

A longitudinal design with three points in time (i.e., 1, 6, and 12 months after the accident) was used. PTG, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), subjective severity of the event, deliberate rumination, and seeking social support were evaluated. In addition, time since the accident, age, and gender were included as predictors in our model. Deliberate rumination and seeking social support significantly predicted PTG trajectory in a multilevel model. Practical conclusions from the results suggest that work accident victims should be encouraged to seek social support and to positively reframe their experience.",19

However, their interactive effect is not well documented, especially after experiencing psychological trauma.This study examined the role of hazardous alcohol use (i.e. repeated patterns of drinking which lead to harmful consequences) on behavioral healthcare utilization among service members stratified by past-year combat exposure.This study utilized a sample of National Guard service members who participated in an in-depth survey 2-4 months after returning from Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation New Dawn deployments (2011-2013) (n = 467). We examine the marginal effect (the change in the probability) of hazardous alcohol use on utilization while controlling for trauma exposure, PTSD and other potential covariates.In the unadjusted logistic model, hazardous alcohol use reduced the probability of behavioral healthcare utilization by 77% among service members who had been exposed to combat within the past year. In the adjusted model, which controlled for socio-demographics (age, gender, and race), health status (PTSD symptoms, depression and physical health), and measures of stigma (perception of services as embarrassing or harmful to one's career or social networks), hazardous alcohol use further reduced the utilization probability by 302%. CONCLUSION/IMPORTANCE: Although these findings require replication, they appear to demonstrate that when combat-exposed service members engaged in hazardous alcohol use at postdeployment, they were much less likely to utilize behavioral healthcare to manage their posttraumatic stress symptoms during this period.",19

The inconsistent signal may reflect the use of data analytic tools that are ill equipped for modeling the complex interactions between biological and environmental factors that underlay post-traumatic psychopathology. Further, using symptom-based diagnostic status as the group outcome overlooks the inherent heterogeneity of PTSD, potentially contributing to failures to replicate. To examine the potential yield of novel analytic tools, we reanalyzed data from a large longitudinal study of individuals identified following trauma in the general emergency room (ER) that failed to find a linear association between cortisol response to traumatic events and subsequent PTSD. First, latent growth mixture modeling empirically identified trajectories of post-traumatic symptoms, which then were used as the study outcome. Next, support vector machines with feature selection identified sets of features with stable predictive accuracy and built robust classifiers of trajectory membership (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)=0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.80–0.85)) that combined clinical, neuroendocrine, psychophysiological and demographic information. Finally, graph induction algorithms revealed a unique path from childhood trauma via lower cortisol during ER admission, to non-remitting PTSD. Traditional general linear modeling methods then confirmed the newly revealed association, thereby delineating a specific target population for early endocrine interventions. Advanced computational approaches offer innovative ways for uncovering clinically significant, non-shared biological signals in heterogeneous samples.",19

Methods We used 4 waves (2010, 2013, 2016, and 2020) of the Iwanuma Study, which included pre-disaster information and 9 years of follow-up data among older survivors of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. Poisson regression analysis was used to examine the bidirectional associations between sleep problems and PTSS. Results Individuals reporting sleep problems before the disaster were more likely to develop PTSS after exposure to disaster trauma, while there was no effect modification, i.e. prevalence ratio for sleep problems did not differ by the magnitude of disaster damages. Individuals reporting sleep problems after the disaster were less likely to recover from PTSS, and more likely to develop the delayed onset of PTSS 5 years after the disaster. While individuals who recovered from PTSS 9 years after the disaster were still at slightly higher risk of having sleep problems compared to those who never had PTSS, none of the sleeping problems were found to be significantly prevalent after the Bonferroni correction. Conclusions Pre-disaster sleep problems predicted PTSS onset independently of experiences of disaster trauma. The association between PTSS and sleep problems was bidirectional. Intervening to mitigate lingering sleep problems may benefit the recovery of disaster survivors from post-traumatic symptoms.",19

https://openalex.org/W2972029105,,Examining the impact of meaning and resilience on survivors' life satisfaction after Hurricane Harvey,"The experience of a traumatic event such as a natural disaster can often lead individuals to suffer
a variety of negative sequelae, including the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms.
However, certain positive psychological constructs like meaning and resilience have been shown
to mitigate these consequences. The purpose of this study was to explore the contributions of
meaning and resilience to the life satisfaction of individuals (N = 55) impacted by 2017’s
Hurricane Harvey. It was hypothesized that not only would meaning and resilience be
significantly and positively related to life satisfaction but that meaning would contribute more to
the prediction of life satisfaction than resilience. Significant positive relationships were found
between meaning and life satisfaction (r = .51, p ≤ .05) and between resilience and life
satisfaction (r = .32, p ≤ .05) as was expected. After conducting a multiple regression analysis,
meaning was also found to significantly predict life satisfaction (β = .46, t(54) = 3.48, p = .001,
pr2 = .19), and did so to a greater extent than resilience (β = .13, t(54) = .97, p = .34, pr2 = .02),

WTCHR enrollees diagnosed with asthma after 11 September 2001 continued to experience poor control despite treatment. Asthma is associated with mental problems, although their bidirectional movement has not been studied. This study tested whether a clinical change in mental problems was associated with a difference in asthma control, and whether a change in asthma control varied with a change in quality of life (QoL). Difference in the Asthma Control Test (ACT) on the WTCHR from 2011-12 to 2015-16 was compared with the change in the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-17), the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, self-reported heartburn, and change of physical and mental QoL over this period. In adjusted multinomial multivariable logistic regression, improved PCL-17 was associated with a better ACT score, odds ratio (OR) = 1.42 (95% C.I. 1.01, 1.99), and a worsened PCL-17 score was associated with a worsened ACT score, OR = 1.77 (95% C.I. 1.26, 2.50).

Disturbances in sleep after burn injury were reported but all based on uncontrolled or nonstandardized data. The occurrence and the effect of long-term sleep problems in young adult burn survivors have not been well defined. This 5-year (2003-2008) prospective multicenter longitudinal study included adults with burn injuries ages 19 to 30 years who completed the Young Adult Burn Outcome Questionnaire (YABOQ) up to 36 months after injury. The items measured 15 patient-reported outcomes including physical, psychological, and social statuses and symptoms such as itch and pain. Scores of these 15 YABOQ outcome domains were standardized to a mean of 50 and a SD of 10 based on an age-matched nonburned reference group of young adults. Sleep quality was assessed using the item 'How satisfied are you now with your sleep,' rated by a 5-point Likert scale. Patients responding with very and somewhat dissatisfied were classified as having sleep dissatisfaction and the remaining as less or not dissatisfied. The associations between sleep dissatisfaction (yes/no) and YABOQ outcome domains were analyzed longitudinally using mixed-effect generalized linear models, adjusted for %TBSA burned, age, gender, and race. Generalized estimating equations were used to take into account correlated error resulting from repeated surveys on each patient over time. One hundred and fifty-two burn survivors participated in the YABOQ survey at baseline and during the follow-up who had at least one survey with a response to the sleep item. Among them, sleep dissatisfaction was twice as prevalent (76/152, 50%) when compared with the nonburned reference group (29/112, 26%). The likelihood of a burn survivor being dissatisfied with sleep was reduced over time after the burn injury. Sleep dissatisfaction following burns was significantly associated, in a dose-dependent manner, with increasing burn size (P = .001). Better sleep was associated with better outcomes in all domains (P < .05) except Fine Motor Function, and this association was significantly more apparent in the longer term compared with the shorter term with the same domains (P < .05). Dissatisfaction with sleep is highly prevalent following burn injuries in young adults. Lower satisfaction with sleep is associated with poorer scores in nearly all quality of life measures. Satisfaction with sleep should be addressed during the long-term clinical follow-up of young adults with burn injuries. Further research should be undertaken to understand the components of sleep quality that are important to burn survivors and which ones might be modified and tested in future intervention studies.",20

Psychosis is an exclusion criterion in most PTSD trials.To examine the efficacy and safety of prolonged exposure (PE) therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy in patients with psychotic disorders and comorbid PTSD.A single-blind randomized clinical trial with 3 arms (N = 155), including PE therapy, EMDR therapy, and waiting list (WL) of 13 outpatient mental health services among patients with a lifetime psychotic disorder and current chronic PTSD. Baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up assessments were made.Participants were randomized to receive 8 weekly 90-minute sessions of PE (n = 53), EMDR (n = 55), or WL (n = 47). Standard protocols were used, and treatment was not preceded by stabilizing psychotherapeutic interventions.Clinician-rated severity of PTSD symptoms, PTSD diagnosis, and full remission (on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale) were primary outcomes. Self-reported PTSD symptoms and posttraumatic cognitions were secondary outcomes.Data were analyzed as intent to treat with linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations. Participants in the PE and EMDR conditions showed a greater reduction of PTSD symptoms than those in the WL condition. Between-group effect sizes were 0.78 (P < .001) in PE and 0.65 (P = .001) in EMDR. Participants in the PE condition (56.6%; odds ratio [OR], 3.41; P = .006) or the EMDR condition (60.0%; OR, 3.92; P < .001) were significantly more likely to achieve loss of diagnosis during treatment than those in the WL condition (27.7%). Participants in the PE condition (28.3%; OR, 5.79; P = .01), but not those in the EMDR condition (16.4%; OR, 2.87; P = .10), were more likely to gain full remission than those in the WL condition (6.4%). Treatment effects were maintained at the 6-month follow-up in PE and EMDR. Similar results were obtained regarding secondary outcomes. There were no differences in severe adverse events between conditions (2 in PE, 1 in EMDR, and 4 in WL). The PE therapy and EMDR therapy showed no difference in any of the outcomes and no difference in participant dropout (24.5% in PE and 20.0% in EMDR, P = .57).Standard PE and EMDR protocols are effective, safe, and feasible in patients with PTSD and severe psychotic disorders, including current symptoms.

However, multivariable analyses revealed that prior psychiatric diagnosis, greater severity of WTC-related exposures, post-9/11 stressful life events, (in police responders only) older age, and (in nontraditional responders only) lower income and education levels accounted for substantially higher prevalence of WTC-related PTSD across ethnic/racial groups. Additionally, among nontraditional responders, subgroups with added risk included responders who were: Latino/a or White had high post-911 stressful events; Latino/a or Black and had pre-9/11 psychiatric history; and Latinas. Among police responders, subgroups with added risk were Latino/a or Black police with a low annual income.Collectively, results of this study underscore the burden of differential vulnerability that can contribute to higher prevalence of PTSD in certain cultural subgroups following large magnitude traumatic events.

Data were drawn from a 6-site randomized trial of collaborative primary care for PTSD and dpression in the military. Subjects were 474 soldiers with PTSD (scores ≥ 50 on the PTSD Checklist -Civilian Version). Four assessments were completed at U.S. Army installations: baseline, and follow-ups at 3 months (92.8% response rate [RR]), 6 months (90.1% RR), and 12 months (87.1% RR). Combat exposure and 7 validated indicators of baseline clinical status (alcohol misuse, depression, pain, somatic symptoms, low mental health functioning, low physical health functioning, mild traumatic brain injury) were used to predict PTSD symptom severity on the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (Cronbach's α = .87, .92, .95, .95, at assessments 1-4, respectively). Growth mixture modeling identified 2 PTSD symptom trajectories: subjects reporting persistent symptoms (Persisters, 81.9%, n = 388), and subjects reporting improved symptoms (Improvers 18.1%, n = 86). Logistic regression modeling examined baseline predictors of symptom trajectories, adjusting for demographics, installation, and treatment condition.

However, few studies examine the longitudinal progression of PTSD symptoms concurrent with related symptom domains and functional outcomes, such that may neglect important longitudinal patterns of symptom progression beyond PTSD specifically.Therefore, we used longitudinal causal discovery analysis to examine the longitudinal interrelations among PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, substance abuse, and various other domains of functioning in five longitudinal cohorts representing veterans (n = 241), civilians seeking treatment for anxiety disorders (n = 79), civilian women seeking treatment for post-traumatic stress and substance abuse (n = 116), active duty military members assessed 0-90 days following TBI (n = 243), and civilians with a history of TBI (n = 43).The analyses revealed consistent, directed associations from PTSD symptoms to depressive symptoms, independent longitudinal trajectories of substance use problems, and cascading indirect relations from PTSD symptoms to social functioning through depression as well as direct relations from PTSD symptoms to TBI outcomes.Our findings suggest PTSD symptoms primarily drive depressive symptoms over time, tend to show independence from substance use symptoms, and may cascade into impairment in other domains. The results have implications for refining conceptualization of PTSD co-morbidity and can inform prognostic and treatment hypotheses about individuals experiencing PTSD symptoms along with co-occurring distress or impairment.",20

Objective: The present study examines symptom profiles of PTSD and CG among bereaved Sichuan earthquake survivors 1 year after the disaster. Method: Self-report measures of demographic, disaster, and loss-related characteristics and symptoms of PTSD and CG were administered among 803 survivors (63% women; mean age = 46.7 years). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify subgroups of people with different PTSD and CG symptom profiles. Results: The LCA demonstrated that a five-class solution yielded the best fit, consisting of a CG class with low PTSD and high CG (N = 208), a combined class with high PTSD and high CG (N = 205), a class with low PTSD and partial CG (N = 145), a class with partial PTSD and CG (N = 136), and a resilient class with low PTSD and CG (N = 108). Being a woman (vs man), losing a child or spouse (vs other), being injured (vs non-injured), and/or having a missing family member (vs non-missing) predicted membership of the CG class compared to other classes. Conclusions: CG appears to be a unique consequence of disasters involving many casualties. Disaster survivors should be screened for CG and provided with appropriate psychological treatment.Antecedentes: Los estudios en la salud mental luego de desastres se ha centrado principalmente en el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT), pero el duelo discapacitante y permanente (por ejemplo, duelo complicado, DC) también pareciera ser importante.Objetivo: El presente estudio examina los perfiles de síntomas de TEPT y DC entre los sobrevivientes del terremoto de Sichuan que perdieron a un ser querido, un año después del desastre.Método: A los 803 sobrevivientes (63% mujeres, edad media = 46,7 años), se les administraron medidas de auto-reporte sobre las características demográficas, del desastre, y relacionadas a la pérdida como también síntomas de TEPT y DC. El análisis de clases latentes (LCA en sus siglas en inglés) fue llevado a cabo para identificar subgrupos de personas con diferentes perfiles de TEPT y DC.Resultados: El LCA demostró que una solución de cinco clases presentó el mejor ajuste, consistiendo de una clase de DC con bajo TEPT y alto DC (N = 208), una clase combinada de alto TEPT y alto DC (N = 205), una clase de bajo TEPT y DC parcial (N = 145), una clase con TEPT y DC parciales (N = 136), y una clase resiliente con bajo TEPT y DC (N = 108). Ser mujer (vs. hombre), perder un hijo/a o cónyuge (vs. otro), estar lesionado/a (vs. no lesionado/a), y/o tener a un familiar perdido (vs. no perdido) predijeron la pertenencia a la clase del DC comparado a las otras clases.Conclusiones: El DC surge como una consecuencia única de los desastres involucrando a muchas víctimas. Los sobrevivientes de desastres deberían ser pesquisados por DC y tener acceso a tratamiento psicológico adecuado.背景：有关灾难的研究通常都关注创伤后应激障碍（PTSD），然而持续而强烈的哀伤（即，复杂哀伤，CG）也同样值得关注。目的：本研究探索四川地震一年以后，失去亲人的灾民们的PTSD 和CG症状情况。方法：共有803名丧亲的灾民（63%是女性，平均年龄47岁）完成了自我报告的问卷，内容包括人口学变量，与灾难和丧失有关的情况，以及测量PTSD与CG的问卷。用潜分类分析（LCA）来检测被试的PTSD与CG 症状分组情况。结果：分析结果表明被试的最佳分类是5组，包括CG组：低PTSD和高CG （N = 208），混合组：高PTSD及高CG （N = 205），一组低PTSD和部分CG（N =145），一组部分PTSD和CG (N = 136)，以及复原组：低PTSD低CG（N = 108）。女性（相比男性），失去孩子或配偶（相比失去其他人），有家庭成员失踪（相比无失踪），有家庭成员失踪（相比无失踪）能预测CG组（相对于其他组而言）。结论：在有人员伤亡的灾难中，CG是单独呈现的一组症状。灾难幸存者的CG情况应该被筛查并给予相应的支持。.",20

Most people who experience such events recover from it; however, people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) continue to be severely depressed and anxious for several months or even years following the event. Palestinians are particularly at a higher risk for developing anxiety disorders and PTSD due to the continuous exposure to political violence, prolonged displacement, and other limitation on professional, educational, financial opportunities, and mental health services. This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the literature and established studies concerning Anxiety disorders besides PTSD in Palestine. Methods PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar was used to search for materials for the critical analysis of empirical articles. The following aspects were taken into consideration: study type, sample, and key findings. Results In this review, we included about twenty-four studies from Palestine (West Bank and Gaza). Five studies relate to children, five relate to adolescents, three relate to women, three relate to physical diseases, and four relate to gender and age differences. Results show that anxiety disorders and PTSD are one of the most common mental disorders in Palestine. Anxiety and PTSD develop from a complex set of risk factors, including genetics, personality, and life events. They are mostly associated with low quality of life and disability. The results indicate that a significant proportion of Palestinian experiencing serious issues that deal with several challenges, distinct barriers including; inconsistent availability of medications, absence of multidisciplinary teamwork, insufficient specialists, fragmented mental health system, and occupation. Conclusion As primary prevention, the occupation has to have considered as the main source of anxiety and other mental health disorders in Palestine. Besides, there is a need to implement a mental health care system through multidisciplinary work and raising awareness regarding the prevalence of mental disorders.",21

The variables examined were parenting stress (parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction and difficult child) and parental adjustment (depression, anxiety, and stress). Parents also completed a sociodemographic characterization survey. The statistical analyses were a correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analyses.Overall, not all components of parenting stress were related to parental adjustment. Only parental distress was found as a significant predictor of poor parental adjustment (greater depression, anxiety, and stress), but not parent-child dysfunctional interaction and having a difficult child.The present study findings highlight the influence of stress on parenting as a relevant dimension of research for the improvement of the intervention deployed by the state regarding the protection of vulnerable Chilean children, providing multiple clinical and psychosocial applications for research and intervention purposes.",21

Among responders to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster, PTSD is highly comorbid with lower respiratory symptoms (LRS), which cannot be explained by exposure alone. We sought to examine this association longitudinally to establish the direction of the effects and evaluate potential pathways to comorbidity.18,896 responders (8466 police and 10,430 nontraditional responders) participating in the WTC-Health Program were first evaluated between 2002 and 2010 and assessed again 2.5 years later. LRS were ascertained by medical staff, abnormal pulmonary function by spirometry, and probable WTC-related PTSD with a symptom inventory.In both groups of responders, initial PTSD (standardized regression coefficient: β = 0.20 and 0.23) and abnormal pulmonary function (β = 0.12 and 0.12) predicted LRS 2.5 years later after controlling for initial LRS and covariates. At follow-up, LRS onset was 2.0 times more likely and remission 1.8 times less likely in responders with initial PTSD than in responders without. Moreover, PTSD mediated, in part, the association between WTC exposures and development of LRS (p < .0001). Initial LRS and abnormal pulmonary function did not consistently predict PTSD onset.These analyses provide further evidence that PTSD is a risk factor for respiratory symptoms and are consistent with evidence implicating physiological dysregulation associated with PTSD in the development of medical conditions. If these effects are verified experimentally, treatment of PTSD may prove helpful in managing physical and mental health of disaster responders.",21

Here, we constructed four parental longitudinal depressive symptom trajectory groups and studied their associations with children's emotional problems at the age of 2 and 5 years.We did an assessment of maternal and paternal depressive symptoms (gestational week 32, as well as 3, 8 and 24 months postnatally) and children's emotional problems at ages two (N = 939) and five (N = 700) in the CHILD-SLEEP cohort. Three separate maternal and paternal depressive symptom trajectories based on latent profile analysis were combined to form four parental depressive symptom trajectory groups. We compared groups with a general linear model, with children's emotional (total, internalizing and externalizing) - problem scores serving as the dependent variables.At both ages, combined parental depressive symptom trajectories were associated with children's emotional problems: effect sizes were medium for total and small for other domains. According to post hoc comparisons, children whose mothers or both parents had persistent depressive symptoms had significantly more total, externalizing and internalizing problems than did children who had neither parent nor only the father showing depressive symptoms. A higher (and persistent) level of maternal depressive symptoms was related to a higher level of these children's emotional problems, a pattern not evident with paternal depressive symptoms. In all analyses, the interaction effect was nonsignificant between parental trajectories and child gender.Findings suggest that an absence of depressive symptoms in their fathers cannot compensate for the adverse effects of maternal depressive symptoms upon their children. Moreover, paternal depressive symptoms alone do not lead to increased risk for emotional problems in these 2- and 5-year-old children. In contrast, even subclinical levels of maternal depressive symptoms in late pregnancy are associated with increased risk for their children's experiencing internalizing and externalizing emotional problems.",21

Design and method: A nationally representative sample (N = 1622) of Israelis was assessed at three time points during a period of ongoing violence. PTG, resource loss, and the interaction between PTG and loss were examined as lagged predictors of PSS to test the proposed hypotheses. Results: Results were inconsistent with all three hypotheses, showing that PTG positively predicted subsequent PSS when accounting for main and interactive effects of loss. Conclusions: Our results suggest that self-reported PTG is a meaningful but counterintuitive predictor of poorer mental health following trauma.",21

One hundred forty-eight patients with moderate-severe TBI were assessed at 2, 5, 12, and ≥36 months post-injury on the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory. Clinical interviews obtained information about demographics, injury characteristics, and 1-year return to productivity. Latent growth mixture modeling identified trajectories of anxiety and depression across time. The three-step method identified predictors of trajectories, and χ2 analyses determined associations between trajectories and 1-year return to productivity. Analyses revealed that four-class models of anxiety and depression best fit the data. Most individuals had stable minimal (67%) or low (18%) levels of anxiety over time. Two other subsets of individuals were classified by anxiety that worsened rapidly (7%) or improved in the 1st year but worsened by 3 years post-injury (9%). Similarly for the depression trajectories, most individuals had stable minimal (70%) or low (10%) levels of depression over time. Others had depression that worsened rapidly (12%) or was delayed, with onset 1-year post-injury (8%). Predictors of worsening anxiety and depression included younger age, less education, and male gender. Those with worsening anxiety or depression were less likely to return to productivity by 1-year post-injury. There is a significant burden of anxiety (15%) and depression (20%) in the 3 years after moderate-severe TBI. Future research targeting at-risk patients may help to improve quality of life and functional recovery.",21

The current study identified trajectories of depression and alcohol use problems and predictors of those trajectories across the deployment cycle.National Guard soldiers (N = 1973) and spouses/intimate partners (N = 1020) completed assessments of risk/protective factors and baseline measures of mental health functioning 2 to 5 months prior to soldiers' 1-year deployments (Time 1) to Kuwait/Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn or Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Partners' mental health was reassessed at 4 months (Time 2) and 8 months (Time 3) after soldiers deployed, and both spouses/partners and soldiers were reassessed 2-3 months postdeployment (Time 4).Latent class growth modeling of partner depression symptoms over time revealed 4 groups: Resilience (79.9%), Deployment Distress (8.9%), Anticipatory Distress (8.4%), and Post-Deployment Distress (2.7%). Three alcohol misuse trajectories were identified: Resilience (91.3%), Deployment Onset (5.4%), and Deployment Desistance (3.3%). Predeployment predictors of partners' depression symptom trajectories varied by group and included soldier reports of stressors and social support and partner levels of neuroticism, introversion, disconstraint, and reported stressors. Predeployment predictors of alcohol misuse trajectories varied by group, and included soldier levels of alcohol misuse as well as partner neuroticism, disconstraint, and family readiness.Delineating and predicting trajectories of partner adjustment can allow for better targeted interventions toward those most at risk for heightened distress or alcohol problems over the deployment cycle.

Their theory predicts communal bereavement responses particularly in the setting of loss of essential state, religious, or economic institutions.To estimate the extent to which the September 11, 2001 attacks on the U.S. World Trade Center had a causal effect on psychological distress nationwide.We used a difference-in-differences framework applied to repeated cross-sectional data from more than 300,000 participants in the 2000 and 2001 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys. Psychological distress was measured using three questions eliciting days of poor mental health-related quality of life. The September 11 attacks served as our exposure of interest.The September 11 attacks had a statistically significant, adverse, causal effect on psychological distress nationally. Both the magnitude and statistical significance of the estimated effects were larger in the New York City region compared to the rest of the country. Our estimates were robust to probes of the parallel trends assumption and potential sources of selection bias, as well as to falsification tests. However, these effects had largely resolved within four weeks.Contrary to findings from the medical and public health literature, we conclude that the September 11 attacks did not have lasting effects on communal bereavement.",21

This study evaluated how disaster-related experiences before, during, and after Hurricane Irma were associated with mothers' health-risk behaviors, and the extent to which posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and depressive symptoms potentially mediated these relationships.Mothers (N = 534; 33% underrepresented minorities) residing in Southern Florida completed an online survey about their evacuation experiences before and hurricane experiences during and after Irma. Mothers also completed measures of PTSS, depressive symptoms, and health risk behaviors (i.e., substance use, sedentary behaviors, and difficulty falling or staying asleep). Confirmatory factor analysis assessed the fit of the health-risk behavior indicators on a latent factor. Structural equation modeling evaluated relationships between variables.A one-factor model for health risk behaviors fit the data well. After controlling for income, loss and disruption after the storm and depressive symptoms were directly associated with mothers' health risk behaviors. Before-the-storm evacuation stressors, actual life-threatening events during the storm, and loss and disruption after the storm were related to mothers' PTSS and depressive symptoms and also associated with health risk behaviors indirectly via depressive symptoms.Stressful experiences before, during, and after hurricanes are associated with mothers' health-risk behaviors via postevent emotional distress. Health interventions should include strategies that help parents cope with the impact of extreme weather events, both before and after such events occur. Mothers' distress potentially could affect child health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",21

The STEPS intervention was translated from Dutch to Danish and offered to adults in addition to adolescents as well as an individual intervention in addition to a group-based intervention at a Danish Centre for Rape Victims through 2011 to 2014. The programme was translated from Dutch to Danish and expanded to adults in addition to adolescents as well as to an individual intervention in addition to a group-based intervention at a Danish Centre for Rape Victims through 2011 to 2014.Objective: The present study observes development in trauma symptoms and ICD-11 diagnostic status during an adapted version of the intervention programme ‘STEPS’ for survivors of sexual assault.Methods: A prospective uncontrolled study was conducted, monitoring symptoms of posttraumatic stress and other trauma-related symptomatology before treatment, after treatment and at 6 and 12 months' follow up for 103 referrals receiving individual or group-based STEPS. Tentative diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD were assigned to participants according to the ICD-11 to observe the development in diagnostic status across time, and multilevel modelling was used to assess the development of symptom severity and to assess the moderating effect of age-group and mode of delivery.Results: A loglinear function representing large and statistically significant decline in symptomatology over time provided the best fit for all measures of trauma-related symptomatology. The decline was not moderated by age-group or mode of intervention. Dropout rates were independent of mode of intervention and age.Conclusion: The adaption of the STEPS programme to adults and as an individual intervention is feasible and maintains effect sizes comparable to those observed in the original intervention. Further research using randomized controlled trials is needed to ascribe the observed effect to the STEPS programme.",21

Materials and methods Participants comprised of 460 patients from several multinodal trauma centers in Bengaluru City, Karnataka, who had sustained facial injuries that had healed either with or without significant disfigurement or scarring and with visible/orthopedic injuries. One hundred and eleven patients of the chosen 460 had sustained nondisfiguring facial injuries while 153 patients sustained disfiguring facial injuries, 64 patients who sustained facial injury (i.e. 19.5%) were lost to follow-up and were not included in the study. One hundred and thirty-two had sustained orthopedic/visible injuries; however, in this group, 18 (i.e. 13.6%) patients were lost to follow-up and were excluded from the study. The impact of events scale (IES) was used to check the presence of PTSD. Results Statistically significant higher means of IES were present in patients with disfiguring facial injuries compared to nondisfiguring facial injuries, female patients compared to male patients, patients with disfiguring facial injuries compared to orthopedic/visible injuries and patients who were younger than 50 years of age compared to patients who were older than 50 years of age and the results observed were similar at all three study intervals (date of discharge (DOD), 1 month and 6 months postoperatively). Conclusion Patients with disfiguring facial injuries had significantly higher PTSD levels compared to patients with nondisfiguring facial injuries, patients with orthopedic/visible injuries had statistically significant lower IES scores which could not be strictly termed PTSD when compared to patients with disfiguring facial injuries who had high scores of IES corresponding to high levels of PTSD and these results were observed at all three study intervals (DOD, 1 and 6 months postoperatively). Female patients with disfiguring facial injuries had significantly higher PTSD levels compared to male patients (at all the study intervals) and patients younger than 50 years of age had significantly higher PTSD levels compared to older patients.

A parallel‐process latent growth model,"Using a parallel-process latent growth model (LGM), this study examined whether posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are associated with the trajectory of sleep disturbance (SD) and fatigue and whether the SD trajectory mediates the PTSS-fatigue relationship.Data were from 215 patients with breast cancer recruited from a tertiary hospital in South Korea. A self-report survey was administered at four time points during the course of adjuvant chemotherapy.The mean age of the participants was 46.69 (SD = 9.08) and the majority was at stage I and the average months since diagnosis was 1.33 (SD = 1.43). Unconditional parallel-process LGM indicated that SD and fatigue were positively associated with each other, both in terms of initial status and growth rate. Then, the conditional parallel-process LGM with baseline PTSS (i.e., avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal) as predictors were examined and anxiety, depressive symptoms and chronotype were entered as covariates in the model. Results indicated that a higher initial status and faster growth of SD were associated with a faster increase in fatigue. Greater baseline hyperarousal was directly related to a higher initial status and a slower increase in SD, and higher initial fatigue. Furthermore, a higher hyperarousal was associated with a greater initial SD, which was related to a faster increase in fatigue. Additionally, the late chronotype was related to a faster increase in fatigue through its impact on the initial SD.The detrimental impact of hyperarousal on the SD trajectory and fatigue suggests the need to intervene in PTSS and SD early and throughout the course of cancer treatments to prevent fatigue.",21

However, child in-hospital self-report of pretrauma symptoms may be impacted by their injury and associated medical care (e.g., sedation/pain medications). Parental report of child pretrauma risk factors may be easier to capture; however, mothers and fathers differ in the extent to which they report, and agree on, internalizing versus externalizing behaviors in their child. The present study examined the differential utility of maternal versus paternal ratings of child preinjury internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behaviors in predicting child PTSS 3- and 6-months postinjury. Eighty-four children were recruited from an emergency department after emergency medical services transport following injury, along with their parent(s). Dyadic (one parent and a child) analyses revealed that maternal reports of internalizing behaviors were significantly associated with child PTSS 3 months, F(5, 64) = 9.48, p < .001; ß = .44, p = .01, and 6 months, F(5, 48) = 5.57, p < .001; ß = .42, p = .03, postinjury. Paternal reports were not associated with child PTSS at either time point. In a subsample of triads (mother-father-child), mothers' and fathers' reports were only moderately correlated (rs = .30-.53), and neither maternal nor paternal ratings individually predicted child PTSS when both parents' reports were included in the model. Exploratory analyses revealed that family conflict and maternal initial PTSS moderated the relationship between maternal ratings of internalizing behaviors and child 3-month PTSS. Results suggest that maternal reports of child preinjury internalizing behaviors should be considered as predictors of later child PTSS development.

to explore the types and severity of the traumatic experiences, and to estimate the prevalence
rate of post-traumatic events.
Method: The target population consisted of 319 adolescents ages 12 to 18 years with mean
age of 14.97 (SD=2.01). They were 163 boys (51.1%) and 156 girls (48.9%). Adolescents were
interviewed with Life Events Checklist, Traumatic Events Checklist, and Post-traumatic Stress
Disorder Reaction Index.
Results: The study showed that 58.3% reported life stressors, mean stressors was 4.07. Boys
significantly reported more life stressors than girls. Mean traumatic events reported was 3.7.
Boys report more traumatic events than girls.
The study results showed that 29.5% had partial post-traumatic stress disorder and 23.5% had
full criteria of post-traumatic stress disorder. Total stressors and traumatic events reported by
children were strongly correlated, stressors were correlated to total with post-traumatic stress
disorder, and re-experiencing, total stressors were strongly correlated with reexperiencing,
numbness, hyperarousal, and dissociative symptoms. Also total traumatic events total were
strongly correlated with post-traumatic stress disorder, re-experiencing, avoidance, numbness,
hyperarousal, and dissociative symptoms.
Conclusion: In conclusion, our data support the importance of early detection and treatment of
children experiencing psychological distress after war exposure, as this may prevent problems
in adulthood. Further, life events contributed to persistent stress, through the erosion of social
support, and also directly. Clinicians should focus on efforts to help youth manage stressors
effectively, either via social support or with other strategies.",21

This study assessed the natural course of daily alcohol consumption and weekly changes in PTSD symptoms in 112 recent combat veterans over the course of 11 months. Latent class growth mixture modeling was used to classify individuals into distinct classes with similar PTSD symptom and alcohol use growth trajectories. We then investigated theorized predictors of class membership including sociodemographics; pre‐, peri‐, and postdeployment factors; coping; symptom severity; and number of mental health/substance use appointments attended. Results revealed that most participants had severe and nonremitting PTSD. Trajectories for alcohol use included gradual and drastic declines, and chronic low‐level drinking. The use of behavioral health services (odds ratio = 2.47) and fewer current stressors (odds ratio = 0.42) predicted AUD remission. Because little variation was observed in the PTSD course, our study did not observe coordinated fluctuations of PTSD symptoms and heavy drinking. Our findings suggest that treatment impacts the course of AUD and that recent combat veterans who do not seek PTSD treatment may have chronic and severe PTSD symptoms.",22

Results: The results showed that the most common traumatic events due to war on 2009 reported by children were hearing shelling of the area by artillery, hearing the sonic sounds of jetfighters, watching mutilated bodies on TV, and hearing shootings and bombardment. Mean Impact of Events Scale was 18.37, intrusion subscale mean was 8.98, avoidance subscale mean was 9.49, 148 children were in the clinical range for post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (59%). Study showed that 21.9% of children had anxiety and 50.6% had depression. Total traumatic events were significantly correlated PTSD, avoidance, arousal symptoms, anxiety, and depression.
Clinical implications: The findings showed that political violence due to war trauma is related to the development of PTSD and depression in Palestinian children in Gaza Strip.
Different levels of programs and interventions had to be described; such interventions under extremely adverse circumstances can be put in place after children’s basic needs have been met. This is because existing emergency aid agencies have already responded to the local infrastructure in specialized and culturally appropriate ways and so can serve as a channel for the provision of additional services.",22

It has been theorized that the psychological impact of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict extends beyond the bounds of psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Exposure to the ongoing conflict may lead to changes in the way Israelis and Palestinians think, feel, and act; while these changes may not meet the thresholds of PTSD or depression, they nonetheless could have a strong public health impact. It is unclear whether existing studies have found associations between exposure to the conflict and nonclinical psychological outcomes. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the empirical research on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its psychological consequences. As a whole, the body of literature we reviewed suggests that exposure to regional political conflict and violence may have detrimental effects on psychological well-being and that these effects likely extend beyond the psychiatric disorders and symptoms most commonly studied. We found evidence that exposure to the conflict informs not only the way Israelis and Palestinians think, feel, and act but also their attitudes toward different religious and ethnic groups and their degree of support for peace or war. We also found that Palestinians may be at particularly high risk of experiencing psychological distress as a result of the conflict, though more research is needed to determine the extent to which this is due to socioeconomic stress. Our review suggests the need for more studies on the nonclinical psychological aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as for longitudinal studies on the impact of the conflict on both Israelis and Palestinians.",22

Assessment took place prior to and 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after deployment. Data were collected between 2005 and 2011. The fatigue severity subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength was used to indicate the level of fatigue during the previous 2 weeks. Mixed models and logistic regression analysis were used to predict course and prevalence of fatigue after deployment. Predictors of postdeployment fatigue were assessed prior to deployment.Results: The mean level of fatigue increased significantly following deployment (B = 0.58, P = .007). In total, 274 soldiers (30.2%) were severely fatigued at least once after deployment and 130 (14.3%) soldiers had recurrent levels of severe fatigue. Only a minority of the veterans with severe fatigue could be classified as having posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, per DSM-IV-TR criteria) or potential medical problems. Significant predeployment predictors of less favorable courses of fatigue after deployment were higher levels of fatigue (B = 0.46, P ≤ .001), emotional abuse during childhood (B = 0.99, P ≤ .001), and harm avoidance (B = 0.27, P = .012). These predeployment factors also predicted severe fatigue after deployment.Conclusions: Severe fatigue is a substantial problem in Afghanistan War veterans that does not seem to resolve over time. In a majority of cases, the symptoms cannot be attributed to medical problems or PTSD, whereas predeployment differences in psychosocial factors partially explain course and prevalence of postdeployment fatigue. These findings support assumptions that a complex interplay of various factors might be responsible for the symptoms.",22

The aim of the present study was to examine the course of PTS up to three years after losing relatives in the MS Estonia ferry disaster, one of the worst maritime disasters in modern times.Seven postal surveys were sent out over three years post-disaster. The respondents were invited and added consecutively during the three years and 938 relatives participated in one or more of the surveys, representing 89% of the MS Estonia's Swedish victims. The survey included the Impact of Event Scale (IES) to measure PTS. Latent growth curve modeling was used to analyze PTS over time.The majority of bereaved individuals had high levels of PTS. At three years post-loss, 62% of the respondents scored above the recommended cut-off value on the IES. Over time, PTS symptoms declined, but initially high symptoms of PTS were associated with a slower recovery rate.The present finding suggests that being an indirectly-exposed disaster-bereaved close-relative can lead to very high levels of PTS which are sustained for several years.",22

METHODS: We used data from the Gulf Coast Child and Family Health Study, a longitudinal cohort displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The exposure of interest was the number of additional natural disasters the respondent had experienced. Child psychological distress was based on their caregiver endorsing one of the following in the past month: feeling sad or depressed; having problems sleeping; feeling nervous or afraid; or having problems getting along with other children. We conducted bivariate analyses followed by logistic regression, evaluating moderation by race; annual household income; parental educational attainment; household financial constraints; stable housing; family functioning; parental coping; and parental mental component score. RESULTS:Among 141 respondents with children, about 28% reported their children having psychological distress in the past month. Those respondents whose children had psychological distress experienced over twice the number of disasters, on average, than those without psychological distress (0.45 [SD 0.86] vs. 1.10 [SD 1.64]). None of the sociodemographic, vulnerability, or resilience variables significantly moderated the association between additional disaster exposure and child/adolescent psychological distress. Each additional disaster experienced by a respondent was associated with a 90% increase in the odds that his/her child exhibited symptoms of psychological distress (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.01, 3.55). Those whose caregivers reported coping somewhat or not well at all with parenting responsibilities were over three times more likely to have psychological distress (OR 3.33; 0.11; 0.93) than those whose caregivers were coping very well. Children and adolescents in high functioning families were also significantly less likely than children in low functioning families to exhibit symptoms (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.11, 0.93). CONCLUSIONS:These results demonstrate the persistent effects of exposure to natural disasters on child/adolescent psychological distress.

Examining patient reported outcomes up to 20 years after burn injury—A Burn Model System National Database investigation,"People living with burn injury often face long-term physical and psychological sequelae associated with their injuries. Few studies have examined the impacts of burn injuries on long-term health and function, life satisfaction, and community integration beyond 5 years postinjury. The purpose of this study was to examine these outcomes up to 20 years after burn injury.Data from the Burn Model System National Longitudinal Database (1993-2020) were analyzed. Patient-reported outcome measures were collected at discharge (preinjury status recall) and 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and 20 years after injury. Outcomes examined were the SF-12/VR-12 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Community Integration Questionnaire. Trajectories were developed using linear mixed models with repeated measures of outcome scores over time, controlling for demographic and clinical variables.The study population included 421 adult burn survivors with a mean age of 42.4 years. Lower Physical Component Summary scores (worse health) were associated with longer length of hospital stay, older age at injury and greater time since injury. Similarly, lower Mental Component Summary scores were associated with longer length of hospital stay, female sex, and greater time since injury. Satisfaction with Life Scale scores decrease negatively over time. Lower Community Integration Questionnaire scores were associated with burn size and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity.Burn survivors' physical and mental health and satisfaction with life worsened over time up to 20 years after injury. Results strongly suggest that future studies should focus on long-term follow-up where clinical interventions may be necessary.Prognostic and Epidemiologic; Level III.",22

Across two studies, we assess predictors of the development of PTSD in young children (PTSD-YC), including the adult-led acute stress disorder (ASD) diagnosis, and provide proof of principle for cognitive-focused therapy for this age range, with the aim of increasing treatment options for children diagnosed with PTSD-YC.Study 1 (N = 105) assessed ASD and PTSD-YC diagnosis in 3- to 8-year-old children within one month and at around three months following attendance at an emergency room. Study 2 (N = 37) was a preregistered (www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN35018680) randomized controlled early-phase trial comparing CBT-3M, a cognitive-focused intervention, to treatment-as-usual (TAU) delivered within the UK NHS to 3- to 8-year-olds diagnosed with PTSD-YC.In Study 1, the ASD diagnosis failed to identify any young children. In contrast, prevalence of acute PTSD-YC (minus the duration requirement) was 8.6% in the first month post-trauma and 10.1% at 3 months. Length of hospital stay, but no other demographic or trauma-related characteristics, predicted development of later PTSD-YC. Early (within one month) diagnosis of acute PTSD-YC had a positive predictive value of 50% for later PTSD-YC. In Study 2, most children lost their PTSD-YC diagnosis following completion of CBT-3M (84.6%) relative to TAU (6.7%) and CBT-3M was acceptable to recipient families. Effect sizes were also in favor of CBT-3M for secondary outcome measures.The ASD diagnosis is not fit for purpose in this age-group. There was a strong and encouraging signal of putative efficacy for young children treated using a cognitive-focused treatment for PTSD, and a larger trial of CBT-3M is now warranted.",22

For decades, developmental researchers have documented resilient outcomes in children exposed to chronic maltreatment who nonetheless thrived. Relatively more recently the study of resilience has migrated to the investigation of acute and potentially traumatic life events (PTE) in adults. We first consider some of the key differences in the conceptualization of resilience following chronic adversity versus resilience following single‐incident traumas, and then describe some of the misunderstandings that have developed about these constructs. We describe the terms emergent resilience and minimal‐impact resilience (Bonanno &amp; Diminich, 2013) to represent trajectories of positive adjustment in these two domains, respectively. In particular, we focus on minimal‐impact resilience, and review recent advances in the literature. We then briefly discuss the most widely researched factors (e.g., age, gender, personality) suggested to influence resilient outcomes following exposure to PTEs. In closing, we suggest future areas of research to further expand the study of resilience within the social sciences.",22

Experiences of trauma are commonly seen in this population, which may give rise to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, including intrusion, avoidance, negative cognition and mood, and affective arousal. While past research has demonstrated a significant relation between PTSD symptoms and parenting stress, no studies have examined the relative contributions of these symptoms to parenting stress in mothers engaged in substance use treatment.Seventy-four mothers attending outpatient substance use treatment who were parenting children aged 0-3 years completed measures of parenting stress, PTSD, substance use, and depression symptoms.A canonical correlation analysis indicated two canonical variates accounting for significant variance between PTSD symptom clusters and parenting stress measures. The first canonical variate, primarily reflecting depressive and PTSD cognition and mood symptoms, was predominantly related to the parental distress aspect of parenting stress (40%). The second canonical variate, primarily reflecting intrusion and avoidance PTSD symptoms, was associated with increased parental perceptions of their child as difficult (10%).Future research directions and clinical implications of these results are discussed for designing parenting interventions with mothers attending substance use treatment who present with PTSD symptoms.",23
https://openalex.org/W2801595699,10.1002/jts.22274,The Influence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder on Health Functioning in Active‐Duty Military Service Members,"Abstract Researchers have suggested that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with significant healthcare burden and utilization of medical services. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of PTSD symptoms on health functioning among active‐duty military personnel. Participants in the study were 366 treatment‐seeking service members who had returned from deployment and were participating in a larger PTSD treatment study. Assessments included measures of PTSD symptom severity, combat experiences, life stress, health functioning, alcohol use, and depression. We hypothesized that at baseline, PTSD severity and its symptom clusters would be significantly associated with poorer physical and mental health functioning. We conducted separate hierarchical multiple regressions to examine the predictive contribution the hypothesized factors would have on the variance in physical and mental health scores. Consistent with previous literature, we found that PTSD severity was significantly associated with poorer mental health functioning, B = −0.25, SE = 0.08, β = −0.15, t (342) = −3.07, R 2 = .37, p = .002; however, contrary to our hypotheses, PTSD severity was not associated with poorer physical health functioning. Further, the hyperarousal symptom cluster was significantly associated with poorer physical health functioning, B = −0.83, SE = 0.26, β = −0.18, t (340) = −3.16, R 2 = .11, p = .002, but not mental health functioning. Limitations of our study included the use of self‐report measures only and lack of objective measures. Future directions for study include examination of how health functioning perceptions change over a longer duration of PTSD symptoms and after treatment.",23

At one year post-injury, 882 adult civilians who received inpatient rehabilitation for moderate-severe TBI self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). The severity of TBI was characterized acutely by the duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), and TBI-related functional disability was rated by an examiner at one year post-injury using a structured interview (Glasgow Outcome Scale – Extended). We estimated two cross-sectional, partial correlation networks. In the first network, anxiety and depressive symptoms were densely interconnected yet formed three distinct, data-driven communities: Hyperarousal, Depression, and General Distress. Worrying thoughts and having difficulty relaxing were amongst the most central symptoms, showing strong connections with other symptoms within and between communities. In the second network, TBI severity was directly negatively associated with hyperarousal symptoms but indirectly positively associated with depressive symptoms via greater functional disability. The results highlight the potential utility of simultaneous, transdiagnostic assessment and treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms after moderate-severe TBI. Worrying thoughts, having difficulty relaxing, and the experience of disability may be important targets for treatment, although future studies examining symptoms within individuals and over time are required.",23

Participants completed an affective Go/No-Go task (GNG) with different emotional contexts (threat, reward, and a multidimensional threat/reward condition) and current PTSD, trait disinhibition, and risky/self-destructive behavior measures. PTSD interacted with trait disinhibition to explain recent engagement in risky/self-destructive behavior, with Veterans scoring high on trait disinhibition and current PTSD symptoms reporting the highest levels of these behaviors. On the GNG task, commission errors were also associated with the interaction of PTSD symptoms and trait disinhibition. Specifically, PTSD symptoms were associated with greater commission errors in threat vs. reward contexts for individuals who were low on trait disinhibition. In contrast, veterans high on PTSD and trait disinhibition exhibited the greatest number of commission errors in the multidimensional affective context that involved both threat and reward processing. Results highlight the interactive effects of PTSD and disinhibited personality traits, as well as threat and reward systems, as risk factors for impulsive and self-destructive behavior in trauma-exposed groups. Findings have clinical implications for understanding heterogeneity in the expression of PTSD and its association with disinhibited behavior.",23

It did so by investigating the association between six consequent variables (personal injury, loss of home, loss of business, death of a family member, injury to a family member, or loss of a family member's business) and mental health, as measured by the 36‐item Short Form Health Survey (SF‐36), among residents in four provinces of Thailand. One year later, participants who suffered a personal injury, the loss of a business, or the loss of a family member reported poorer mental health than those who were unaffected. Two years later, participants who experienced the loss of a family member reported poorer mental health than those who were unaffected. This research shows that such a disaster may have long‐lasting ramifications for mental health, and that diverse losses may influence mental health differently.",23

Lifetime psychiatric history and current PTSD severity and funxctioning were assessed.Five trajectories of PTSD response were noted across the 6 years: (a) chronic (4%), (b) recovery (6%), (c) worsening/recovery (8%), (d) worsening (10%) and (e) resilient (73%). A poorer trajectory was predicted by female gender, recent life stressors, presence of mild traumatic brain injury and admission to intensive care unit.These findings demonstrate the long-term PTSD effects that can occur following traumatic injury. The different trajectories highlight that monitoring a subset of patients over time is probably a more accurate means of identifying PTSD rather than relying on factors that can be assessed during hospital admission.",23

As a follow-up, we examined the impact of pre- and postdisaster social support on longer-term of mental health—both psychological distress and posttraumatic stress. In this three-wave longitudinal study, 492 residents in the region affected by Hurricane Katrina reported levels of perceived social support and symptoms of psychological distress prior to the storm (Wave 1). Subsequently, one year after Hurricane Katrina (Wave 2), they reported levels of exposure, perceived social support, and symptoms of psychological distress and posttraumatic stress. The latter three variables were assessed again four years after the hurricane (Wave 3). Results of mediation analysis indicated that levels of exposure to hurricane-related stressors mediated the relationship between Wave 1 perceived social support and Wave 3 psychological distress as well as postdisaster posttraumatic stress. Results of regression analyses indicated that, controlling for Wave 1 psychological distress and disaster exposure, Wave 2 perceived social support was associated with Wave 2 and Wave 3 psychological distress but not posttraumatic stress. Our results confirmed the social causation processes of social support and suggest that posttraumatic stress might not stem directly from the lack of social support. Rather, preexisting deficits in social resources might indirectly affect longer-term posttraumatic stress and general psychological distress by increasing risk for disaster-related stressors.",23

The current study sought to examine the associations between primary and secondary exposure to community violence and the moderating role of parent and friend support on these relations. Participants were 96 urban youths (aged 6–17 years; 58.4% racial/ethnic minority; 51% female) and a caregiver recruited from a university mental health clinic. Results indicated that both primary and secondary exposure to community violence predicted PTSD symptoms. Friend support, but not parent support, moderated the association between primary, but not secondary, exposure to community violence and PTSD symptoms. The findings suggest that friend support is a salient protective factor for urban youth who may be at risk of PTSD symptoms due to exposure to community violence.",24

Methods: Participants (N=658) were part of a three-wave, population-based study of Hurricane Ike survivors. At each wave, participants were asked whether they perceived having a need for mental health services, for example, information about stress reactions and medication for emotional problems. Those with perceived need were asked about use of eight services, such as a psychiatrist or physician, to address needs. Generalized estimating equations examined predisposing, illness-related, and enabling factors as predictors of service use among participants with perceived need (N=304). Results: More general stressors (predisposing factor) and insurance coverage (enabling factor) predicted service use among participants with perceived need. Conclusions: The results suggest that expanded access to services that do not require insurance coverage could better address survivors’ mental health needs after a disaster.",24

One thousand one hundred and ninety-seven refugees residing in Turkey and Sweden participated in the research. They completed the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the General Health Questionnaire-28. Forty-three percent of refugees met the cutoff for PTSD. After adjusting for location of residence, witnessing horror and exposure to life threat and assault were significantly correlated with PTSD and psychiatric co-morbidity respectively. Death of, or life threat to family members or friends were significantly correlated with both distress outcomes. Refugees residing in Turkey had significantly higher levels of PTSD, psychiatric co-morbidity and trauma characteristics than those living in Sweden. To conclude, Syrian refugees who witnessed horror, life threat or had family or friends die, tended to have elevated psychological distress. Levels of distress among resettled refugees can vary depending on country of resettlement. We recommend systematic mental health screening and implementation of psychotherapeutic interventions to address issues pertaining to subjective experience of resettlement and trauma exposure for Syrian refugees.",24

Latent transition analysis was then used to examine individuals' probabilities of transitioning into each latent class at Time 2 based on their latent class membership at Time 1.A four-class model emerged as the best fitting model at both Time 1 and Time 2. Classes demonstrated overall severity and symptom cluster severity differences. Transition into a lower severity class was more common than transition into a higher severity class, though escalation was demonstrated by 6-20% of participants in each latent class.The substantial heterogeneity in sexual assault survivors' PTSD symptoms highlights the variety of ways that posttraumatic stress may be experienced years after a sexual assault. Future research should explore factors that affect long-term symptoms, including cumulative lifetime trauma and social support. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",24

The study of PTSD is complicated by highly heterogeneous presentations and experiences of trauma between individuals. Capitalizing on the existence of the World Trade Center General Responder Cohort (WTC-GRC) of rescue, recovery and clean-up workers who responded during and in the aftermath of the World Trade Center (WTC) 9/11/2001 attacks, we studied genetic correlates of PTSD in a sample of 371 WTC responders, selected from the WTC-GRC utilizing stratified random sampling. This deeply phenotyped sample of WTC responders – ranging from no/low PTSD symptom levels to severe PTSD– provide a unique opportunity to study genetic risk factors for PTSD severity and chronicity following a single, shared, well-documented trauma, also incorporating measures of childhood and other lifetime traumas. We examined associations of polygenic risk scores (PRS) –derived from a range of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of behavioral traits, psychiatric disorders, and brain volumetric phenotypes– with PTSD severity and chronicity among these 371 individuals. Our results demonstrate significant genetic regulation of lifetime PTSD severity, assessed with the lifetime version Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), and chronicity, assessed with the past-month CAPS. PRS derived from GWAS of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and brain imaging phenotypes (amygdala and putamen volumes) were associated with several PTSD symptom dimensions. Interestingly, we found greater genetic contribution to PTSD among cases compared to our full sample. In addition, we tested for associations between exposures to traumatic stressors, including WTC-related exposures, childhood trauma, and other lifetime traumatic life events in our full sample. Together, polygenic risk and exposures to traumatic stress explained ~45% of variance in lifetime CAPS (R 2 =0.454), and ~48% of variance in past-month CAPS (R 2 =0.480) in the full sample. These participants represent a highly vulnerable population, with exposures to severe trauma during 9/11 and the following days and months. These novel identified associations between PTSD and PRS of behavioral traits and brain volume phenotypes, as well as replicated associations with PRS of other psychiatric disorders, may contribute to understanding the biological factors associated with risk for and chronicity of PTSD. In particular, the identification of neuroimaging phenotypes indicates that coupling of neuroimaging with genetic risk score calculations may predict PTSD outcomes.",24

There are few controlled trials for PTSD in this population, and none report longer term effects of treatment. This study evaluated the benefits of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel who received either brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories or prolonged exposure (CBT-L) 2 years following treatment.One hundred emergency service personnel with PTSD were randomized to CBT-L, CBT-B, or Wait-List (WL). Following posttreatment assessment, WL participants were randomized to an active treatment. Participants randomized to CBT-L or CBT-B were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, 6-month, and 2-year follow-up. Both CBT conditions involved 12 weekly individual sessions comprising education, CBT skills building, imaginal exposure, in vivo exposure, cognitive restructuring, and relapse prevention. Reliving trauma memories occurred for 40 min per session in CBT-L and for 10 min in CBT-B.At the 2-year follow-up, there were no differences in PTSD severity (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale) between CBT-L and CBT-B. There were very large effect sizes for CBT-L (1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90-1.64) and CBT-B (1.28, 95% CI = 0.05-1.63) from baseline to 2-year follow-up.This study highlights that CBT can be an effective treatment of PTSD in emergency service personnel using either prolonged or brief periods of reliving the trauma memory, and that these benefits can last for at least 2 years after treatment.",24

With revisions to the DSM, it is important to understand how overall PTSD symptoms and the new symptom clusters relate to substance use among Reserve/Guard soldiers—a high risk group. Methods Data are from the baseline assessment of Operation: SAFETY (Soldiers and Families Excelling Through the Years), a longitudinal study of US Army Reserve/National Guard (USAR/NG) soldiers ( N = 389 males, N = 84 females). We examined associations between current substance use (drug use, hazardous drinking, and smoking) and overall PTSD symptoms, and symptom clusters. Additionally, we examined PTSD by sex interactions. Results Greater overall PTSD symptoms were associated with higher odds of drug use (OR = 1.08; 95%CI: 1.05, 1.12) and hazardous drinking (OR = 1.04; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.07). Greater individual symptom cluster scores were associated with higher odds of drug use ( p s &lt; .001) and hazardous drinking ( p s &lt; .01). Interaction models revealed no differences in these associations on the basis sex ( p s &gt; .05). There were no associations between PTSD symptoms or symptom clusters on smoking ( p s &gt; .05). Discussion and Conclusion Soldiers experiencing PTSD symptoms are reporting current drug and hazardous alcohol use, suggestive of self‐medication. Scientific Significance It is imperative to consider the impact of PTSD on substance use broadly, as this work shows that overall symptoms and symptom clusters have an impact on male and female USAR/NG soldiers.

The study sample consisted of 520 Palestinian adults selected using online tools. The findings of the study revealed that posttraumatic stress symptoms positively correlated with suicidal ideations (r = .32, p < .01), and negatively correlated with social support (r = -.34, p < .01), spirituality (r = -.16, p < .05) and mindfulness (r = -.72, p < .01), whereas suicidal ideations negatively correlated with social support (r = -.46, p < .01), spirituality(r = -.27, p < .01) and mindfulness (r = -.72, p < .01). Results of the path analysis showed that social support, spirituality and mindfulness mediated the association between posttraumatic stress symptoms and suicidal ideations. Developing intervention programs to enhance social support, mindfulness and spirituality to mitigate the effect of ongoing traumatic experiences among Palestinians is crucial to reducing suicidal ideations. Further studies are also recommended to investigate the role of potentially protective factors that may reduce suicidal ideations and appropriate techniques to deal effectively with traumatic and stressful events.",24

https://openalex.org/W2774986320,,Cognitive & Behavioral Assessment Cognitive impairment among World Trade Center responders: Long-term implications of re-experiencing the 9/11 terrorist attacks,"Introduction: During the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks, responders who helped in search, rescue, and recovery endured multiple traumatic and toxic exposures. One-fifth subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD has been linked to dementia in veterans. This study examined the association between WTC-related PTSD and cognitive impairment (CI) in WTC responders. Methods: A one-third sample of responders (N 5 818) reporting for annual monitoring visits were screened for cognitive impairment and dementia using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment from January 2014‐April 2015. Concurrent diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder (MDD), as well as serial PTSD and depressive symptom inventories, collected since 2002, were examined in relation to current CI. Results: Approximately 12.8% and 1.2% of responders in this sample respectively had scores indicative of CI and possible dementia. Current PTSD and MDD were associated with CI. Longitudinal results revealed that re-experiencing symptoms were consistently associated with CI (aRR 5 2.88, 95% confidence interval 5 1.35‐6.22), whereas longitudinal increases in other PTSD and depressive symptoms in the years before screening were evident only among those with CI. Conclusions: Analyses replicated results from Veterans studies and further highlighted the importance of re-experiencing symptoms, a major component of PTSD that was consistently predictive of CI 14 years later. Clinicians should monitor CI when treating individuals with chronic PTSD. 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the Alzheimer’s Association.

Despite higher rates of both PTSD and hazardous alcohol use among military combat veterans than civilians, scant research has examined whether military combat experience is associated with drinking alcohol to cope with PTSD symptoms. This study tested the hypothesis that compared to trauma-exposed men without combat experience, men with military combat experience would be more likely to endorse drinking alcohol to cope with their PTSD symptoms. Methods: Interview data from N = 11,474 men who reported at least one lifetime traumatic experience were drawn from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a face-to-face interview study that recruited a nationally representative sample of adults living in the United States between 2004 and 2005. Results: Among men endorsing lifetime trauma exposure, men with military combat experience (n = 1,386) were more likely than men without combat experience (n = 10,088) to report drinking alcohol to cope (7.22 vs. 2.61% in unweighted analyses, 6.46 vs. 2.37% in weighted analyses). Total number of lifetime trauma types, lifetime PTSD severity, and lifetime alcohol abuse/dependence were significantly associated with drinking to cope in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Military combat experience was significantly associated with drinking to cope in multivariate analyses adjusting for lifetime PTSD diagnosis. Military combat experience was not significantly associated with drinking to cope in multivariate analyses adjusting for lifetime PTSD symptom count. Conclusions: Although military combat experience was significantly associated with drinking to cope in bivariate analyses, multivariate analyses yielded mixed findings: combat experience was significantly associated with drinking to cope in models adjusting for PTSD diagnosis, but not in models adjusting for PTSD symptom count. Findings highlight the importance of assessing and targeting PTSD symptom-related alcohol use, even in the absence of alcohol abuse/dependence. Results from this preliminary study could inform future research on drinking to cope with PTSD symptoms among military combat veterans and other trauma survivors.",25
https://openalex.org/W3203229413,10.3389/fpsyt.2021.682055,Model of Post-traumatic Growth in Newly Traumatized vs. Retraumatized Adolescents,"Background: In our analysis of adolescents affected by the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, we observed many negative mental health effects in individuals with a prior history of psychological trauma. Elevated rates of depression and markers of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were observed, consistent with the hypothesis that prior trauma may reduce sensitivity thresholds for later psychopathology (stress sensitization). Surprisingly, levels of anxiety did not differ based on prior trauma history, nor were retraumatized individuals at increased risk for recent (past month) suicidal ideation. These results are more suggestive of inoculation by prior trauma than stress sensitization. This led us to consider whether individuals with a prior trauma history showed evidence of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG), a condition in which the experience of a previous trauma leads to areas of sparing or even improvement. Method: To investigate this issue, we generated a structural equation model (SEM) exploring the role of anxiety in previously traumatized (n = 295) and wildfire trauma alone (n = 740) groups. Specifically, models were estimated to explore the relationship between hopelessness, anxiety, PTSD symptoms, self-efficacy and potential protective factors such as friend and family support in both groups. The model was tested using a cross-sectional sample of affected youth, comparing effects between the two groups. Results: While both models produced relatively good fit, differences in the effects and chi-squared values led us to conclude that the groups are subject to different causal specifications in a number of areas, although details warrant caution pending additional investigation. Discussion: We found that adolescents with a prior trauma history appear to have a more realistic appraisal of potential difficulties associated with traumatic events, and seem less reactive to potentially unsettling PTSD symptoms. They also seemed less prone to overconfidence as they got older, an effect seen in the adolescents without a history of trauma. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that the construct of anxiety may work differently in newly traumatized and retraumatized individuals, particularly in the context of mass trauma events.",25

Most people who experience such events recover from it; however, people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) continue to be severely depressed and anxious for several months or even years following the event. Palestinians are particularly at a higher risk for developing anxiety disorders and PTSD due to the continuous exposure to political violence, prolonged displacement, and other limitation on professional, educational, financial opportunities, and mental health services. This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the literature and established studies concerning Anxiety disorders besides PTSD in Palestine. Methods PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar was used to search for materials for the critical analysis of empirical articles. The following aspects were taken into consideration: study type, sample, and key findings. Results In this review, we included about twenty-four studies from Palestine (West Bank and Gaza). Five studies relate to children, five relate to adolescents, three relate to women, three relate to physical diseases, and four relate to gender and age differences. Results show that anxiety disorders and PTSD are one of the most common mental disorders in Palestine. Anxiety and PTSD develop from a complex set of risk factors, including genetics, personality, and life events. They are mostly associated with low quality of life and disability. The results indicate that a significant proportion of Palestinian experiencing serious issues that deal with several challenges, distinct barriers including; inconsistent availability of medications, absence of multidisciplinary teamwork, insufficient specialists, fragmented mental health system, and occupation. Conclusion As primary prevention, the occupation has to have considered as the main source of anxiety and other mental health disorders in Palestine. Besides, there is a need to implement a mental health care system through multidisciplinary work and raising awareness regarding the prevalence of mental disorders.",25

Correlational analysis was used to examine associations between variables. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the most valuable predictors of resilience.Resilience was correlated with neurobehavioral symptoms of TBI, post-traumatic stress symptoms, quality of life, cognitive performance, and positive affect. There were no significant correlations with socio-demographic variables, TBI characteristics, depression, anxiety, and negative affect. Multiple linear regression showed that cognitive performance and positive affect were the most valuable predictors, followed by neurobehavioral symptoms and post-traumatic stress.Resilience in veterans with TBI has a strong correlation with persistent neurobehavioral symptoms, posttraumatic stress, quality of life, cognitive functioning, and positive affect. Such variables as good cognitive performance and positive affect were found to be more valuable for effective resilience in veterans with persistent TBI symptoms (possibly as protective factors) than clinical type of traumatic brain injury, the amount or the time that had passed since their last trauma and can explain the great amount of resilience variance even after excluding all other variables. Unlike many other factors, these variables can be modified. Targeting them in specific interventions will possibly cultivate resilience.",25

We tested whether PTSD moderated the course of symptom change using mixed models analyses and if ED diagnosis, ADM BMI, age of ED onset and LGBTQ + orientation were significant covariates of change. Number of days between ADM and FU was used as a weighting measure.Despite sustained improvements with RT in the total group, the PTSD group had significantly higher scores on all measures at all time points (p ≤ .001). Patients with (n = 261) and without PTSD (n = 348) showed similar symptom improvements from ADM to DC and outcomes remained statistically improved at 6-month FU compared to ADM. The only significant worsening observed between DC and FU was with MDD symptoms, yet all measures remained significantly lower than ADM at FU (p ≤ .001). There were no significant PTSD by time interactions for any of the measures. Age of ED onset was a significant covariate in the EDI-2, PHQ-9, STAI-T, and EDQOL models such that an earlier age of ED onset was associated with a worse outcome. ADM BMI was also a significant covariate in the EDE-Q, EDI-2, and EDQOL models, such that higher ADM BMI was associated with a worse ED and quality of life outcome.Integrated treatment approaches that address PTSD comorbidity can be successfully delivered in RT and are associated with sustained improvements at FU. Improving strategies to prevent post-DC recurrence of MDD symptoms is an important and challenging area of future work.Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in patients with eating disorders and is associated with higher severity of symptoms and worse outcomes. However, this has not been studied extensively in patients admitted to higher levels of care, such as residential treatment. Using an integrated clinical approach based upon principles of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and other evidence-based treatments, we studied outcomes at discharge and 6 months following discharge in 609 patients [96% female; mean age (± SD) = 26.0 ± 8.8 years; 22% LGBTQ +] with and without PTSD. All patients improved significantly and remained improved at follow-up compared to admission. However, all measured symptoms, including those of eating disorder, major depression, and state and trait anxiety, and a measure of quality of life, were worse in patients with PTSD at every time point (admission, discharge, and follow-up). The only significant worsening observed was for symptoms of major depression between discharge and follow-up. In conclusion, integrated treatment approaches that address PTSD and related problems can be successfully delivered in residential treatment and are associated with sustained improvements at 6 months following discharge. Improving strategies to prevent post-discharge recurrence of depressive symptoms is an important and challenging area of future work.",25

Factor analysis and latent class analysis determined, respectively, the factorial and the syndromic distinctiveness of grief, PTSD, and MDD.Four types of evidence supporting the distinctiveness of grief emerged. (1) Bereavement was associated with grief independently of PTSD and MDD, but not with PTSD and MDD after adjusting for grief; conversely, non-loss related trauma was associated primarily with PTSD. (2) Grief contributed uniquely to functional impairment. (3) Grief reactions loaded on a separate factor. (4) Youth with elevated grief reactions fell into two classes characterized by only moderate and negligible probability of co-occurring PTSD and MDD symptoms, respectively.A multifaceted approach provided convergent evidence that grief reactions are independent of other common types of postdisaster child and adolescent psychopathology, and capture a unique aspect of bereavement-related distress. These findings suggest that grief reactions in traumatically bereaved youth merit separate clinical attention, informing tailored interventions.",25

Screening could help predict those at greatest risk and provide an opportunity for monitoring so that early intervention may be provided. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Screening Tool for Early Predictors of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (STEPP) in a mixed-trauma sample in a non-English speaking country (the Netherlands).Children aged 8-18 and one of their parents were recruited in two academic level I trauma centers. The STEPP was assessed in 161 children (mean age 13.9 years) and 156 parents within one week of the accident. Three months later, clinical diagnoses and symptoms of PTSD were assessed in 147 children and 135 parents. We used the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV - Child and Parent version, the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses were performed to estimate the Areas Under the Curve as a measure of performance and to determine the optimal cut-off score in our sample. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. The aim was to maximize both sensitivity and negative predictive values.PTSD was diagnosed in 12% of the children; 10% of their parents scored above the cut-off point for PTSD. At the originally recommended cut-off scores (4 for children, 3 for parents), the sensitivity in our sample was 41% for children and 54% for parents. Negative predictive values were 92% for both groups. Adjusting the cut-off scores to 2 improved sensitivity to 82% for children and 92% for parents, with negative predictive values of 92% and 96%, respectively.With adjusted cut-off scores, the STEPP performed well: 82% of the children and 92% of the parents with a subsequent positive diagnosis were identified correctly. Special attention in the screening procedure is required because of a high rate of false positives. The STEPP appears to be a valid and useful instrument that can be used in the Netherlands as a first screening method in stepped psychotrauma care following accidents.",25

Therefore, it is important to identify protective factors that may ameliorate both exposure to and the impact of cumulative violence. This study aimed to identify sources of perceived social support amongst early adolescents in a low-income, high-violence community in South Africa, and to examine the association of perceived support with exposure to violence and with the severity of depression, aggression and conduct disorder symptoms.Method: A sample of 615 Grade 7 learners completed measures of perceived social support, different types of violence exposure and symptoms of depression, aggression and conduct disorder.Results: Maternal, paternal and overall family support were weakly associated with a reduced risk of domestic violence, but not with other forms of violence exposure, and were also weakly associated with a reduced risk of mental health difficulties. Peer support was associated with higher symptomatology across all mental health outcomes while teacher support was associated with greater severity of depression.Conclusions: The stress-buffering effects of social support may not be maintained in contexts of high exposure to violence. Implications for interventions to enhance youth safety and resilience in high-violence contexts are considered.",25

However, there is a lack of prospective longitudinal studies to further illuminate the temporal relationship between self-efficacy and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Thus, an important unresolved research question is whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms affect the level of self-efficacy or vice versa or whether they mutually influence each other. The present prospective longitudinal study investigated the reciprocal relationship between general self-efficacy (GSE) and posttraumatic stress symptoms in 143 physical assault victims. We used an autoregressive cross-lagged model across four assessment waves: within 4 months after the assault (T1) and then 3 months (T2), 12 months (T3) and 8 years (T4) after the first assessment. Stress symptoms at T1 and T2 predicted subsequent self-efficacy, while self-efficacy at T1 and T2 was not related to subsequent stress symptoms. These relationships were reversed after T3; higher levels of self-efficacy at T3 predicted lower levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms at T4, while posttraumatic tress symptoms at T3 did not predict self-efficacy at T4. In conclusion, posttraumatic stress symptoms may have a deteriorating effect on self-efficacy in the early phase after physical assault, whereas self-efficacy may promote recovery from posttraumatic stress symptoms over the long term.",25

Because mothers and infants may be especially vulnerable to trauma in conditions of war, it is urgent to determine which cognitive and emotional processes are effective for preventing negative trauma impacts.” This study examined whether mothers’ high posttraumatic growth (PTG) and positive posttraumatic cognitions (PTC) protected (a) their own mental health and (b) their infants’ stress regulation and sensorimotor and language development from the effects of war trauma. The participants were 511 Palestinian mothers and their infants living in the Gaza strip. The mothers were interviewed in their second trimester of pregnancy (T1) as well as when the infant was four months (T2) and twelve months (T3). Mothers reported posttraumatic growth (PTG; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996) at T1 and posttraumatic cognitions (PTCI; Foa et al., 1999) at T2. They also reported their exposure to traumatic war events both at T1 and T3 and described their mental health conditions (e.g., PTSD and/or depressive and dissociation symptoms) at T3. The Infant Behaviour Questionnaire (IBQ) was used to measure infants’ stress regulation at T2 and sensorimotor and language development at T3. The results, based on regression analyses with interaction terms between trauma and PTG, showed that high levels of traumatic war events were not associated with high levels of PTSD, depressive, or dissociation symptoms among mothers showing high levels of PTG. This suggests that PTG may protect maternal mental health from the effects of trauma. In turn, positive maternal PTCs appeared to protect the infants’ stress regulation from the effects of war trauma. The study concludes by discussing ways to develop and implement preventive interventions for mother-infant dyads in war conditions.",25

We compared this group with 43 individuals, matched for age and education, who had not experienced an earthquake but had moved to and lived in L’Aquila after the earthquake and thus experienced the challenges of living in an earthquake-struck city. This study aimed to show that earthquake-exposed individuals scored significantly higher than nonexposed persons on certain scales of the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) seven years after the event. Our results indicated that exposed individuals exhibited higher scores on the dissociation, intrusive experience, and defensive avoidance scales. Furthermore, a correlational analysis between specific conditions detected by the Earthquake Checklist L’Aquila (ECLA) and the TSI identified the influences of specific conditions, such as being trapped or injured under rubble during the earthquake, experiencing a persistent fear of aftershocks or a life-threatening feeling, and witnessing the death of a loved one. All of these experiences resulted in the persistence of trauma-related symptoms. Dissociative experiences during the trauma, cognitive and behavioral avoidance and reexperiencing were associated with negative effects and may hinder the natural process of recovery in trauma-exposed individuals. Knowledge of mid- and long-term psychological difficulties following a traumatic event may be useful for promoting interventions in mental health across exposed populations.",25

Predeployment assessment was conducted 4 months before deployment (T1). Of these, 1324 (70.8% retention rate) participated in assessment within 4 months after deployment (T2), and 1122 (60.0%) completed the third time point at 4 years after deployment (T3). PTSD symptoms were assessed with the posttraumatic stress checklist and physical symptoms with a 67-item self-report Health Symptom Checklist. To explore directional influences between symptoms over time, longitudinal cross-lagged association between the modeled latent factors for PTSD symptoms and physical symptoms was estimated using structural equation modeling.From T1 to T2, there was a significant bidirectional effect with higher physical symptom count at T1 predicting higher PTSD symptom severity at T2 ( β = 0.17, p < .001) and higher PTSD symptom severity at T1 predicting higher physical symptom count at T2 ( β = 0.13, p < .001). The effect of T2 on T3 was unidirectional. PTSD symptom severity at T2 had no effect on physical symptom count at T3, but physical symptom count at T2 predicted an increase in PTSD symptom severity at T3 ( β = 0.11, p = .013).Considering early physical symptoms and their physiological underpinnings after traumatic exposures could help identify those at risk of later PTSD.",26

Methods Moderately-to-severely injured patients admitted to 3 level-1 trauma centers were contacted between 6 and 12-months post-injury to assess for functional limitations, use of pain medications, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Multivariable adjusted regression analyses were used to compare long-term outcomes by sex. Potential mediators of the relationship between sex and outcomes was explored using mediation analysis. Results 2607 patients were followed, of which 45% were female. Compared to male, female patients were more likely to have functional limitations (OR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.31–1.60), take pain medications (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02–1.38), and screen positive for PTSD (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.46–1.76) post-injury. Age, extremity injury, previous psychiatric illness, and pre-injury unemployment, partially mediated the effect of female sex on long-term outcomes.

The data were collected in October, 2013, 1 year after the Gaza War on Nov 14–26, 2012. War-traumatic events were measured using the War-Traumatic Events Checklist (W-TECh), which includes three categories: personal trauma; witnessing trauma to others; and seeing demolition of property. Stressful life events were measured using the Stressful Life Events Scale. Exposure to traumatic events (not related to war-trauma) was measured using the University of California at Los Angeles post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) reaction index for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV (child version). PTSD was measured using the PTSD Symptoms Scale. Finally, depression was measured using the Child Depression Inventory.FindingsThe sample consisted of 1029 students aged 11–17 years. 496 (48%) participants were boys, and 533 (52%) participants were girls. 909 (88%) students had experienced personal trauma, 861 (84%) had witnessed trauma to others, and 908 (88%) had seen demolition of property during the war. Boys reported more exposure to personal trauma, witnessing trauma to others, seeing demolition of property, and overall traumatic events compared to girls. Girls reported more exposure to stressful life events, exposure to trauma (not related to war-trauma), PTSD, and depression. 549 (54%) students had a diagnosis of PTSD diagnosis. We found a positive correlation between the age and exposure to war-traumatic events and stressful life events and between family size and exposure to war-traumatic events and PTSD. By contrast, we found a negative correlation between family income and stressful life events, exposure to traumatic events not related to war trauma, PTSD, and depression. Finally, exposure to war-traumatic events, experience of stressful life events, and exposure to traumatic events not related to war-trauma were positively correlated with PTSD and depression.InterpretationSocioeconomic status such as big family size and low family income increased the severity of effects of stressful life events, exposure to war-traumatic events, and exposure to traumatic events not related to war-trauma. Consequently, the possibility of PTSD and depression was high. The findings also show that stressful life events, exposure to war-trauma, and exposure to traumatic events not related to war-trauma could be considered as risk factors for PTSD and depression.FundingQatar National Research Fund (QNRF), a member of Qatar Foundation Doha, Qatar, National Priority Research Programs under grant NPRP 7-154-3-034 to MS.",26

Of these, >80% reported interference with daily activities, with the most common symptoms being excessive worry and irritability. A common pattern was comorbid anxiety and depression, with smaller proportions reporting either disorder alone. Anxiety had large effect sizes with respect to life satisfaction and cognitive disability and medium to small effect sizes relative to societal participation and self-care. Middle age, black race, lower socioeconomic status, preinjury mental health treatment, and at least 1 traumatic brain injury prior to the index injury were all risk factors for later anxiety.Anxiety should be screened, fully evaluated, and treated after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury. Worry and irritability might be treated with pharmacologic agents or relatively simple behavioral interventions, which should be further researched in this population.",26

This extends beyond the previous studies that mainly focused on single indicators related to the mental health of disaster victims or examined community resilience factors in a limited way. The Korean Long-term Survey on the Change of Life of Disaster Victim data were used for random-effect analysis to investigate socio-political factors affecting the wellness of disaster survivors based on the disaster vulnerability plus theory. Results show that even in the South Korean context where disaster response is carried out from an administrative-centered perspective, various community resilience factors have significant associations with the wellness of disaster survivors. High levels of social support and satisfaction with support policies were protective factors. Victims who experienced disasters in non-capital areas showed better wellness than those in the capital area. Conflict experiences exacerbated survivors' wellness. Finally, sense of community after disasters had a mixed effect in various domains of wellness and the level of satisfaction with government agencies' disaster response had no significant effect. In conclusion, community resilience has a great influence on disaster survivors' wellness because disasters create crises in terms of community capacity and individual wellness due to limited resources, conflicts regarding distribution of resources and compensation, severance of existing relationships, and the creation of new relationships. Improving community resilience may be crucial in ameliorating and resolving inequalities in the negative impact of disasters.",26
https://openalex.org/W3092188313,10.1002/smi.2995,Association between trajectories of personal growth initiative and post‐traumatic stress after Hurricane Harvey: A latent growth mixture modeling approach,"Abstract Studies examining the association between personal growth initiative (PGI) and post‐traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have often utilized cross‐sectional research designs, and as a result, the changes in the levels of PGI and its association with the trajectory of PTSS remain unclear. The current study aimed to (1) explore the different trajectories in both PGI and PTSS and (2) examine the associations of the identified trajectories between PGI and PTSS among individuals. The final sample were 419 adults who were physically residing in the area when Hurricane Harvey made landfall on 26 August 2017. The initial data collection occurred approximately 16 months after the Hurricane, and participants were asked to participate again after 1‐ and 3‐month later. A result from the latent growth mixture modeling revealed that for PGI, the 4‐class model was the best‐fitting model, and for PTSS, the 3‐class model was the best‐fitting model. When examining the association between the trajectories of PGI and PSS, individuals classified to higher PGI subgroups were more likely to be associated with the Recovery PTSS subgroup. The current study suggests that disaster survivors with higher PGI were more likely to recover from PTSS, raising an importance of incorporating PGI to alleviate future PTSS.",26

Structural equation modeling and the actor-partner interdependence model were used to test the bidirectional dyadic association of both the survivors' and the spouses' dissociation with PTSD symptoms. The results demonstrated a positive association both between the survivors' trait dissociation and PTSD symptoms and between the spouses' trait dissociation and their PTSD symptoms. However, no significant associations were found at the bidirectional level. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the role of trait dissociation in PTSD. Although trait dissociation is associated with higher PTSD symptoms for both survivors and their spouses, its role may be limited in the bidirectional partner context. Theoretical and clinical implications of the findings are discussed.",26

Methods: In order to distinguish PGD from PTSD, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among tsunami survivors in five tsunami-affected coastal villages in India, 9 months after the Asian tsunami. Results: Prevalence of PGD among 643 tsunami survivors was 14.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.5%–16.9%) and among the 351 bereaved survivors was 25.9% (95% CI: 21.3%–30.5%). Spousal bereavement, extensive damage to homes, fewer years of education, and absence of tsunami-related physical injury differentiated those with PGD, after adjusting for potential confounders ( p &lt; .05). These factors were distinct from the factors associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among these survivors. Scores on the avoidance, hyper-arousal and intrusion subscales of the Impact of Events Scale–Revised were significantly lower in those with PGD alone than in those with PTSS or with both disorders. Conclusion: Our findings support the validity of PGD in a non-Western post-disaster community and its distinctness from PTSD. They have important public health implications in planning responses to natural disasters and for future revisions of diagnostic classifications.",26

The current prospective longitudinal case-controlled study aimed to examine the relative influence of injury and noninjury factors on symptoms in preschool and primary school-aged children who sustained an mTBI or mild extracranial injury at least 8 month earlier. Methods: Participants were 64 parents of children (31 mTBI, 33 trauma controls) who sustained injury between ages 2 and 12, whose postconcussive symptoms across the first 3-month postinjury have been previously described. The current study assessed postconcussive symptoms at 8 or more months postinjury (M = 24.3, SD = 8.4) and examined a range of injury and noninjury predictive factors. Results: At or beyond 8-month postinjury, symptom numbers in the mTBI group were comparable with those of the group who sustained mild extracranial injury. Educational attainment of parents (below or above high-school attainment level) was the only predictor of symptoms at follow-up, with preexisting learning difficulties approaching significance as a predictor. Conclusions: While our earlier study found that mTBI was associated with symptoms at 3-month postinjury, follow-up at more than 8 months showed mTBI no longer predicted symptom reporting. While mTBI contributes significantly to the presence of symptoms in the first few months postinjury, researchers and healthcare practitioners in this field need to consider the potential impact of noninjury factors on persistent or recurrent symptoms after mTBI.",26

We examined the heterogeneous associations between disaster‐related traumatic experiences and postdisaster mental health, using a novel machine learning–based causal inference approach. Methods Data were from a prospective cohort study of Japanese older adults in an area severely affected by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. The baseline survey was conducted 7 months before the disaster and the 2 follow‐up surveys were conducted 2.5 and 5.5 years after (n = 1150 to n = 1644 depending on the exposure‐outcome combinations). As disaster‐related traumatic experiences, we assessed complete home loss and loss of loved ones. Using the generalized random forest algorithm, we estimated conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) of the disaster damages on postdisaster mental health outcomes to examine the heterogeneous associations by 51 predisaster characteristics of the individuals. Results We found that, even when there was no population average association between disaster‐related trauma and subsequent mental health outcomes, some subgroups experienced severe impacts. We also identified and compared characteristics of the most and least vulnerable groups (ie, top versus bottom deciles of the estimated CATEs). While there were some unique patterns specific to each exposure‐outcome combination, the most vulnerable group tended to be from lower socioeconomic backgrounds with preexisting depressive symptoms for many exposure‐outcome combinations. Conclusions We found considerable heterogeneity in the association between disaster‐related traumatic experiences and subsequent mental health problems.",27

To date, no large study has examined post‐concussive symptoms in children sustaining concussions in motor vehicle collisions. This study aimed to compare trends in acute post‐concussive symptom burden in children with concussion following motor vehicle collisions as compared to other injury mechanisms. Methods The study is a secondary analysis of the Predicting Persistent Post‐concussive Problems in Pediatrics study, which prospectively recruited a multicenter cohort of 3029 children 5–17 years of age presenting to the ED with concussion from 2013–2015. Post‐concussive symptom ratings were obtained at pre‐specified time points for 12 weeks post‐injury, using the validated Post‐Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI). Symptom severity and recovery trajectories were measured using delta scores on the PCSI (mean post‐injury symptom score minus perceived pre‐injury score). A multivariable, longitudinal model evaluated the adjusted effect of mechanism of injury (motor vehicle collisions vs other mechanisms) on mean symptom scores, compared to perceived pre‐injury reports, and the temporal change in mean scores over during recovery. Results Of 3029 study participants, 56 (1.8%) sustained concussion from motor vehicle collisions. Children sustaining concussion in a motor vehicle collision had lower post‐concussive symptom scores upon ED presentation, measured as differences from their perceived pre‐injury reports, as compared to other injury mechanisms (−0.36 [95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.58, −0.15]). However, the motor vehicle collisions group showed the smallest decline in symptom burden over 1 month following injury (−0.54 [95% CI = −0.81, −0.27]). Conclusions Children sustaining concussions in motor vehicle collisions may have lower initial symptom burdens but slower symptom recovery at 1 month compared to other mechanisms of injury and may represent a distinct population for prognostic counseling in the ED requiring further research.",27

https://openalex.org/W4220966393,10.1093/jbcr/irac012.124,122 PTSD Symptom Clusters as Predictors of Pain Interference in Burn Survivors,"Abstract Introduction Individuals who experience burns are at higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. There exists a synergistic relationship between PTSD and chronic pain in burn survivors. Theories exist about how aspects of each condition may perpetuate one another, or share underlying mechanisms. Both of these conditions are of relevance to pain-related disability. We sought to examine the role of individual PTSD symptom clusters as predictors of pain interference. We hypothesized that the hyperarousal and emotional numbing symptom clusters would be predictive of pain interference, even when accounting for the other two PTSD symptom clusters, pain intensity, and other covariates (burn size, hospital length of stay, age and gender). Methods Data were analyzed from the Burn Model System National Database. Inclusion criteria required participants to have a moderate to severe burn injury that required surgery for wound closure. Patient-reported outcome data: PTSD Checklist - Civilian, PROMIS-Pain Interference Short Form 4a, and a 0-10 average Pain Intensity item were analyzed at 6-months after injury. Hierarchical linear regression models were fit to examine the impact of PTSD symptom clusters on pain interference over and above that of pain intensity, and standardized betas were calculated (B). Results A total of 439 adult participants had complete responses on the measures of interest (e.g. PTSD symptoms, PROMIS-Pain Interference, and Pain Intensity) and were included in the analysis. Mean age, percent total body surface area burned, and hospital length of stay were 47 years, 18%, and 27 days, respectively. 69% were male and 82% were Caucasian. Results of a linear regression found that hyperarousal (B = .10, p = .03) and emotional numbing (B = .13, p = .01) PTSD symptom clusters were each significant predictors of pain-related disability, even when accounting for pain intensity (B = .64, p &amp;lt; .001). The covariates age, gender, days until discharge, and TBSA were all nonsignificant. The model accounted for 61% of the variance associated with pain-related disability. Conclusions Results highlight the importance of the emotional numbing and hyperarousal PTSD symptom clusters in explaining pain interference. Future evaluations parsing out the longitudinal relationships (i.e., beyond 6-months postburn) between PTSD symptom clusters, pain intensity, and pain interference, as well as evaluating other underlying mechanisms, are warranted.",27

It was conducted in 8 residential facilities for street children in Mexico City, with assessments at baseline, posttreatment, and 3 months later. Children who reported at least moderate posttraumatic stress, and fulfilled the study requirement were enrolled in the study ( N = 100, 12–18 years old, 36 boys). There were 51 children randomized to CBT and 49 to the waitlist condition. Randomization was stratified by gender. CBT consisted of 12 individual 1‐hour sessions administered weekly by 2 trained, master's‐level clinicians. Outcome measures included self‐reports of PTS, depression, anxiety, and anger; global improvement was assessed by the independent evaluator. Compared to participants in the waitlist condition participants in CBT showed a significant reduction in all symptoms, with effects sizes of 1.73 to 1.75. At follow up there was attrition ( n = 36), and no change from posttreatment scores. The study did find statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the CBT group compared to the waitlist condition; symptoms remained stable at 3 months. The study found that CBT for trauma in a sample of street children provided a reduction of a broad range of mental health symptoms.",27

Psychological resilience refers to people's assessment of their ability to withstand negative psychological consequences of major afflictions, and to keep functioning despite these adversities. The following hypotheses were examined: 1. The Jewish sample would score higher than the Arab sample on indices of individual, community and national resilience. 2. Men of both groups would score higher compared with women on these resilience indices. 3. Exposure to terror and fear of upcoming war would negatively predict the resilience of both groups. 4. Higher level of religiosity, right wing political attitudes, higher income, higher education, older age and higher sense of coherence will positively predict the investigated resiliencies. The random sample included 1100 Jews and 350 Arabs who participated in an internet survey. Resilience was defined in this study as the balance of individual, community and national strength (protective factors) to vulnerability (risk factors). The results supported the first three hypotheses whereas the fourth hypothesis was supported only for the Jewish sample. The present study indicated that some predictors had universal effect on resilience, whereas others seemed to be culture specific predictors.",27

The clinical course of PTSD varies between individuals, and patterns of symptom development have yet to be clearly delineated. Previous studies have been limited by convenience sampling, short follow-up periods, and the inability to account for combat-related trauma. To determine the trajectories of PTSD symptoms among deployed military personnel with and without combat exposure, we used data from a population-based representative sample of 8,178 US service members who participated in the Millennium Cohort Study from 2001 to 2011. Using latent growth mixture modeling, trajectories of PTSD symptoms were determined in the total sample, as well as in individuals with and without combat exposure, respectively. Overall, 4 trajectories of PTSD were characterized: resilient, pre-existing, new-onset, and moderate stable. Across all trajectories, combat-deployed service members diverged from non–combat-deployed service members, even after a single deployment. The former also generally had higher PTSD symptoms. Based on the models, nearly 90% of those without combat exposure remained resilient over the 10-year period, compared with 80% of those with combat exposure. Findings demonstrate that although the clinical course of PTSD symptoms shows heterogeneous patterns of development, combat exposure is uniformly associated with poor mental health.",27

Individual-level factors such as age may also contribute to a disaster's impact on mental health, though it is unclear whether young age confers a protective effect or represents a period of increased risk as compared to adulthood.The present study evaluated the influence of adolescent age and hurricane experiences on mental health in the years following multiple hurricanes in the New Orleans region.794 women, currently aged 18-45, participating in a cohort study of lifetime adversity and reproductive health completed a survey about hurricane experience and current mental health. Joint associations between disaster experience and age at the time of disaster on depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated.Compared to women who were adults at the time of the disaster, being in early adolescence resulted in reduced depression and PTSD up to 9-years post-disaster, controlling for hurricane experiences, time since disaster, and income. A similar effect was not observed among older adolescents. Increased endorsement of feeling one's life was in danger and experiencing illness or injury resulted in increased odds of depression, while danger was associated with increased odds of PTSD.Younger age at the time of a natural disaster may confer a protective effect on mental health outcomes post-disaster, even when disaster experiences are considered, potentially representing the importance of parental support and cognitive development on disaster effects.",27

Design, setting and participants Danish FDS responders (n=3935) and non-responders (n=3046) to a 6-month post-deployment screening questionnaire after returning from a first-ever deployment to Kosovo, Iraq or Afghanistan (2002 to 2012) were included in the study and followed in public registers from 6 months to 5 years post-deployment. Primary and secondary outcome measures We tested Cox regression models including deployment experiences (1a), screening levels of PTSD and depressive symptoms (1b), and their combination (2) for FDS responders. For all FDS, a secondary model included a measure on whether they responded to the questionnaire (3). Results Neither the deployment experiences (1a) of exposure to danger and combat (HR=1.00, 95% CI=0.97 to 1.03) and witnessing consequences of war (HR=1.01, 95% CI=0.96 to 1.06), or the screening levels (1b) of PTSD (HR=1.06, 95% CI=0.84 to 1.33) and depressive symptoms (HR=0.82, 95% CI=0.64 to 1.06) were significant predictors of transitioning from unemployment to employment. Similar results were found for the combined model (2). A tendency among non-respondents (3) to have a lower probability of transitioning from unemployment to employment was found (HR=0.90, 95% CI=0.81 to 1.00). Conclusion Deployment experiences, PTSD and depressive symptoms, as measured at 6-month screening questionnaire, did not predict differences in the probability of gaining employment when unemployed within 5 years post-deployment. However, the findings suggest that those with the least probability of transitioning from unemployment to employment can be found among the non-responders to the post-deployment screening questionnaire.",27

First, pain trajectory from early childhood to early adolescence were modeled. Second, we examined how early childhood individual-, parental-, and family-level factors predict pain trajectories. Third, we evaluated consequences of pain trajectories in terms of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and substance use at age 16 years.The current paper is a secondary data analysis of a multisite longitudinal study. A total of 731 children and their families were followed from ages 2 to 16 years.A growth mixture model (GMM) was used to identify pain trajectories from ages 2 to 14 years.The GMM revealed three distinct pain trajectories: (1) Low Pain Symptom (n = 572); (2) Increasing Pain Symptom (n = 106); and (3) U-shaped Pain Symptom (n = 53). Children who experienced greater harsh parenting and sleep disturbances in early childhood were more likely to belong to the Increasing Pain Symptom group, and those with greater anxious-depressed symptoms at age 2 years were more likely to belong to the U-shaped Pain Symptom group than the Low Pain Symptom group. Additionally, those youth in the Increasing Pain Symptom group, compared to the Low and U-shaped Pain Symptom groups, showed elevated anxiety symptoms at age 16 years.Reducing harsh parenting and children's sleep disturbances could be important targets for preventing pediatric pain problems. Children with increasing pain symptoms may also benefit from learning adaptive pain management skills to lower the risk of developing anxiety problems in late adolescence.",27

Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom have amplified the need for a better understanding of the association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorders (AUD). We prospectively examined PTSD and AUD symptoms and investigated relations between combat exposure (CE) and relationship status (RS) on these outcomes. We hypothesized that CE would have a main effect on both PTSD and AUD symptoms while RS would have a main effect on AUD symptoms but not PTSD. We also examined CE X RS interactions as well as hypothesized reciprocal prospective PTSD and AUD associations. Participants (N=238, 92% men) were National Guard and Reserve Soldiers returning from deployment, recruited as part of a larger study. Twelve month data were available for 66.8% of the initial sample with no evidence of differential attrition according to baseline AUD, PTSD or CE. We examined both PTSD and AUD symptoms for months one, six and 12 post-deployment, derived from initial and follow-up clinical interviews. Assessments consisted of the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE). We conducted separate (RS X CE X Time) mixed-design ANOVAs on our primary measures of interest (PTSD & AUD). RS was coded as single/divorced vs. married/cohabitating and CE was categorized according to “minimal”, “moderate” and “severe” levels. CE was significantly associated with PTSD but no other main or interaction effects emerged. To examine hypothesized reciprocal associations between PTSD and AUD we conducted cross-lagged panel path models with RS, CE and the RS X CE interaction as manifest exogenous variables. In separate models we examined alcohol abuse or dependence vs. dependence alone. CE consistently predicted Time 1 PTSD symptoms and RS predicted Time 1 alcohol dependence, but in contrast to our hypotheses no other main or interaction effects were observed including anticipated reciprocal relations between PTSD and AUD. In large part, this is due to strong (i.e., > .8) autoregressive effects across the three time points. Findings support hypothesized effects of CE on PTSD symptoms but the lack of observed hypothesized associations elsewhere suggests the need for longer measurement intervals in prospective research, as well as larger and more diverse samples.

To investigate how health professionals who experienced a traumatic event are expressing PTSS and factors related to risk for higher PTSS symptomatology can inform how health professionals are facing their role in this crisis. This was an Internet cross-sectional survey. Participants were 49,767 Brazilian health professionals who have ever faced a traumatic event, which was about 25.9% of an initial sample of health professionals. PTSS symptoms were assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and latent profile analysis (LPA) explored subpopulations within participants based on their scores. Distinct profiles were compared for psychological distress (e.g., depression and anxiety) and quality of life. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between IES-R profiles and COVID-19 related experiences, thoughts, and perceptions. A two-profile model was the most appropriate for the IES-R data pointing out a group with a high level of PTSS (named high-PTSS; n = 10,401, 20.9%) and another expressing a low level of symptoms (named low-PTSS; n = 39,366, 79.1%). The high-PTSS profile demonstrated worse psychological scores (global psychological distress, somatization, depression, and anxiety) and worse quality of life (physical, psychological, social, and environmental) with moderate magnitudes. Small but significant predictors of the high-PTSS profile included sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 related experiences, thoughts, and perceptions. Most individuals who experienced a traumatic event were not in the high-PTSS profile. For those who were, however, psychological and quality of life measures were much worse.

Levels of CSE and PTSD symptoms were measured with 4-month intervals. In addition, prospectively assessed personality traits and general self-efficacy perceptions as well as peritraumatic distress were entered in the analyses. The study sample consists of adult respondents of a representative internet panel who experienced PTE in the six months before T1, and did not experience any new PTE or life event between T1 and T3 (N = 400). Respondents were administered the coping self-efficacy scale (CSE-7), impact of event scale (IES) and arousal items of IES-R at each wave (T1 through T3), as well as questions on peritraumatic stress and prospectively measured personality traits (T0). Results of structural equation modeling showed that the effect of CSE on subsequent PTSD symptom levels was dominant. CSE significantly predicted subsequent symptoms, over and above earlier symptom levels, with higher CSE associated with lower PTSD. Symptoms in turn, did not predict subsequent levels of CSE. Higher peritraumatic distress was associated with both higher initial PTSD symptoms and lower initial CSE levels. Higher levels of the personality traits of emotional stability and agreeableness were associated with higher initial CSE levels. This supports a model in which CSE perceptions play an important role in recovery from trauma.",28

However, less is known about the impact of this collective trauma over time. Beginning at the end of December 2006, a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents (Cohort 2, N = 1,613) examined the long‐term effects of 9/11, with annual assessments administered every year for 3 years. We assessed rates of 9/11‐related posttraumatic stress (PTS) annually during the first 2 years of the study; during the second and third years of the study, we assessed fear and worry regarding future terrorism. Rates of PTS among participants were compared with those assessed annually in a nationally representative sample between 2002 and 2004 (Cohort 1); results indicated a relatively stable pattern of 9/11‐related PTS symptoms for 6 years following the attacks. Five to six years after 9/11, we found an association between 9/11‐related PTS and both direct, B = 8.45, 95% CI [4.32, 12.59] and media‐based (live television), B = 1.78, 95% CI [0.90, 2.65] exposure to the attacks. Six to 7 years post‐9/11, fear and worry regarding future terrorism were predicted by 9/11‐related PTS symptoms that had been reported approximately 5 years after the attacks, B = 0.04, 95% CI [0.03, 0.05]. The psychological legacy of 9/11 was perceptible among many U.S. residents throughout the decade that followed.",28

A longitudinal study of parental mental health following the 2011 terrorist attack on Utøya Island,"Little is known about parents' health following their children's exposure to trauma. We investigated the mental health of parents of young terrorist survivors and assessed parental distress and guilt as potential predictors of mental health.Mothers and fathers (N=531) participated in two study waves 4-5 and 14-15 months after the shooting. Posttraumatic stress reactions (PTSS) and anxiety/depression were compared with age- and gender-adjusted expected scores that were calculated from a concurrent population study. Mixed effects models investigated the associations between parental distress, parental guilt, and mental health.Parents' level of anxiety/depression was three times higher and PTSS was five times higher than that of the general population. Parental distress and guilt about their child's traumatic experience contributed uniquely to symptoms at both time points.Parents of traumatized youth constitute a vulnerable group that has been overlooked in the literature. Intervention strategies following trauma should include both survivors and their parents.",28

Participants completed a self-administered online survey including items on sociodemographic information, working conditions, fears, and worries about the COVID-19 pandemic, past natural disaster experiences, depressive symptoms, and resilience. Logistic regressions models were performed to explain the relationship between depressive symptomatology and COVID-19 experiences and worries. 40.9% (n = 107) of the sample were classified as having some level (mild to severe) of depressive symptomatology (PHQ-8 ≥5). Results reflect normal to high levels of psychological resilience (BRS; M = 3.7, SD = 0.7). A significant association was found between depressive symptomatology and psychological resilience (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.25-0.77). The odds of having depressive symptomatology were almost five times higher (OR = 4.79, 95% CI: 1.71-13.44) among those who reported emotional coping difficulties during the pandemic after experiencing a natural disaster compared to those that did not, when adjusting for psychological resilience and residence region. Despite normal to high psychological resilience levels, HCWs who reported emotional coping difficulties due to previous disasters were at risk of developing depressive symptomatology. Results suggest interventions to address the mental health of HCWs could benefit from considering other individual and environmental factors beyond resilience. Findings could inform future interventions to promote HCWs' well-being before, during, and after a natural disaster or pandemic outbreak.",28

However, little is known regarding how mental health symptoms fluctuate in the period leading up to and following separation from the military. Methods The current study examined posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms reported on surveys completed within 1 year of military separation from 23,887 active duty Millennium Cohort Study participants. A series of general linear models and graphs stratified by demographic and military characteristics examined the association between time until/since separation and mental health symptoms. Results Character of discharge had the most striking relationship between time until/since separation and mental health. Personnel with Honorable discharges did not differ in their level of mental health symptoms across the study period. In contrast, personnel with Other than Honorable/General discharges reported normal levels of mental health symptoms 1 year-prior to separation but reported progressively greater symptoms leading to separation which persisted through the remainder of study period. Conclusions This study suggests that additional outreach is needed for personnel with Other than Honorable/General discharges. However, for most other personnel, increased mental health symptomatology around military separation is not a normative phenomenon and any instance should be treated promptly.",29

THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN WAR-RELATED STRESS, PTSD SYMPTOMS, AND SUB-CLINICAL PSYCHOSIS: A CROSS-CULTURAL POPULATION-BASED STUDY AMONG PALESTINIAN AND ISRAELI YOUNG ADULTS","Sub-clinical or attenuated psychosis symptoms (APS) in the general population has become a focus of considerable research interest over the past two decades, as they appear to index an increased risk for psychotic outcomes. Recent data from several community-based studies around the world provide convincing support for an association of APS with traumatic stress that is likely moderated by familial genetic risk and gender. However, relatively little is known about the degree to which APS are associated with terror/war-related stress. Moreover, relatively little is known about the degree to which cultural/religious factors moderate this association. Hence, the overarching goal of this study was to address this lacuna in the literature by examining the relationship between exposure to terror/war-related events, PTSD symptoms and familial genetic risk among Palestinian and Israeli youth. Exposure to terror/war-related trauma, presence and severity of PTSD symptoms, perceived ability to cope with trauma, familial genetic-risk, and APS were assessed in a representative sample of 530 Israeli and 1100 Palestinian (451 from Israel, 264 from the West Bank, and 385 from the Gaza Strip) young adults with a mean age of 36.7 (SD=8.4). PTSD symptoms were assessed with the Post-traumatic Disorder Scale (PDS), perceived ability to cope with trauma with the Perceived Ability To Cope With Trauma Scale (PACT), and APS with the Community Assessments of Psychic Experiences (CAPE). As hypothesized, there was a significant three-way interaction effect of exposure to terror-war-related trauma, religion, and familial genetic-risk on APS. The highest level of APS was among Palestinians who live in the Gaza strip, with no significant differences between Jews and Palestinians who live in Israel or in the West Bank. Also, consistent with our hypotheses, the three-way association between exposure to trauma, familial genetic risk and religion was mediated by PTSD symptoms and perceived ability to cope with trauma. These findings provide further support for the link between exposure to trauma, familial genetic-risk, and APS. Also, it provides further support for the mediating role that PTSD symptoms play in this link. Finally, it suggests that religious background moderates the link between exposure to trauma and APS.",29

Due to organizational reasons a control group could not be included. Statistical analyses included repeated-measures ANOVA with cPTSD as between-subject factor.The reduction of depressive symptoms at discharge was persistent at 6 and 12 months follow-up. Somatization symptoms were increased at discharge, but were leveled out at 6 months follow-up. The same effect was found for cPTSD symptoms in those patients with non-complex trauma-related disorders: Their increase of cPTSD symptoms was flattened at 6 months follow-up. Patients with a very high risk for cPTSD showed a strong linear reduction of cPTSD symptoms from admission to discharge and 6 months follow-up. cPTSD patients had a higher symptom load compared to patients without cPTSD on all time points and scales.Multimodal, day clinic trauma-focused treatment is associated with positive changes even after 6 and 12 months. Positive therapy outcomes (reduced depression, reduced cPTSD symptoms for patients with a very high risk for cPTSD) could be maintained. However, PTSD symptomatology was not significantly reduced. Increases in somatoform symptoms were leveled out and can therefore be regarded as side effects of treatment, which may be connected with actualization of trauma in the intensive psychotherapeutic treatment. Further analyses should be applied in larger samples and a control group.",29

Research indicates treatment response is a non-linear process characterized by combinations of gradual changes and abrupt shifts in depression symptoms, although less is known about differential trajectories of depression symptoms in therapist-supported digital mental health interventions (DMHI).Repeated measures latent profile analysis was used to empirically identify differential trajectories based upon biweekly depression scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) among patients engaging in a therapist-supported DMHI from January 2020 to July 2021. Multivariate associations between symptom trajectories with sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were examined with multinomial logistic regression. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were defined as a five-point change on the PHQ-9 from baseline to week 12.The final sample included 2192 patients aged 18 to 82 (mean = 39.1). Four distinct trajectories emerged that differed by symptom severity and trajectory of depression symptoms over 12 weeks. All trajectories demonstrated reductions in symptoms. Despite meeting MCID criteria, evidence of treatment resistance was found among the trajectory with the highest symptom severity. Chronicity of major depressive episodes and lifetime trauma exposures were ubiquitous across the trajectories in a multinomial logistic regression model.These data indicate that changes in depression symptoms during DMHI are heterogenous and non-linear, suggesting a need for precision care strategies to address treatment resistance and increase engagement. Future efforts should examine the effectiveness of trauma-informed treatment modules for DMHIs as well as protocols for continuation treatment and relapse prevention.",29

Trauma, one such outcome of disasters, may result in the development of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study aimed to identify the level of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and also its predictor factors among survivors of a landslide disaster at Donorati Village community, Purworejo, Indonesia Method: This was a descriptive cross-sectional design research using a quantitative approach. The population of this study were the landslide survivors in Purworejo district. While this research sample was 100 survivors who live in Donorati village. Cluster and consecutive sampling techniques was applied for this study. The variables of this study were PTSD, gender, age, education level, socio-economic status based on occupation, marriage status, severity of natural disaster, exposure to previous disaster events, landslide disaster impact (house damage, injured family members, and death of family members) and evacuation record. The instruments of this research were demographic form and The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Bivariate analysis was performed using Chi-squared test and Fisher’s test, followed by multivariate analysis using logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of probability of PTSD participants was 27%. Bivariate analysis revealed significant differences in PTSD levels based on sex (p-value = 0,02), age (p-value = 0,009), occupation (p-value = 0,02), severity of disaster (p-value = 0,008), the presence of injured family members (p-value = 0,018), and evacuation history (p-value = 0,001). The multivariate analysis revealed the factors related to PTSD after the landslide as gender and severity of the disaster impact. Conclusions: The level of PTSD was significantly different based on gender, age, occupation, severity of the disaster, the presence of injured family members, and a history of evacuation. Mental health and psychosocial support services need to be developed to help reduce the impact of disasters and to assist survivors to cope better with the outcomes of those events.",29

However, such fluctuations are typically short ranged and have rarely been investigated over the course of decades after the trauma. Moreover, existing studies have used a variety of measurements, either employing a categorical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-oriented approach or a continuous measure of symptom severity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the two methods of analyzing trajectories of PTSD by examining the level of concordance between them, their sensitivity, and their validity. Method: A total of 349 Israeli veterans from the 1973 Yom Kippur War were examined at four time points over more than four decades since the war. A latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was conducted to identify different PTSD trajectories, using both categorical and continuous PTSD assessments. Results: Descriptive results revealed that the four commonly observed patterns of PTSD are insufficient for capturing the range of individual PTSD trajectories. Using a categorical measure in the explorative LCGA yielded three trajectories (resilient, chronic, and delayed onset). The continuous measure yielded five trajectories (resilient, chronic, recovered, and two delayed-onset trajectories), which provided a slightly more nuanced distinction of participants’ distress-induced psychosocial dysfunction as compared to the three-trajectory solution. Conclusion: These findings suggest that using a continuous PTSD trajectory measure provides a somewhat more sensitive estimation of PTSD trajectories. More specifically, taking into consideration symptom intensity and fluctuation over time may provide a more comprehensive picture of the survivors’ distress.",29

Traumatically injured patients (N = 1,035) were assessed during hospital admission and at 3 (85%) and 12 months (73%). Quality of life prior to traumatic injury was measured with the World Health Organization Quality of Life–BREF during hospitalization and at each subsequent assessment. PTSD was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale at 3 and 12 months. After controlling for preinjury functioning, current pain, and comorbid depression, patients whose PTSD symptoms had resolved by 12 months were more likely to have poorer quality of life in psychological (OR = 3.51), physical (OR = 10.17), social (OR = 4.54), and environmental (OR = 8.83) domains than those who never developed PTSD. These data provide initial evidence that PTSD can result in lingering effects on functional capacity even after remission of symptoms.

One domain of functioning that faced significant threat because of this disruption was student engagement. The purpose of this study was to examine predictors of student engagement, as measured by the BASC-2-SRP School Problems scale, in youth affected by the Hurricane Katrina over four time points (3-7 months, 13-17 months, 19-22 months and 25-27 months post-Katrina). Participants included 426 youths living in New Orleans and the surrounding parishes at the time Hurricane Katrina made land-fall. Examined predictors included hurricane exposure, PTSD symptoms, peer and parent social support, violence exposure, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. Analyses included repeated measures ANOVA and hierarchical regression. Results indicated stability in student engagement, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and violence exposure across time. PTSD symptom severity decreased over time. Social support increased over time. Predictors at Time 1 showed decreasing influence and were no longer significant by Time 4. Analyses showed an evolving picture of predictors of student engagement over time.",30

A systematic review of research literature following PRISMA guidelines between 1980 and 2023 was conducted using databases like PsychINFO, PubMed, ProQuest, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Approximately 78 articles were initially identified and evaluated in the preliminary search using the identified keywords. Of those retrieved, 22 met the criteria and were included integrating the findings from 18 quantitative and 04 qualitative studies. The review findings suggest that the mean prevalence of growth in sexual assault survivors ranges from 4.59 to 64.04 in the PTGI total scores, ranging from 0 to 105. Overall, small to moderate PTG was found to be a recurring phenomenon among survivors of sexual assault. The highest level of growth was consistently experienced in relating to other domain. Posttraumatic stress, social support, religiosity/spirituality, and control over recovery were suggested to be associated with posttraumatic growth.

Questions broadly focused on post-concussion stress, with specific probes for caregiving responsibilities, concussion knowledge, and athletic participation. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.Ten mothers and 2 fathers participated. Five themes stemmed from our analysis: 1) Concussion Knowledge (central theme): stressors related to sources of concussion information; 2) Child Health Factors: stressors related to injury and illness, including concussion; 3) Activity Factors: stressors related to academic and athletic performance; 4) Parent-Injured Child Relationship Factors: stressors related to providing care to the child; and 5) Personal Factors: stressors unrelated to the concussion (e.g. family, social, career, etc.). Child Health Factors was most frequently identified as the primary stressor (n = 9).Sources of parental stress were varied following pediatric concussion. Issues relating to the child's post-injury dysfunction and the uncertain recovery from concussion were key stressors identified by parents. Moving forward, this framework can be used to ground the development of specific parental stress screening tools and interventions, which may benefit the parent's mental health and the child's clinical recovery.",30

The PRESIT program consisted of three predeployment training modules: (1) educational materials on combat and operational stress control, (2) coping skills training involving focused and relaxation breathing exercises with biofeedback, and (3) exposure to a video multimedia stressor environment to practice knowledge and skills learned in the first two modules. Heart rate variability assessed the degree to which a subset of participants learned the coping skills. With a cluster randomized design, data from 351 Marines randomized into PRESIT and control groups were collected at predeployment and from 259 of these who responded to surveys on return from deployment. Findings showed that the PRESIT group reduced their physiological arousal through increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia during and after breathing training relative to controls. Logistic regression, corrected for clustering at the platoon level, examined group effects on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as measured by the Post-traumatic Stress Checklist after controlling for relevant covariates. Results showed that PRESIT protected against PTSD among Marines without baseline mental health problems. Although limited by a small number of participants who screened positive for PTSD, this study supports the benefits of PRESIT as a potential preventive strategy in the U.S. military personnel.",30

Participants: Participants were 534 undergraduate students who experienced a potentially traumatic event (PTE). Data collection occurred from March 2013 to December 2014. Methods: Because this was a preliminary study, archival data was used. Participants consisted of students who experienced a PTE within the past three years. Results: Latent profile analysis indicated a five-class model as the best-fitting model. Direct exposure and intentionality of the event were significant predictors of class membership; length of time since event and gender did not predict class membership. Conclusions: The current study provides a potential explanation of the inconsistent results between PGI and PTSS and also highlights the importance of acknowledging subgroups when utilizing PGI after a PTE.",30

Meanwhile, data are scarce on survivors’ perspectives and potential mental health symptoms associated with timing of evacuation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate survivors’ contentment with evacuation time and whether duration at disaster site following the 2004 tsunami was associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and psychological morbidity. Methods: Of 10,116 Swedish tsunami survivors who returned to Sweden in the first 3 weeks post tsunami, 4910 (49%) answered a questionnaire 14 months later including questions on evacuation time, contentment with evacuation time and PTSS (Impact of Event Scale). We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of PTSS by timing of evacuation adjusting for gender, age, education, various indicators of trauma exposure and pre-tsunami psychiatric diagnoses. Results: More than half of the survivors (53%) were content with evacuation time while 33% wanted later evacuation and 13% earlier evacuation. Compared with those evacuated 14–21 days post tsunami, individuals evacuated at day 1–4 presented with increased odds of PTSS (crude OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.0–4.5; and multivariable adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3–3.0) and impaired mental health (crude OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2–2.4; and multivariable adjusted OR 1.4 95% CI 1.0–2.0). Conclusions: One-third of Swedish tsunami survivors preferred a later evacuation from disaster sites. These findings call for further studies, with prospective designs, to disentangle the causal direction of the association between evacuation time and PTSS.",30

Disaster-related depression research is complicated by the relatively high prevalence of the major depressive disorder in general populations even without trauma exposure. The extant research is inconclusive regarding associations between disaster media contact and depression outcomes, in part, because most studies have not distinguished diagnostic and symptomatic outcomes, differentiated postdisaster incidence from prevalence, or considered disaster trauma exposures. This study examined these associations in a volunteer sample of 254 employees of New York City businesses after the 11 September 2001, terrorist attacks. Structured interviews and questionnaires were administered 35 months after the attacks. Poisson and logistic regression analyses revealed that post-9/11 news contact significantly predicted the number of postdisaster persistent/recurrent and incident depressive symptoms in the full sample and in the indirect and unexposed groups. The findings suggest that clinical and public health approaches should be particularly alert to potential adverse postdisaster depression outcomes related to media consumption in disaster trauma-unexposed or indirectly-exposed groups.",30

We used the results of questionnaire surveys conducted in 2013 and 2017 amongst residents of Noda Village, Iwate Prefecture, to determine the factors that affected the sense of recovery of their personal lives as well as their sense of the recovery of the village itself. We also examined how differences in the choice of temporary housing affected their sense of recovery. Utilizing decision tree analysis, we clarified differences in the key factors that impacted their short-term and long-term perspectives as well as the sense of their own recovery and their sense of the village’s recovery. Because the introduction of publicly-funded rental housing deviated from the temporary housing networks available in previous disasters, there remains the possibility that although the short-term sense of recovery of those in publicly-funded temporary housing was relatively low, it seemed to increase over the long-term.",30

Extremity contractures have been documented in up to one third of severely burned patients at discharge. However, little is known about the long-term impact of these contractures. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of extremity contractures with employment after burn injury. We obtained data from the Burn Model System database from 1994 to 2003. We included in the study cohort all adult patients who were working prior to injury and identified those discharged with and without a contracture in one of the major extremity joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee and ankle). We classified contracture severity according to mild, moderate and severe categories. We performed descriptive analyses and predictive modeling to identify injury and patient factors associated with return to work (RTW) at 6, 12, and 24 months. A total of 1,203 participant records met criteria for study inclusion. Of these, 415 (35%) had developed a contracture at discharge; 9% mild, 12% moderate, and 14% severe. Among 801 (67%) participants who had complete data at 6 months after discharge, 70% of patients without contracture had returned to work compared to 45% of patients with contractures (p < 0.001). RTW increased at each subsequent follow-up time point for the contracture group, however, it remained significantly lower than in no-contracture group (both p < 0.01). In multivariable analyses, female sex, non-Caucasian ethnicity, larger burn size, alcohol abuse, number of in-hospital operations, amputation, and in-hospital complications were associated with a lower likelihood of employment. In adjusted analyses, discharge contracture was associated with a lower probability of RTW at all 3 time points, although its impact significantly diminished at 24 months. This study indicates an association between discharge contracture and reduced employment 6, 12 and 24 months after burn injury. Among many other identified patient, injury, and hospitalization related factors that are barriers to RTW, the presence of a contracture at discharge adds a significant reintegration burden for working-age burn patients.",30

Self-report measures at baseline assessed sociodemographic characteristics; trauma exposures; psychiatric and substance use disorders; mental, cognitive, and physical functioning; and psychosocial factors including expectations of aging. Latent growth mixture modeling identified the nature and correlates of 10-year PTSD symptom trajectories.Most of the sample had no/low PTSD symptoms (88.7%), while 6.0% had consistently subthreshold symptoms, 2.7% consistently high symptoms, and 2.6% increasing symptoms. Relative to the no/low symptom group, the subthreshold and high symptom groups reported more medical conditions and cognitive difficulties, with younger age and more lifetime traumatic events additionally linked to the high symptom trajectory. Relative to the no/low symptom group, Veterans with increasing symptoms were more likely to report functional disability and lifetime nicotine use disorder, cognitive difficulties, negative expectations regarding physical and emotional aging, and traumatic events over the study period.Despite high rates of trauma exposure, most older Veterans do not evidence symptomatic PTSD trajectories; however, about 11% do. Results underscore the importance of assessing PTSD symptoms in this population and considering longitudinal trajectories as well as associated risk and protective factors.",30

This study thus investigated the association between trauma exposure and children's mental health, and the contribution of parent-related factors in this association. A cross-sectional study with 263 Syrian refugee children-parent dyads was conducted in Turkey. The Stressful Life Events Questionnaire (SLE), General Health Questionnaire, Parenting Stress Inventory (PSI-SF), Impact of Events Scale for Children (CRIES-8), and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were used to measure trauma exposure, parental psychopathology, parenting-related stress, children's post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and mental health problems, respectively. Trauma exposure significantly accounted for unique variance in children's PTSS scores. Parental psychopathology significantly contributed in predicting children's general mental health, as well as emotional and conduct problems, after controlling for trauma variables. Interventions need to be tailored to refugee families' mental health needs. Trauma-focused interventions should be applied with children with PTSD; whilst family-based approaches targeting parents' mental health and parenting-related stress should be used in conjunction with individual interventions to improve children's comorbid emotional and behavioural problems.",30

We applied a more comprehensive model of trauma-specific coping and resilience, which included Ungar's context model and included decentral factors of resilience (i.e., environments that provide resources to build resilience).We assessed resilience in a cohort of former Swiss indentured child laborers (N = 74; 59% males) at two time points; first at the mean age of 80 years and then again 20 months later. At each time point, the following measures of resilience were assessed: resilience indicators of life satisfaction and lack of depression. In addition, resilience predictors of trauma exposure, perceived social support, dysfunctional disclosure of traumatic experiences, social acknowledgment as a victim, and self-efficacy; and decentral resilience factors of education, income, number of children, and physical health were measured.Using path-analysis, we found that life satisfaction and lack of depression were predicted by dysfunctional disclosure, social support, and self-efficacy at various significance levels. Change scores of resilience were predicted by higher trauma exposure, social acknowledgment as a victim, and an interaction between the two. The model for decentral factors also fitted, with physical health and income predicting the resilience indicators.Applying this comprehensive resilience model in a sample of older adults revealed meaningful findings in predicting resilience at a single time point and over time. Atypical coping strategies, such as perceived social acknowledgment as a victim and disclosure, may be particularly important for former victims who have suffered institutional abuse.",31

Dialectical Behavior Therapy Prolonged Exposure (DBT PE) is a recent protocol developed by Melanie Harned, integrating (PE) into standard (DBT). The protocol has showed promising results in treating comorbid PTSD in BPD patients. The current study, however, was the first trial to apply DBT PE protocol in Egypt. Objectives To investigate the efficacy of (DBT PE) protocol in reducing trauma-related symptoms (psychological trauma symptoms and trauma-related cognitions) among Egyptian women with BPD. Methods Sixteen women diagnosed with BPD and trauma-related symptoms, were recruited from “DBT clinic”, a private outpatient clinic in Alexandria, Egypt and randomly divided into equivalent (Therapeutic &amp; Control) groups. The therapeutic group received DBT PE protocol while the control group received Treatment as usual (TAU). Participants were assessed pre and post-intervention using: The short version of the Borderline Symptom list, The Trauma Symptom Checklist-40, and The Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory. The therapeutic group started treatment with standard comprehensive DBT concurrently with DBT PE protocol (14 individual sessions, 120 minutes/ week), according to readiness criteria suggested by the treatment developer. Results Patients who received DBT PE protocol showed significantly lower degrees of psychological trauma symptoms and trauma-related cognitions compared to patients in control group. Conclusions Despite being applied for the first time in Egypt, DBT PE protocol proved to be an effective intervention in reducing trauma-related symptoms in a sample of Egyptian BPD patients without any need to modify the original protocol.

The participants of the study were 437 Palestinian adults: 190 males and 247 females, they were recruited using online methods; emails, Facebook, and Twitter.Results indicated that quality of life negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (r = -0.603; p < 0.01), and hopelessness (r = -0.453; p < 0.01), and positively correlated with resilience (r = 0.534; p < 0.05), and sense of belonging (r = 0.428; p < 0.01). Results of SEM indicated the correlation between quality of life, depressive symptoms, and hopelessness was fully mediated by the sense of belonging and resilience.Our study sheds light on resilience and sense of belonging as protective factors against ongoing traumatic experiences among Palestinians. Future research should be addressed to understand better the features of resilience and sense of belonging that can help maintain psychological functioning in conditions of chronic and ongoing violence, the personal and historical antecedents of such protective factors, and the factors that can directly or indirectly undermine them.",31

Previous research has provided preliminary evidence that higher perceived discrimination is associated with higher symptoms of discrimination-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and higher discrimination-related posttraumatic growth (PTG). Further research in other contexts has shown that PTSD symptoms mediate the relationship between event severity and PTG. However, no existing studies have explored discrimination-related PTG and whether PTSD symptoms mediate the relationship between perceived discrimination and discrimination-related PTG among Muslim Americans. The current study included 110 Muslim American college students who completed an online survey assessing perceived discrimination, discrimination-related PTSD symptoms, and discrimination-related PTG. Higher perceived discrimination was significantly associated with higher discrimination-related PTG at the bivariate level. In a multivariable mediation model, the indirect effect of perceived discrimination on discrimination-related PTG via discrimination-related PTSD was statistically significant. The results suggest that clinicians working with Muslim American college students should attend to the ways in which their discriminatory experiences could foster PTG, in addition to helping them cope with PTSD symptoms.",31

The mechanisms of its development are most often explained using the cognitive model of trauma processing. The aim of the research is to determine how disturbances of core beliefs and cognitive processing in the form of coping with stress are associated with secondary traumatic stress (STS) and secondary posttraumatic growth (SPTG). The study was conducted among psychologists and social workers (N = 240), working with people after traumatic experiences. Four standardized measurement tools were used. Based on the differential diagnosis, four types of consequences were identified. Discriminant analysis was used to establish the optimal configuration of predictors explaining the differences between the four subgroups. Two significant discriminant functions were significant, each identifies different beliefs and coping strategies. The first is associated with the disruptions of core beliefs about the world and cognitive processing in the form of a non-adaptive strategy; the second—with disturbed beliefs about oneself and adaptation strategies. Our results show a much greater exposure of social workers to the negative consequences of secondary traumatic stress disorder. A system of constant monitoring should be introduced, and the principles of prevention and therapy should be implemented.",31
https://openalex.org/W4280646744,10.1017/dmp.2022.89,"Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms, Physical Illness, and Social Adjustment Among Disaster Victims","Abstract Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder is one of the most studied outcomes after a disaster. Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are maladaptive and disabling and can severely impair affected individuals’ psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Consequently, the objective of this research is to investigate the prevalence of PTSS and physical illness among disaster victims. Methods: We analyzed disaster victims’ survey data in South Korea 1 year after a natural disaster (n = 1659). Then, we performed multivariable comparisons of social and work adjustments between individuals with PTSS and individuals with physical illness to examine the association between PTSS and functional impairment. Results: Individuals with PTSS had a significant association with work and social maladjustments whether or not they had a physical illness; PTSS (+) physical illness (-) group (OR: 1.18, CI: 1.12–1.26, P &lt; 0.001) and PTSS (+) physical illness (+) group (OR: 1.16, CI: 1.08–1.23, P &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, this association was not significant in the group that exclusively presented physical illness. Conclusions: Our results suggest that PTSS might be a critical factor in social maladjustment during the post-disaster period. Subsequently, an assessment of disaster victims’ PTSS would help ensure effective medical and governmental approaches to assist disaster victims.",31

To examine how physical health symptoms developed and resolved in response to Hurricane Katrina.Methods. We used data from a 2003 to 2018 study of young, low-income mothers who were living in New Orleans, Louisiana, when Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005 (n = 276). We fit logistic regressions to model the odds of first reporting or ""developing"" headaches or migraines, back problems, and digestive problems, and of experiencing remission or ""recovery"" from previously reported symptoms, across surveys.Results. The prevalence of each symptom increased after Hurricane Katrina, but the odds of developing symptoms shortly before versus after the storm were comparable. The number of traumatic experiences endured during Hurricane Katrina increased the odds of developing back and digestive problems just after the hurricane. Headaches or migraines and back problems that developed shortly after Hurricane Katrina were more likely to resolve than those that developed just before the storm.Conclusions. While traumatic experiences endured in disasters such as Hurricane Katrina appear to prompt the development of new physical symptoms, disaster-induced symptoms may be less likely to persist or become chronic than those emerging for other reasons.",31

We examined PTSD symptoms in a cohort of U.S. Marines (N = 892) recruited for the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS). Marines deployed as one battalion infantry unit to Afghanistan in 2010 and were assessed pre-deployment and one, five, and eight months post-deployment. We employed latent transition analysis (LTA) to examine Marines' movement across PTSD symptom profiles, determined by latent class analysis (LCA). LCAs revealed a 3-class solution one month pre-deployment, a 4-class solution at five months post-deployment, and a 3-class solution at eight months post-deployment. LTA revealed notable movement between classes over time, which depended chiefly on pre-deployment symptom presentation. Marines who reported few pre-deployment symptoms either maintained these low levels or returned to low levels by eight months. Marines who reported a moderate number of symptoms at pre-deployment had variable outcomes; 50% had reductions by eight months, and those who reported numbing symptoms at five months post-deployment tended to report more symptoms at eight months. Marines who reported more PTSD symptoms prior to deployment retained more symptoms eight months post-deployment. Combat exposure and post-deployment stressor exposure predicted profile transitions. Examining transitions between latent class membership over time revealed prognostic information about Marines' eight-month PTSD outcomes. The extent of pre-deployment PTSD symptoms was particularly informative of likely PTSD outcomes.",31

Postdisaster major depression was examined in two disaster databases using consistent research methodology, permitting combination of databases into a combined dataset including 1181 survivors of 11 disasters representing all major disaster typologies with full diagnostic assessment using structured diagnostic interviews from two databases. The first database includes 808 directly-exposed survivors of 10 disasters. The second includes 373 survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York City's World Trade Center, recruited from employees of eight organizations affected by the disaster. This rich dataset permitted comparison of predictors of postdisaster major depression between databases and across survivors of different disasters. Identical models applied to both databases found postdisaster major depression to be independently associated with pre-existing major depression, indirect exposure to disaster trauma through family/friends, and disaster-related PTSD. In a final model limited to directly-exposed disaster across both databases, postdisaster major depression was independently associated with terrorism in addition to the 3 variables that predicted postdisaster major depression in the two separate databases. Replication of findings from one model to the next across different types of disasters and populations in this study suggests that these three variables could potentially provide a powerful tool for estimating likelihood of postdisaster major depression.",32

The current study explores whether EMS were related to reductions in OCD symptom severity at long-term follow-up (Mean = 8 years) after group ERP for patients with OCD. The central hypothesis was that patients with no response to treatment or patients who relapsed during the follow-up period were more likely to have elevated pre-treatment EMSs compared to those who responded to initial treatment and maintained gains over time. We also investigated whether there were any differences in change over time of overall EMS between patients who were recovered versus patients who were not recovered at extended follow-up.Young Schema Questionnaire -Short Form (YSQ-SF), Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were measured in 40 OCD patients in a general outpatient clinic before and after group ERP, after 12-months and at extended follow-up. To analyze the predictors, a multiple regression analyses was conducted. Changes in overall EMS was analyzed by mixed models procedures.The major finding is that patients with high pre-treatment YSQ-SF total scores were less likely to respond to initial treatment or were more likely to relapse between post-treatment and the extended follow-up. The YSQ-SF total score at pre-treatment explained 10.5% of the variance of extended long-term follow-up outcome. The entire sample experienced a significant reduction in overall EMS over time with largest reduction from pre- to post-test. There were no statistically significant differences in total EMS change trajectories between the patients who were recovered at the extended follow-up compared to those who were not.The results from the present study suggest that patients with higher pre-treatment EMSs score are less likely to recover in the long-term after receiving group ERP for OCD. A combined treatment that also targets early maladaptive schemas may be a more effective approach for OCD patients with elevated EMS who don't respond to standard ERP.",32

The counselling department of Ministry of Education in the Gaza Strip applied a counselling programme in the schools in order to alleviate the effect of exposure to war. The aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of the counselling programme after exposure to war-traumatic events among Palestinian children and adolescents in the Gaza Strip. Methods: The sample consists of 572 students aged 12-18 years old. Of them 331 (57.9%) were female and 241 (42.1%) were male. Traumatic events were measured by War-Traumatic Events Checklist (W-TECh). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder was measured by the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders Symptoms Scale (PTSDSS). Anxiety symptoms was adapted from The anxiety symptoms scale, and depression symptoms was measured by Child Depression Inventory. Repeated measures design was employed as the counselling programme was applied in all the schools at the same time. Specifically, the data were collected from the participants before the application of counselling programme and two months later. Results: After applying the school-based counselling programme, the prevalence of PTSD (according to DSM-V) decreased from 57.5% to 45.6% amongst the children and adolescents exposed to war-traumatic events. No gender differences were found regarding the counselling programme. Conclusions: The school-based counselling programme was effective in decreasing the PTSD symptoms amongst children and adolescents after the exposure to war-traumatic events.",32

We used the Swedish Tsunami Cohort1 consisting of 8,762 adult survivors (age ≥ 18 years in 2004) with permanent residence in Sweden who were confirmed alive through the register of the state police services in the aftermath of the tsunami. The unexposed group comprises 864,088 adults matched on sex, birth year, cohabitation status, and socioeconomic status. We retrieved clinical diagnoses of stress-related disorders (ICD-10: F43) from the Swedish Patient Register, which includes diagnoses made in specialized healthcare. Using flexible parametric models, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of stress-related disorders over the 9-year follow-up time, adjusting for pretsunami psychiatric disorders. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committees of Karolinska Institutet and Uppsala University. After register-linkage on national identifiers, unique for every Swedish resident, data analyses were done on de-identified datasets. Over the 9-year follow up, 3.6% (n = 313) of the Swedish adult tsunami survivors and 2.2% (n = 19,080) of the unexposed group received their first registered stress-related disorder diagnosis, with a corresponding elevated risk of stress-related disorders (3.56 vs. 2.19 per 1000 person-years, adjusted HR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.54, 1.93), highest for posttraumatic stress disorder (0.69 vs. 0.16 per 1000 person-years; adjusted HR 5.05, 95% CI: 3.89, 6.55). The results were similar across sexes. To assess temporal patterns, we performed an additional analysis in which we estimated separate HRs for different follow-up periods. The relative risk for stress-related disorders was substantially elevated during the first year posttsunami, decreased in magnitude thereafter, and no increased risk could be detected from 5 years and onwards (adjusted HR 1.04, 95% CI: 0.86, 1.26) (Figure 1).FIGURE 1.: Hazard ratios and 95% CIs of stress-related disorders among adult tsunami survivors as compared with matched unexposed individuals, adjusted for pre-event psychiatric history. We estimated hazard ratios from flexible parametric survival models.Our study indicates that after a transient major disaster, the dramatic rise in incidence of severe stress-related psychiatric disorders among survivors returns to unity around 5–6 years after the event. The temporal pattern of stress-related disorders in our study seems similar to research in populations suffering other types of life stressors, such as a diagnosis of a life threatening illness.4 While these results suggest that new onsets of stress-related psychiatric disorders among disaster survivors return to baseline after 5 years, we note that our previous studies of a subset of the tsunami cohort suggest that 16% of survivors are experiencing self-reported PTSD symptoms in a clinically significant range beyond 5 years after the disaster.5 Indeed, many disaster survivors with psychiatric morbidity defer seeking out treatment6 and may, as time goes by, instead seek treatment for other comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as substance abuse, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. Due to the socio-economic characteristics of the sample and the particularly benign post-disaster context, our results may reflect a conservative estimate of the increased incidence of severe stress-related disorders seen in specialized or inpatient healthcare only.

The effects of patient's age, patient's Glasgow Coma Score, level of function and consciousness, gender and relationship of the relatives were modelled.Improvement was found in both symptoms of anxiety and depression during the 12-month study period. The analysis revealed different trajectories for symptoms of anxiety and depression, as anxiety had a more rapid improvement. Higher initial level of symptoms of depression was seen in female relatives. Higher initial level of anxiety was associated with younger patient age, lower level of function and consciousness in the patient and the relative being female or the spouse.Future research and interventions should focus not only on specific deficits in the patient, but also on how the emotional state and well-being of the relatives evolve, while trying to adjust and cope with a new life-situation.",32

The participants comprised 537 students (50% male and 50% female) in the 8 th and 9 th grade who live in urban and rural areas of the northern West Bank. The researcher used the CYRM-28 scale to measure the psychological resilience and their factors (Individual Skills, Family Support, and Contextual Components). The results revealed that the mean of resilience over the Palestinian schools was quite high being significantly higher for older male students living in villages rather than cities. In order to improve resilience on Palestinian children, contextual components (spiritual, educational and cultural) and family support (physical and psychological) are key areas that could be fostered through social and educational policies.",32
https://openalex.org/W3009953895,10.1002/acp.3650,Vivid memories of distant trauma: Examining the characteristics of trauma memories and the relationship with the centrality of event and posttraumatic stress 26 years after trauma,"Summary In the present study, we investigated the phenomenological characteristics of distant trauma memories and the relationship between the vividness of trauma memories, the centrality of event and symptoms of posttraumatic stress in two groups with different types of trauma exposure, namely survivors and bereaved, from the fire on the passenger ferry, Scandinavian Star, 26 years earlier. More than two decades after the fire, the traumatic event was represented as a vivid, emotional recollection for many of the victims. For both the survivors and the bereaved, a higher degree of vividness of trauma memories and centrality of the event were associated with higher levels of posttraumatic stress. The present findings show that even very distant trauma memories can be represented as vivid recollections. Furthermore, the findings suggest that both vividness of trauma memories and event centrality may contribute to explain how posttraumatic stress reactions can remain present over a very long time.",32

Multiple linear and logistic regression with disaster exposures entered singly, combined, and as an interaction were used to model mental health.Both exposure to the oil spill and hurricane disaster were associated with likely depression and PTSD, consistent with a cumulative model, but we did not find statistical interactions that would suggest sensitization or habituation. When results were examined with continuous symptom measures of depression and PTSD, they were similar, with the exception that exposure to the oil spill and experiencing illness or injury because of the hurricane disaster showed a significant interaction (p < .05) in a manner consistent with a sensitization effect when predicting PTSD symptoms. The results of this study point mainly to a cumulative risk for the mental health effects of multiple disasters, although some indication of sensitization occurred among those with particularly severe experiences. There was no evidence for habituation.These findings may guide efforts to assist those in regions experiencing multiple disasters that occur in close sequence. (PsycINFO Database Record",32

One hundred twenty patients who had experienced a traumatic vehicle accident participated in 1 to 2 months after the accident; 70 of these people involved at 6 months after the accident. We used a hierarchical linear model analysis to verify the impacts of predictors on change of PTSD symptoms as time passed. The results showed that PTSD symptoms decreased over time, and greater perceived threat would worsen PTSD symptoms and more forgiveness would decrease PTSD symptoms. On the other hand problem-focused coping and physical injury severity were not significantly related to the PTSD symptoms. Specifically, greater perceived threat was found to be related with a deceleration of the decrease in PTSD symptoms, whereas greater forgiveness of others was associated with an acceleration of this decrease. However, problem-focused coping and physical injury severity had no influence on the change rate of PTSD symptoms. Cognitive variable could be more important than physical injury to understand PTSD. In addition, forgiveness of other in a traumatic situation needs to be considered as one of coping strategies.",32

This study used the Spiritual Well-Being Scale to examine the association of spiritual well-being with suicidal ideation/behavior, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression and alcohol use disorders in a randomized sample of Ohio Army National Guard soldiers. The participants were 418 soldiers, mostly white and male, with nearly three-quarters indicating that they had been deployed at least once during their careers. Higher spirituality, especially in the existential well-being subscale, was associated with significantly less lifetime PTSD, depression, and alcohol use disorders and with less suicidal ideation over the past year. Future research in this area may benefit from a longitudinal design that can assess spirituality and mental health behaviors in addition to diagnoses at different time points, to begin to explore spirituality in a larger context.",32

Prolonged exposure (PE) therapy is efficacious in reducing PTSD across a variety of trauma samples; however, research has not examined factors that influence how PTSD symptoms change during PE for PLWH. Using multi-level modeling, we examined the potential moderating effect of number of previous trauma types experienced, whether the index trauma was HIV-related or not, and years since HIV diagnosis on PTSD symptom reduction during a 10-session PE protocol in a sample of 51 PLWH. In general, PTSD symptoms decreased linearly throughout the PE sessions. Experiencing more previous types of traumatic events was associated with a slower rate of PTSD symptom change. In addition, LOCF analyses found that participants with a non-HIV-related versus HIV-related index trauma had a slower rate of change for PTSD symptoms over the course of PE. However, analyses of raw data decreased this finding to marginal. Years since HIV diagnosis did not impact PTSD symptom change. These results provide a better understanding of how to tailor PE to individual clients and aid clinicians in approximating the rate of symptom alleviation. Specifically, these findings underscore the importance of accounting for trauma history and index trauma type when implementing a treatment plan for PTSD in PLWH.",33

We aimed to investigate the proportion of Syrian refugee children who can be considered resilient, and applied a novel approach to identify factors predicting individual differences in mental health outcomes following war exposure.The sample included 1,528 war-exposed Syrian refugee children and their primary caregiver living in refugee settlements in Lebanon. Children were classed as having low symptoms (LS) if they scored below clinically validated cut-offs for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and externalising behaviour problems. Children scoring above any cut-off were classified as having high symptoms (HS). Each LS child was matched with one HS who reported similar war exposure, to test what differentiates children with similar exposures but different outcomes.19.3% of the children met our resilience criteria and were considered LS. At the individual level, protective traits (e.g. self-esteem; OR = 1.51, 95% CI [1.25, 1.81]) predicted LS classification, while environmental sensitivity (OR = 0.69, 95% CI [0.59, 0.82]), poorer general health (OR = 0.71, 95% CI [0.58, 0.87]) and specific coping strategies (e.g. avoidance; OR = 0.90, 95% CI [0.85, 0.96]) predicted HS classification. Social/environmental predictors included perceived social support (OR = 1.23, 95% CI [1.02, 1.49]), loneliness and social isolation (OR = 0.85, 95% CI [0.80, 0.90]), child maltreatment (OR = 0.96, 95% CI [0.94, 0.97]), and caregiver mental and general health (e.g. caregiver depression; OR = 0.94, 95% CI [0.92, 0.97]).Future research should take multiple dimensions of functioning into account when defining risk for mental health problems and consider the identified predictors as potential targets for interventions.",33
https://openalex.org/W4319918333,10.3233/jad-220892,"Genetic Liability, Exposure Severity, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Predict Cognitive Impairment in World Trade Center Responders","Background: There is a high incidence of cognitive impairment among World Trade Center (WTC) responders, comorbid with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Yet, it remains unknown whether genetic liability for Alzheimer’s disease, PTSD, educational attainment, or for a combination of these phenotypes, is associated with cognitive impairment in this high-risk population. Similarly, whether the effects of genetic liability are comparable to PTSD and indicators of exposure severity remains unknown. Objective: In a study of 3,997 WTC responders, polygenic scores for Alzheimer’s disease, PTSD, and educational attainment were used to test whether genome-wide risk for one or more of these phenotypes is associated with cognitive impairment, controlling for population stratification, while simultaneously estimating the effects of demographic factors and indicators of 9/11 exposure severity, including symptoms of PTSD. Results: Polygenic scores for Alzheimer’s disease and educational attainment were significantly associated with an increase and decrease, respectively, in the hazard rate of mild cognitive impairment. The polygenic score for Alzheimer’s disease was marginally associated with an increase in the hazard rate of severe cognitive impairment, but only age, exposure severity, and symptoms of PTSD were statistically significant predictors. Conclusion: These results add to the emerging evidence that many WTC responders are suffering from mild cognitive impairments that resemble symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, as genetic liability for Alzheimer’s disease predicted incidence of mild cognitive impairment. However, compared to polygenic scores, effect sizes were larger for PTSD and the type of work that responders completed during rescue and recovery efforts.",33

Sexual violence has many negative consequences for the victims. The most prevalent mental health issue in victims is posttraumatic stress disorder. However, a new trend in positive psychology suggests that many survivors of traumatic events, in addition to negative repercussions, adapt and develop positive personal changes, i.e., Posttraumatic growth (PTG), to mitigate their impact. This review explores the literature on posttraumatic growth among survivors of sexual violence. The review follows 5 stages of Arksey and O'Malley's framework of scoping review. 6 databases were searched using indexed terms. Approximately 65 articles were initially identified and evaluated in the preliminary search using the specified keywords. Of those retrieved, 16 met the criteria and were included in this study. Posttraumatic stress, Control over Recovery, Social Support, and Spirituality/Religiosity were the significant factors for PTG. The results suggest that fostering social support, spirituality, and a sense of control over recovery can facilitate PTG, highlighting the importance of holistic approaches in promoting resilience after trauma. Implications for practice, policy, and future directions are discussed.",33

PTSD and depression are among the most common mental health problems among refugees. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), an effective treatment for PTSD, is usually administered individually. The availability of mental health resources would be greatly enhanced when EMDR can be delivered to groups. The EMDR G-TEP is a group protocol based on Early EMDR intervention protocols. There is clinical evidence and one field study published on the effect of EMDR G-TEP and there is only one RCT published on the treatment of PTSD and depression in a refugee camp. The aim of our study was to investigate the efficacy of EMDR G-TEP in treating post-trauma symptoms and depression and preventing the development of chronic PTSD among refugees living in a refugee camp. 47 adult participants with PTSD symptoms were randomly allocated to experimental (n = 18) and control (n = 29) groups. We measured Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) at pre-, post- and 4-week follow-up. Analysis of the results showed that the EMDR G-TEP group had significantly lower PTSD and depression symptoms after intervention. The percentage of PTSD diagnosis decreased from 100 to 38.9% in the EMDR G-TEP group and was unchanged in the control group. Following the EMDR G-TEP intervention 61.1% of the experimental group no longer had a PTSD diagnosis; this decrease was maintained at 4 weeks follow-up. In the control group the percentage of people who no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD was 10.3% post-test and 6.9% at 4 weeks follow-up. A significant decrease in depression symptoms from pre-test levels was found in EMDR group but not in the control group follow up-test. This study indicated that EMDR G-TEP effectively reduced PTSD symptoms among refugees living in a camp, after two treatment sessions conducted over a period of 3 days. Further studies need to be performed using a larger number of participants, followed for a longer period of time and given more treatment sessions to strengthen our findings.",33
https://openalex.org/W2259085915,10.1017/s0033291715001798,Personality traits and combat exposure as predictors of psychopathology over time,"Background. Research suggests that personality traits have both direct and indirect effects on the development of psychological symptoms, with indirect effects mediated by stressful or traumatic events. This study models the direct influence of personality traits on residualized changes in internalizing and externalizing symptoms following a stressful and potentially traumatic deployment, as well as the indirect influence of personality on symptom levels mediated by combat exposure. Method. We utilized structural equation modeling with a longitudinal prospective study of 522 US National Guard soldiers deployed to Iraq. Analyses were based on self-report measures of personality, combat exposure, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results. Both pre-deployment Disconstraint and externalizing symptoms predicted combat exposure, which in turn predicted internalizing and externalizing symptoms. There was a significant indirect effect for pre-deployment externalizing symptoms on post-deployment externalizing via combat exposure ( p &lt; 0.01). Negative Emotionality and pre-deployment internalizing symptoms directly predicted post-deployment internalizing symptoms, but both were unrelated to combat exposure. No direct effects of personality on residualized changes in externalizing symptoms were found. Conclusions. Baseline symptom dimensions had significant direct and indirect effects on post-deployment symptoms. Controlling for both pre-exposure personality and symptoms, combat experiences remained positively related to both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Implications for diagnostic classification are discussed.",33

A separate, longitudinal study was then implemented to monitor postshooting adjustment among these same women. The present study examined predictors of MHU using data from the preshooting assessment and the following postshooting timepoints: 9 months (T1; n = 416); 14 months (T2; n = 416); 20 months (T3; n = 417); 26 months (T4; n = 405); and 33 months (T5; n = 397).Multilevel models showed preshooting emotion dysregulation and postshooting PTS and depressive symptoms positively predicted increased likelihood of MHU while controlling for covariates. Posttraumatic cognitions initially predicted increased therapy utilization, but this relationship became nonsignificant after accounting for preshooting emotion dysregulation. Preshooting emotion dysregulation also weakened the positive relationship between depressive symptoms and therapy utilization and strengthened the positive relationship between age and therapy utilization.Preshooting emotion dysregulation and postshooting mental health symptoms were the most robust predictors of increased MHU following a mass shooting. Findings suggest women exposed to a mass shooting engage in treatment when needed, but preexisting emotion dysregulation may serve as a barrier for those who go on to develop depression.

Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether individual variance in psychological distresses during the early phases post-earthquake would develop different QOL's levels among adolescent survivors 10-year after the Wenchuan earthquake.Data were extracted from the Wenchuan Earthquake Adolescent Health Cohort Study. The current study included 744 adolescent survivors who effectively completed surveys at 6 months, 24 months, and 10 years after the earthquake. Self-report questionnaires were administered to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics, earthquake exposure, life events, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and QOL. Data were analysed using hierarchical multiple regression.Trajectories of psychological distresses were classified as follow: resistance (anxiety 40.73%; depression 54.70%; PTSS 74.46%), recovery (anxiety 17.20%; depression 9.27%; PTSS 10.35%), delayed dysfunction (anxiety 10.35%; depression 18.15%; PTSS 6.18%), and chronicity (anxiety 31.72%; depression 17.88%; PTSS 9.01%). After controlling covariates, hierarchical multiple regression only revealed that the anxiety trajectory with delayed dysfunction remained significantly predictive for four domains of QOL (physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment).The current study highlights the importance of focusing on the variations in trajectories of anxiety symptoms among disaster survivors and providing individualized mental health services to improve survivors' QOL.",33

Pre-registered longitudinal moderated mediation analyses were used to test hypotheses relating to the association between cumulative risk exposure and later emotional distress; the mediating role of perceived stress in the relationship between cumulative risk exposure and later emotional distress; and, the moderating effects of peer and family adult support on the relationship between cumulative risk exposure and later perceived stress, among N = 19,159 adolescents over three annual waves (at ages 11/12, 12/13, 13/14). Analyses revealed that cumulative risk exposure significantly predicted later adolescent emotional distress. This relationship was partially mediated by perceived stress. Both peer and family adult support significantly moderated the impact of cumulative risk exposure on later perceived stress (i.e., adolescents reporting higher levels of support perceived significantly lower levels of stress resulting from cumulative risk exposure compared to those reporting lower levels of support). These findings provide critical empirical evidence of the roles played by perceived stress and social support in the relationship between cumulative risk exposure and adolescent emotional distress, with consequent implications for intervention.",34

This study submits that psychological resilience to potentially traumatic events can be determined by the ratio of recovery from distressing experiences to the level of posttraumatic distress symptoms. We hypothesize that this ratio will be predicted by 3 resilience‐supporting variables: community resilience, sense of coherence, and a low level of exposure to adversity. I further hypothesized that sense of coherence will mediate the links of the other two predictors and the measure of resilience. The sample included 233 Druze high school students whose hometown was endangered and damaged by the Mount Carmel wildfire, on December 2010. Results that supported these hypotheses are discussed in terms of supporting the proposed measure of resilience and its applicability in explaining posttraumatic outcomes.",34

Prior to deployment, participants completed measures of depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms, along with an inventory of predeployment stressor experiences. At 3-months postdeployment, participants (468 men, 60 women) again completed self-report measures of psychiatric symptoms, along with an inventory of sexual stressors experienced during deployment. We compared a cross-sectional model of sexual stressors' impact on psychiatric symptoms, in which only postdeployment reports were considered, to a longitudinal model in which we adjusted for participants' predeployment stressors and psychiatric symptoms. No participants reported sexual assault during deployment, though sexual harassment was common. The cross-sectional model suggested that deployment-related sexual stressors were significantly associated with postdeployment depression (R(2) = .11) and posttraumatic stress symptoms (R(2) = .10). Once predeployment factors were taken into consideration, however, sexual stressors were no longer significant. The results did not support the notion of lasting negative impact for low-level sexual stressors (e.g., sexual harassment) during deployment after predeployment stressors are accounted for. Future studies of sexual stressors should consider longitudinal designs.",34

Furthermore, mothers and children are especially vulnerable postdisasters. Despite the rise in the frequency of climate-related disasters and also the threat of disasters (e.g., storms that threaten but do not make landfall), little is known about how predisaster experiences are associated with mothers' and children's postdisaster psychological functioning. This study examined evacuation-related stressors as predictors of mothers' and youths' psychological functioning 3 months after Hurricane Irma.Mothers (N = 535; 33% ethnic/racial minorities) from South Florida counties most affected by Hurricane Irma completed an online survey that assessed evacuation-related stressors (both pre- and posthurricane), hurricane exposure (i.e., life threat, loss/disruption), and posthurricane social support and mental health symptomatology (i.e., PTSS, anxiety, depression). Mothers of children aged 7-17 years (n = 226) also reported on their child's psychological functioning.Using a risk and resilience model, evacuation stressors significantly predicted mothers' and youths' PTSS and symptoms of anxiety and depression, even after accounting for demographic factors, hurricane exposure, and availability of social support. Mothers of older children also reported significantly higher levels of PTSS, anxiety, and depression than mothers who only had young children (aged 6 or younger) at home.Evacuation experiences represent significant stressors that may put mothers and children at risk for PTSS and psychological distress. Resilience-building efforts should include efforts to better prepare families for prestorm evacuations, thereby reducing risk in mothers and youth and ultimately contributing to better psychosocial functioning.

Methods: HGS was assessed utilizing a computer-assisted hand dynamometer administered to a consecutive sample of men and women (n = 2016) who participated in rescue and recovery efforts following the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks and subsequently attended monitoring appointments in Long Island, NY. PTSD symptom severity and depressive symptoms were assessed using the PTSD specific-trauma checklist (PCL-S) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). General linear models were used to examine the association of WTC-related PTSD with HGS after adjusting for confounders. Results: The sample was at midlife (mean age = 53.3) when assessed, and 91.3% were men. Nearly 10% of the sample had probable PTSD (PCL ≥ 44) with concomitant depression (PHQ ≥ 10), while 5.1% had probable PTSD without depression. Average HGS was 57.4 lbs. (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 56.6⁻58.1) among men and 36.1 lbs. (95% CI = 33.8⁻38.5) among women. Mean HGS of those with probable PTSD with concomitant depression was lower (45.9 lbs., 95% CI = 43.6⁻48.2) than responders with only PTSD (49.1 lbs., 95% CI = 46.0⁻52.4) and those without PTSD or depression (57.5 lbs., 95% CI = 56.2⁻57.8). Subdomain analyses of PTSD symptoms revealed that re-experiencing symptoms at enrollment (p = 0.003) was associated with lower HGS after adjusting for depressive symptoms and other confounders. Discussion: Results suggested that higher WTC-related PTSD symptom severity was associated with lower HGS. Results support ongoing work suggesting that PTSD may be associated with more rapid physical aging. The potential for developing interventions that might simultaneously improve physical and mental health in the aftermath of trauma may be considered.",34

Peritraumatic dissociation, the complex process of disorientation, depersonalization, and derealization during a trauma, has been a consistent predictor of PTSD. Experiences of frequent racial discrimination may increase the propensity for peritraumatic dissociation in the context of new traumatic experiences and contribute to PTSD symptoms. However, the role of peritraumatic dissociation in the relationship between experiences of discrimination and PTSD has not been specifically explored.Objective: The current study investigated the role of peritraumatic dissociation in the impact of racial discrimination on PTSD symptoms after a traumatic injury, and the moderating role of gender.Method: One hundred and thirteen Black/African American individuals were recruited from the Emergency Department at a Level I Trauma Center. Two weeks after the trauma, participants self-reported their experiences with racial discrimination and peritraumatic dissociation. At the six-month follow-up appointment, individuals underwent a clinical assessment of their PTSD symptoms.Results: Results of longitudinal mediation analyses showed that peritraumatic dissociation significantly mediated the effect of racial discrimination on PTSD symptoms, after controlling for age and lifetime trauma exposure. A secondary analysis was conducted to examine the moderating role of gender. Gender was not a significant moderator in the model.Conclusions: Findings show that racial discrimination functions as a stressor that impacts how individuals respond to other traumatic events. The novel results suggest a mechanism that explains the relationship between racial discrimination and PTSD symptoms. These findings highlight the need for community spaces where Black Americans can process racial trauma and reduce the propensity to detach from daily, painful realities. Results also show that clinical intervention post-trauma must consider Black Americans' experiences with racial discrimination.Peritraumatic dissociation operates as a mechanism through which racial discrimination predicts posttraumatic symptoms in an adult trauma sample.Racial discrimination functions as a stressor that increases the risk for trauma-related symptoms.The lived experiences of Black Americans elicit the use of emotional detachment strategies that may mitigate effects of racial discrimination but increase the risk for peritraumatic dissociation.",34

https://openalex.org/W2996295594,10.1037/ort0000434,Parental trajectories of PTSD and child adjustment: Findings from the Building a New Life in Australia study.,"Evidence suggests that the psychosocial adjustment of children of refugees may be compromised when a parent has symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We sought to determine whether trajectories of parental PTSD symptoms might relate to child adjustment and whether there is an additive effect when both parents, as opposed to just one, has prominent PTSD symptoms. We report data from the first three years of a prospective study of recent Australian humanitarian migrants: the Building a New Life in Australia study. Parental PTSD symptoms were assessed on three occasions, and latent class growth analysis was used to identify homogenous groups of parents based on their PTSD symptoms. The Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire was administered to assess child psychosocial adjustment. Regression analyses were then conducted to determine whether trajectories of parental PTSD symptoms predicted child adjustment. After controlling for child age and gender, the presence of either one or both parents with persistently high PTSD symptoms was associated with children's having greater emotional difficulties and poorer overall psychosocial adjustment. Children with both parents with persistently high PTSD had higher levels of emotional difficulties than did children with a single parent with high PTSD symptoms. For emotional difficulties, though not other domains of child psychosocial adjustment, there indeed appears to be an additive impact of having two parents, rather than just one, with persistently high PTSD symptoms, although the magnitude of these effects was small. The clinical and service provision implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",34

Methods Ten adolescents meeting full diagnostic criteria for PTSD were recruited from a specialized outpatient mental health clinic and offered a standardized intensive PE . The intensive PE consisted of three daily 90‐min exposure sessions delivered on five consecutive weekdays, followed by 3 weekly 90‐min booster sessions. In a single‐trial design, the participants were randomly allocated to one of five baseline lengths (4–8 weeks) before starting the intensive PE . Before, during, and after intensive PE completion, self‐reported PTSD symptom severity was assessed weekly as a primary outcome (a total of 21 measurements). Furthermore, clinician‐administered PTSD diagnostic status and symptom severity (primary outcome), as well as self‐reported comorbid symptoms (secondary outcomes), were assessed at four single time points (baseline‐to‐6‐month follow‐up). Results Time‐series analyses showed that self‐reported PTSD symptom severity significantly declined following treatment ( p = .002). Pre‐postgroup analyses demonstrated significant reductions of clinician‐administered PTSD symptom severity and self‐reported comorbidity that persisted during the 3‐ and 6‐month follow‐ups (all ps &lt; .05), where 80% of adolescents had reached diagnostic remission of PTSD . There was neither treatment dropout nor any adverse events. Conclusions The results of this first proof of concept trial suggest that intensive PE can be effective and safe in an adolescent population with complex PTSD , although the gains achieved need to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial.",34

Setting: In-person interviews at US Army installations (postdeployment); phone interviews (long-term follow-up). Participants: A total of 378 US Army soldiers and veterans deployed to Iraq; 14.3% ( n = 54) reported TBI with loss of consciousness during an index deployment. Design: Participants were evaluated after returning from deployment and again 5 to 9 years later. Main Measures: Temporal consistency of TBI endorsement based on TBI screening interviews; PTSD Checklist, Civilian Version. Results: The concordance of deployment-related TBI endorsement from the postdeployment to long-term follow-up assessment was moderate (κ = 0.53). Of the 54 participants reporting (predominantly mild) TBI occurring during an index deployment, 32 endorsed TBI inconsistently over time. More severe PTSD symptoms at postdeployment assessment were independently associated with discordant reporting ( P = .0004); each 10-point increase in PCL scores increasing odds of discordance by 69% (odds ratio = 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.26). Conclusions: Deployment-related TBI may not be reported reliably over time, particularly among war-zone veterans with greater PTSD symptoms. Results of screening evaluations for TBI history should be viewed with caution in the context of PTSD symptom history.",34

Feeling moderately/extremely bothered by graphic media images was associated with hyperarousal symptoms in exposed participants.The findings suggest that media contact did not lead to psychopathology in exposed individuals, although it was associated with normative distress in both exposure groups. Because of the potential for adverse effects associated with media contact, clinicians and public health professionals are encouraged to discuss concerns about mass trauma media contact with their patients and the public at large.",35

Using latent profile analysis, three classes of symptoms (resilient, thriving, and struggling) were identified at 8 and 20 months after the earthquake. Latent transition analysis indicated that the majority of survivors remained in the same class during the period, while others showed a transition between different classes over time. The transition was mainly characterized by three paths: from struggling to resilient, and from thriving to either resilient or struggling. Of the survivors who were classified as thriving at 8 months, those transitioning to the struggling class at 20 months were more likely to experience higher levels of loss and injury compared with those transitioning to the resilient class (Cohen's d = 0.72) or remaining in the thriving class (Cohen's d = 0.36) at 20 months postearthquake. Survivors who remained stable in the struggling class were older than those who remained stable in the thriving class (Cohen's d = 0.41) or those who moved from thriving at 8 months to resilient at 20 months after the earthquake (Cohen's d = 0.39). It is recommended that clinicians consider the classes of posttraumatic stress symptoms and posttraumatic growth, and the potential development paths and associated factors, when implementing interventions for children and adolescents after a natural disaster.",35

However, evidence is lacking with respect to how anger changes over a deployment cycle, and which factors prospectively influence change in anger among combat-deployed soldiers. Methods Reports of problematic anger were obtained from 7298 US Army soldiers who deployed to Afghanistan in 2012. A series of mixed-effects growth models estimated linear trajectories of anger over a period of 1–2 months before deployment to 9 months post-deployment, and evaluated the effects of pre-deployment factors (prior deployments and perceived resilience) on average levels and growth of problematic anger. Results A model with random intercepts and slopes provided the best fit, indicating heterogeneity in soldiers' levels and trajectories of anger. First-time deployers reported the lowest anger overall, but the most growth in anger over time. Soldiers with multiple prior deployments displayed the highest anger overall, which remained relatively stable over time. Higher pre-deployment resilience was associated with lower reports of anger, but its protective effect diminished over time. First- and second-time deployers reporting low resilience displayed different anger trajectories (stable v . decreasing, respectively). Conclusions Change in anger from pre- to post-deployment varies based on pre-deployment factors. The observed differences in anger trajectories suggest that efforts to detect and reduce problematic anger should be tailored for first-time v . repeat deployers. Ongoing screening is needed even for soldiers reporting high resilience before deployment, as the protective effect of pre-deployment resilience on anger erodes over time.",35

Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, resulting in massive destruction and unprecedented mortality. <h3>Objective</h3> To determine the magnitude of disaster exposure and mental health outcomes among Puerto Rican youths after Hurricane Maria. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> Survey study in which a school-based survey was administered to each public school student at all schools in Puerto Rico between February 1 and June 29, 2018 (5-9 months after Hurricane Maria). Of the 226 808 students eligible to participate, 96 108 students completed the survey. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Participants were assessed for exposure to hurricane-related stressors, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depressive symptoms, using standardized self-report measures administered in Spanish. Descriptive statistics were compiled for all outcome variables, as was the frequency of individuals reporting clinically elevated symptoms of PTSD or depression. Differences in these statistics across sexes were also examined via<i>t</i>tests. Correlations between demographic, geographic, and main outcome variables were also calculated, and regressions were conducted to examine their association with symptoms of PTSD. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 96 108 students participated in the study (42.4% response rate; 50.3% female), representative of grades 3 to 12 across all 7 educational regions of Puerto Rico. As a result of the hurricane, 83.9% of youths saw houses damaged, 57.8% had a friend or family member leave the island, 45.7% reported damage to their own homes, 32.3% experienced shortages of food or water, 29.9% perceived their lives to be at risk, and 16.7% still had no electricity 5 to 9 months after the hurricane. Overall, 7.2% of youths (n = 6900) reported clinically significant symptoms of PTSD; comparison of the frequency of reporting clinically elevated symptoms of PTSD across sex yielded a significant difference (<i>t</i> = 12.77; 95% CI of the difference, 0.018-0.025;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), with girls (8.2%) exceeding the clinical cutoff score more often than boys (6.1%). Finally, similar analysis of differences in depression between sexes was also significant (<i>t</i> = 17.56; 95% CI of the difference, 0.31-0.39;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), with girls displaying higher mean (SD) scores (2.72 [3.14]) than boys (2.37 [2.93]). Demographic and risk variables accounted for approximately 20% of variance in symptoms of PTSD (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.195; 95% CI, 0.190-0.200). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Survey results indicate that Hurricane Maria exposed Puerto Rican youths to high levels of disaster-related stressors, and youths reported high levels of PTSD and depressive symptoms. Results are currently being used by the Puerto Rico Department of Education to inform targeted and sustainable evidence-based practices aimed at improving mental health outcomes for Puerto Rico’s youths.",35

Less is known about whether and how people can preserve subjective wellbeing in the presence of psychopathology. We examined to what extent psychopathology can co-exist with acceptable levels of subjective wellbeing and which personal strengths and resources moderate the association between psychopathology and wellbeing.Questionnaire data on wellbeing (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life/Happiness Index), psychological symptoms (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales), and personal strengths and resources (humor, Humor Style questionnaire; empathy, Empathy Quotient questionnaire; social company; religion; daytime activities, Living situation questionnaire) were collected in a population-based internet study (HowNutsAreTheDutch; N = 12,503). Data of the subset of participants who completed the above questionnaires (n = 2411) were used for the present study. Regression analyses were performed to predict wellbeing from symptoms, resources, and their interactions.Satisfactory levels of wellbeing (happiness score 6 or higher) were found in a substantial proportion of the participants with psychological symptoms (58% and 30% of those with moderate and severe symptom levels, respectively). The association between symptoms and wellbeing was large and negative (-0.67, P < .001), but less so in persons with high levels of self-defeating humor and in those with a partner and/or pet. Several of the personal strengths and resources had a positive main effect on wellbeing, especially self-enhancing humor, having a partner, and daytime activities.Cultivating personal strengths and resources, like humor, social/animal company, and daily occupations, may help people preserve acceptable levels of wellbeing despite the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.",35

The aim of the study was to evaluate the maintenance of treatment gains achieved in a comparative study of effectiveness of prolonged exposure therapy for adolescents (PE-A) and supportive counselling (SC) in adolescents with PTSD up to 24-months post-treatment. Method Sixty-three adolescents (13–18 years) with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive either of the interventions comprising 7–14 sessions of treatment provided by trained and supervised non-specialist health workers (NSHWs). The primary outcome measure was PTSD symptom severity, as independently assessed on the Child PTSD Symptom Scale, at pretreatment, post-treatment, and at 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-months post-treatment follow-up (FU) evaluations. Results Participants in both the prolonged exposure and SC treatment groups attained a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms and maintained this reduction in PTSD symptoms at 12- and 24-month assessment. Participants receiving prolonged exposure experienced greater improvement on the PTSD symptom severity scale than those receiving SC at 12-months FU [difference in PE-A v . SC mean scores = 9.24, 95% CI (3.66–14.83), p &lt; 0.001; g = 0.88] and at 24-months FU [difference in PE-A v . SC mean scores = 9.35, 95% CI (3.53–15.17), p = 0.002; g = 0.68]. Conclusions Adolescents with PTSD continued to experience greater benefit from prolonged exposure treatment than SC provided by NSHWs in a community setting 12 and 24 months after completion of treatment.",35

All crash survivors that were admitted to the intensive or sub-intensive care units of selected hospitals in Greece, Germany and Italy over one year period (2013-2014), were invited to participate in the study and were interviewed at three different time-points as follows: (a) at one month (baseline data), (b) at six months, and (c) at twelve months. The study used widely recommended classifications for injury severity (AIS, MAIS) and standardized health outcome measures such as the Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHODAS 2.0) to measure disability, ""Impact of Event Scale"" (IES-R) to measure Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) to measure depression. A total of 120 patients were enrolled in the study in all the partner countries and 93 completed all follow up questionnaires. The risk of physical disability was 4.57 times higher [CI 1.98-2.27] at the first follow up and 3.43 times higher [CI 1.43-9.42] at the second follow up as compared with the time before the injury. There was a 79% and an 88% lower risk of depression at the first and the second follow up respectively, as compared with the baseline time. There was also a 72% lower risk of Post-Traumatic Stress at the second follow up as compared with the baseline time. A number of factors relevant to the individuals, the road crash and the injury, were shown to distinguish those at higher risk of long-lasting disability and psychological distress including age, marital status, type of road user, severity and type of the injury, past emotional reaction to distress. The study highlights the importance of a comprehensive and holistic understanding of the impact of injury on an individual and further underlines the importance of screening and treating psychological comorbidities in injury in a timely manner.",35

So far, there are no studies that investigate the secondary and primary traumatization of this group of first responders. We included N = 75 volunteers, who filled out questionnaires to assess their secondary (QST/FST) and primary traumatization (PDS), and levels of comorbid psychological stress (PHQ-9, GAD-7, SF-12). We investigated factors of resilience by measuring attachment behavior (ECR-RD, RQ-2), level of personality functioning (OPD-SFK), sense of coherence (SOC-29), social support (F-SozU), and mindfulness (MAAS). The volunteers' levels of secondary and primary traumatization were below cut-off scores. Their levels of comorbid psychological stress were comparable to representative norm samples. Additionally, the volunteers presented high levels of resilience. Gender (β = 0.26; p < 0.05), case discussions (β = -0.37; p < 0.05), and social support (β = 0.45; p < 0.01) were revealed to be predictors of secondary traumatization, while mindfulness turned out to be a predictor of primary traumatization (β = -0.34; p = 0.008). However, we cannot rule out that the low prevalence of traumatization and comorbid psychological stress in our study sample might not be explained by a positive response bias.",35

Data were collected via structured interviews and self-report questionnaires 1 month prior to deployment and again at 1, 5, and 8 months postdeployment. Second-order growth mixture modeling was used to disaggregate symptom trajectories; multinomial logistic regression and relative weights analysis were used to assess the role of combat exposure, prior life span trauma, social support, peritraumatic dissociation, and avoidant coping as predictors of trajectory membership. Three trajectories best fit the data: a low-stable symptom course (79%), a new-onset PTSD symptoms course (13%), and a preexisting PTSD symptoms course (8%). Comparison in a separate MRS cohort with lower levels of combat exposure yielded similar results, except for the absence of a new-onset trajectory. In the main cohort, the modal trajectory was a low-stable symptoms course that included a small but clinically meaningful increase in symptoms from predeployment to 1 month postdeployment. We found no trajectory of recovery from more severe symptoms in either cohort, suggesting that the relative change in symptoms from predeployment to 1 month postdeployment might provide the best indicator of first-year course. The best predictors of trajectory membership were peritraumatic dissociation and avoidant coping, suggesting that changes in cognition, perception, and behavior following trauma might be particularly useful indicators of first-year outcomes.",35
https://openalex.org/W2557172843,10.1037/tra0000215,Association of peritraumatic dissociation with symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.,"In this study, we evaluated whether peritraumatic dissociation (PD) was associated with symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and whether this association was modified by trauma prior to police work.Symptoms of depression, PTSD, peritraumatic dissociative experience (PDE), and trauma prior to police work were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, PTSD Checklist-Civilian, PDE questionnaire, and the Brief Trauma questionnaire, respectively, in 328 police officers. Separate regression models were used to assess if either symptoms of depression or PTSD were associated with PD stratified by prior trauma. Means were adjusted for race, number of drinks per week, and smoking.PD was associated with symptoms of PTSD and depression (β = 0.65, p < .001 and β = 0.27, p < .001, respectively). PD was positively associated with symptoms of PTSD regardless of prior trauma (β = 0.61, p < .001(without prior trauma), 0.75, p < .001 (with prior trauma). In contrast to PTSD, depression symptoms were significantly associated with PD scores in individuals with prior trauma (β = 0.47, p < .001), but not in individuals without prior trauma (β = 0.13, p = .165).This is a cross-sectional study. Outcomes were obtained via self-report and were not clinically diagnosed. Aspects of both the trauma event as well as the symptoms and severity of PD may have introduced recall bias.These results add to the literature indicating that PD plays a role in symptoms of PTSD and depression and how prior trauma may modify this relationship.

We evaluated the extent to which diverse personality and psychiatric symptom dimensions predict mTBI recovery.This prospective cohort study involved psychological assessments of hospital patients with mTBI (n = 75; median = 2 days post-injury, range = 0-12 days) and orthopedic trauma controls (OTC; n = 79) who were used for comparison in mediation modeling. Chronic symptoms were evaluated at 3 months after mTBI (n = 50) using the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) symptom checklist. Linear regression analyses were used to identify the predominant predictors of chronic symptoms in mTBI. Modern mediation analyses tested the hypothesis that personality traits predict chronic symptoms through acute psychological response to injury.In mTBI, trait psychoticism directly predicted chronic mTBI symptoms and was the strongest personality predictor overall. Furthermore, an internalizing personality dimension emphasizing negative affect/emotionality and detachment predicted chronic mTBI symptoms indirectly through enhancement of acute somatic complaints. In OTC, internalizing personality acted through the same mediator as in mTBI, whereas the effect of psychoticism was also mediated through acute somatic complaints. There was varying support for a moderated direct effect of personality traits at low levels of positive emotionality across models.These causal models provide novel insights about the role of personality in mTBI symptom recovery, highlighting the complexity of how psychological processes may interact to affect recovery and revealing that some of these processes may be non-specific to brain injury.",35

We used data from 5,748 spouses and service members with two to five years of service (90% female spouses, Mage = 27.54), all having experienced at least one deployment. The impact of deployment risks (number of prior deployments, combat exposure, deployment injury) and resources (formal and informal support, communication during the last deployment) were analyzed within a path modeling framework. Mediators of these relations were investigated, including service member and spouse mental health and spouse deployment-related personal growth. We found a well-fitting model suggesting a combination of direct and indirect effects on spouse perception of deployment readiness. Findings indicated that service member combat and injury negatively impacted spouse perception of deployment readiness through detriments to service member and spouse mental health. However, informal support and deployment communication were positively related to mental health for both partners, leading to improved spouse-perceived deployment readiness. Additionally, all resources contributed to spouses’ personal growth, a relatively strong mechanism for spouse-perceived deployment readiness. These findings suggest application through promotion of resources or by directly targeting mediating mechanisms to offset deployment risk.",36

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of PTSD in this population.PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, Google Scholar and Cochrane library were searched until June 2020. To estimate the prevalence of PTSD, sub-group and meta-analysis were conducted.The search resulted in 2786 studies, of which 28 articles representing 32 samples with a total of 15,121 participants from Gaza Strip and West Bank met either the DSM-4 or DSM-5 criteria and were included. The pooled prevalence of PTSD was 36% (95% CI 30-41%; I2 98.6%) and ranged from 6% to 70%. Sub-group analysis showed that the PTSD prevalence did not differ according to region (West Bank, Gaza Strip) and tended to decrease after including only studies using a representative sample (p<0.001), and among those with low risk of bias (p<0.001). Visual inspection of the included studies revealed significant discrepancies in study design and assessment measures.We identified high prevalence of PTSD among Palestinian children and adolescents exposed to political violence. However, the pooled results should be interpreted with caution, due to the high heterogeneity and risk of bias in the included studies. These limitations also reflect the challenge in conceptualizing and measuring PTSD in the Palestinian context with a background of continuous and cumulative trauma. Understanding the contextual factors and developing locally adapted survey measures are of relevance to future research, public health planning, and the provision of mental healthcare in Palestine.",36

These odds decreased over time, with greater reductions for the HI and mTBI groups compared with TCs. By day 14, there were no group differences in PCS. In addition, only the HI group reported higher initial levels of anxiety and a steeper slope relative to TCs.Patients with HI, regardless of whether they meet the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicines definition of mTBI, have higher odds of typical PCS immediately postinjury, but faster rates of recovery than TCs. ESM can improve understanding the dynamic nature of postinjury PCS.",36

Aims To assess the potential mental health impact of this initiative we examined gender differences in deployment patterns, work strain, occupational factors, mental health, alcohol use and help-seeking following operational deployment. Methods The study was a secondary analysis of self-report survey data; 8799 men (88%) and 1185 women (12%) provided data. A sub-sample (47%, n = 4659) provided data concerning post-deployment help-seeking. The latter consisted of 408 women (8.8%) and 4251 men (91%). Results With the exception of alcohol misuse, which was significantly lower for women, women reported significantly more common mental disorder symptoms, subjective depression and self-harm. Women were significantly more likely to seek help from healthcare providers. Men were significantly more likely to have deployed operationally and for longer cumulative periods. Subjective work strain, but not job control, was significantly lower for women whose military careers were significantly shorter. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom intensity was similar to men. Conclusions With the exception of PTSD and alcohol misuse, UK military women experience more mental health-related problems than military men. This finding was not related to the more arduous aspects of military service as women served for shorter times, deployed less and for shorter cumulative periods and were less likely to report work-related stress.",36

Data for adult enrollees in the WTC Health Registry, a prospective cohort study, were linked to New York State (NYS) administrative hospitalization data to identify alcohol- and drug-related hospitalizations from enrollment to December 31, 2010. Logistic regression was used to analyze the associations between substance use-related hospitalization, 9/11-related exposure and PTSD. Of 41,176 NYS resident enrollees, we identified 626 (1.5%) who had at least one alcohol- or drug-related hospitalization; 53.4% (n = 591) of these hospitalizations were for alcohol only diagnoses and 46.6% (n = 515) were drug-related. Witnessing ≥3 traumatic events on 9/11 was significantly associated with having a drug-related hospitalization (AOR 1.4, 95% CI = [1.1, 1.9]). PTSD was significantly associated with both having a drug-related hospitalization as well as an alcohol only-related hospitalization. (AOR 2.6, 95% CI = [2.0, 3.3], AOR 1.8, 95% CI = [1.4, 2.3], respectively). Witnessing traumatic events and having PTSD were independently associated with substance use-related hospitalizations. Targeting people who witnessed traumatic events on 9/11 and/or who have PTSD for substance use- treatment could reduce alcohol and drug-related hospitalizations connected to 9/11.",36

Methods: Incidence of MCI was assessed in a clinical sample of WTC responders (N = 1800) who were cognitively intact at baseline assessment. Crude incidence rates were calculated and compared to population estimates using standardized incidence ratios. Multivariable analyses used Cox proportional-hazards regression. Results: Responders were 53.1 years old (SD = 7.9) at baseline. Among eligible cognitively intact responders, 255 (14.2%) developed MCI at follow-up. Incidence of MCI was higher than expected based on expectations from prior published research. Incidence was higher among those with increased PTSD symptom severity, and prolonged exposure was a risk factor in apolipoprotein-e4 carriers. Conclusions: PTSD and prolonged WTC exposures were associated with increased incidence of MCI in WTC responders, results that may portend future high rates of dementia in WTC-exposed responders.",36

However, the pandemic has demonstrated heterogeneous mental health effects, suggesting that individual-level factors could play a role in buffering or exacerbating its deleterious impact. This study aimed to understand how individual differences in resilience were associated with trajectories of obsessive-compulsive, depression, and anxiety symptoms among healthy adults and those with OCD residing in New York City, considered the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States at its onset. The sample consisted of healthy individuals (n = 30) and people with OCD (n = 33) who completed clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires that assessed baseline resilience, OCD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and perceived positive effects of the pandemic at four assessment timepoints: baseline (April 2020) and one, two, and six months later. Linear mixed-effects growth models revealed that greater resilience was associated with stable trajectories of symptoms over time. Conversely, less resilience was associated with worsening obsessive-compulsive symptoms from the two-month to six-month assessment timepoints and worsening depressive symptoms at six months across both groups, and with worsening anxiety symptoms in individuals with OCD at six months. Resilience was correlated with the ability to appreciate ""silver linings"" of the pandemic. These findings highlight resilience as a potential treatment target for bolstering mental health outcomes among individuals with and without psychopathology during sustained and unprecedented periods of stress.",36

The aim was to investigate the relationship between perceived parenting styles and attachment relationships and child mental health, as reported by 322 Syrian refugee minors aged between 8 and 17 years in Turkey. Child-rated scales included the Children Revised Impact of Event Scale-8 (CRIES-8), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Security Scale and Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran for Children (EMBU-C), and were used as measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), general mental health problems, attachment relationships and perceived parenting styles, respectively. Children with secure maternal and paternal attachment perceived their parents as less rejecting, while children with secure paternal attachment also reported their parents as emotionally warmer. Attachment relationships significantly contributed in predicting PTSD after controlling for age and gender, while conduct problems were predicted by lack of emotional warmth, rejection and over-protection by both parents, in addition to insecure attachment relationships. Refugee children's views are essential in establishing their needs and planning interventions. These should address both the impact of trauma and current family relationships.",36

We report on a multi-institutional collaboration to collect long-term patient-centered outcomes after trauma, including screening for post-traumatic stress disorder. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for the development of post-traumatic stress disorder after traumatic injury. Methods Adult trauma patients (aged 18–64) with moderate to severe injuries (Injury Severity Score ≥ 9) admitted to 3 level I trauma centers were screened between 6 and 12 months after injury for post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients were divided by mechanism: fall, road traffic injury, and intentional injury. Multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the association between baseline patient and injury-related characteristics and the development of post-traumatic stress disorder for the overall cohort and by mechanism of injury. Results A total of 450 patients completed the screen. Overall 32% screened positive for post-traumatic stress disorder, but this differed significantly by mechanism, with the lowest being after a fall (25%) and highest after intentional injury (60%). Injury severity was not associated with post-traumatic stress disorder for any group, but lower educational level was associated with post-traumatic stress disorder within all the groups. Only 21% of patients who screened positive for post-traumatic stress disorder were receiving treatment at the time of the survey. Conclusion Post-traumatic stress disorder is common after traumatic injury, and the prevalence varies significantly by injury mechanism but is not associated with injury severity. Only a small proportion of patients who screen positive for post-traumatic stress disorder are currently receiving treatment.",36
https://openalex.org/W4286434163,10.1002/jts.22857,Identifying and predicting posttraumatic stress symptom states in adults with posttraumatic stress disorder,"Between-person heterogeneity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is well established. Within-person analyses and the DSM-5 suggest that heterogeneity may also be evident within individuals across time as they move through social contexts and biological cycles. Modeling within-person symptom-level fluctuations may confirm such heterogeneity, elucidate mechanisms of disorder maintenance, and inform time- and person-specific interventions. The present study aimed to identify and predict discrete within-person disorder presentations, or symptom states, and explore group-level patterns of these states. Adults (N = 20, 60.0% male, M age = 38.25 years) with PTSD responded to symptom surveys four times per day for 30 days. We subjected each individual's dataset to Gaussian finite mixture modeling (GFMM) to uncover latent, within-person classes of symptom levels (i.e., states) and predicted those states with idiographic elastic net regularized regression using a set of time-based and behavioral predictors. Next, we conducted a GFMM of the within-person GFMM outputs and tested idiographic prediction models of these states. Multiple within-person states were revealed for 19 of 20 participants (Mdn = 4; 66 for the full sample). Prediction models were moderately successful, M AUC = .66 (d = 0.58), range: .50-1.00. The GFMM of the within-person model outputs revealed two states: one with above-average and one with below-average symptom levels. Prediction models were, again, moderately successful, M AUC = .66; range: .50-.89. The findings provide evidence for within-person heterogeneity of PTSD as well as between-person similarities and suggest that future work should incorporate additional contextual variables as symptom state predictors.",36

Questionnaires were collected approximately every 3 to 6 months between ages 9 and 24 years. Parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Adult Behavior Checklist (ABCL), and Developmental Behaviour Checklist anxiety- and depression-related subscale distributions were modeled with mixed-effects Poisson models, covarying diagnosis, age, verbal IQ (VIQ), gender, and significant 2- and 3-way interactions.Anxiety was positively associated with VIQ, and controlling for VIQ, both anxiety and depressive symptoms were greater in ASD than nonspectrum participants. Female gender predicted greater increases over time in anxiety and depressive symptoms for both diagnostic groups. Lower maternal education was associated with increasing internalizing symptoms in a subset of less verbal individuals with ASD. In exploratory post hoc analyses, internalizing symptoms were associated with poorer emotional regulation in school age, and with lower life satisfaction and greater social difficulties in early adulthood.Findings support previous claims that individuals with ASD are at particular risk for affect- and anxiety-specific problems. Although symptom levels in females increase at a faster rate throughout adolescence, males with ASD appear to have elevated levels of depressive symptoms in school age that are maintained into young adulthood.",36

However, there have been few studies on how comorbid PTSD may impact ED treatment outcomes.Participants were 2,809 patients from residential ED treatment facilities who were treated using the Unified Treatment Model (UTM). We investigated whether PTSD diagnosis at admission was associated with changes in Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) scores, binge eating, self-induced vomiting, and restriction, across three time points, as well as clinically significant improvement and treatment drop-out.Using latent growth models, with time modeled as a second-order polynomial, we found that EDE-Q scores and behavioral symptoms decreased from admission to discharge, but increased from discharge to 6-month follow-up. PTSD diagnosis was associated with higher baseline EDE-Q scores and restriction, and lower binge-eating frequency. PTSD diagnosis was not associated with symptom change over time, treatment dropout, or clinically significant change.Although PTSD diagnoses were associated with higher ED symptom levels at admission, PTSD was not associated with worse treatment outcomes, suggesting the UTM is a promising treatment for patients with and without PTSD. Future studies should investigate the impact of ED treatment on PTSD symptoms in order to determine the need for integrated treatments for these comorbid conditions.",37

One communication key is building trust. Disaster survivors encounter journalists in a high-stress context, but little is known about their perceptions of these interactions and the subsequent media exposure. The aim of this study is to explore how survivors 6 years after a major disaster perceived their encounters with journalists and exposure in the media, as well as their level of trust in the media, compared with government and authorities. Data were used from a longitudinal study of Swedish tourists, repatriated from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, surveyed up to 6 years after the tsunami to assess posttraumatic stress (PTS) and effects on mental health. At 6 years after, the survey included questions about survivors' perceptions of journalist interactions (reported by n = 311), of their own media exposure ( n = 177), and survivors' trust in media organizations and public authorities ( n = 1,181). Tsunami survivors mainly perceived interactions with journalists as being professional. There were 14% who reported that the interactions were supportive and 17% that the interactions were a strain. Similarly, most participants had a neutral view concerning the subsequent media coverage or exposure, although 12% experienced media exposure as stressful and 12% reported that it had been involuntary. Finally, the survivors indicated higher confidence and trust in Swedish radio and TV as compared to the Swedish authorities, and the participants' level of trust in the media was associated with their perceptions of journalists, r = 0.34, p &amp;lt; 0.001, and media coverage, r = 0.47, p &amp;lt; 0.001. Disaster survivors mainly agreed with emotionally neutral statements about interacting with the media, the performance of journalists on site, and their own media exposure. Nonetheless, a substantial minority found the encounters and exposure to be negative, and the results suggest a link between personal experiences or perceptions and trust in the media.",37

Yet, limited research has utilized longitudinal research designs and there is a scarcity of research looking at the three most commonly implicated mental health factors-posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and alcohol use-within the same study. Research is especially scarce for women veterans, who experience substantial risk for these mental health concerns and experiencing IPV. This study examined the role of PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, and alcohol use in increasing risk for experiencing future IPV while simultaneously accounting for the impact of recent IPV experience on subsequent mental health. This study included a sample of 1921 women veterans (Mage = 36.5), who were asked to complete three mail surveys over the course of 8 months as part of a larger longitudinal survey study of US veterans' health and well-being. The survey assessed experiences of IPV, PTSD symptoms (PCL-5), depression symptoms (PHQ-9), and alcohol use (AUDIT-C) at each of the three time points. Results from separate path analysis models provided support for the role of PTSD symptoms and depression symptoms (but not alcohol use) in increasing risk for IPV experience over time. However, the path analysis models provided little support, with the exception of PTSD, for the impact of IPV experience on subsequent mental health symptoms. Findings point to the importance of better understanding the mechanisms by which PTSD and depression symptoms can increase risk for IPV to inform theory and prevention and treatment efforts. Detection and treatment of PTSD and depression symptoms among women may help reduce risk for future violence in intimate relationships.",37

PTSD symptoms related to a traumatic event during the most recent deployment were assessed in four annual waves in 2010–2013 among 682 Reserve Component soldiers. Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) was used to examine the longitudinal trajectories of PTSD symptoms. The association between the PTSD trajectories and suicidal ideation at waves 2 to 4 was examined in logistic regression analyses. Four trajectories were identified: resilience (73.0%), recovery (11.7%), late onset (11.6%) and chronic (3.6%). Pairwise comparisons demonstrated significant differences between trajectories in risk of suicidal ideation. Among the chronic trajectory group, 50.9% reported suicidal ideation (25.8% late onset group; 11.3% recovery group; 4.0% resilience group). After controlling for baseline characteristics, the late onset and chronic trajectory groups were more likely to have suicidal ideation than the resilience and recovery trajectories, respectively. Findings suggest the late onset and chronic trajectories of PTSD symptoms are associated with higher risk of suicidal ideation. They support the importance of follow-up assessment of suicide risk even among individuals with low PTSD symptoms at homecoming.",37

Research has been limited by an assumption that children with concussion are a homogenous group. OBJECTIVE To identify (i) distinctive postconcussive recovery trajectories in children and (ii) injury-related and psychosocial factors associated with these trajectories. METHODS This study is part of a larger prospective, longitudinal study. Parents of 169 children (5-18 yr) reported their child's PCS over 3 mo following concussion. PCS above baseline levels formed the primary outcome. Injury-related, demographic, and preinjury information, and child and parent mental health were assessed for association with trajectory groups. Data were analyzed using group-based trajectory modeling, multinomial logistic regression, and chi-squared tests. RESULTS We identified 5 postconcussive recovery trajectories from acute to 3 mo postinjury. (1) Low Acute Recovered (26.6%): consistently low PCS; (2) Slow to Recover (13.6%): elevated symptoms gradually reducing; (3) High Acute Recovered (29.6%): initially elevated symptoms reducing quickly to baseline; (4) Moderate Persistent (18.3%): consistent, moderate levels of PCS; (5) Severe Persistent (11.8%): persisting high PCS. Higher levels of child internalizing behaviors and greater parental distress were associated with membership to the Severe Persistent group, relative to the Low Acute Recovered group. CONCLUSION This study indicates variability in postconcussive recovery according to 5 differential trajectories, with groups distinguished by the number of reported symptoms, levels of child internalizing behavior problems, and parental psychological distress. Identification of differential recovery trajectories may allow for targeted early intervention for children at risk of poorer outcomes.",37

The literature has shown a significant relationship between Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms and lowered academic achievement in children. This longitudinal study investigated the relationships between attendance, academic achievement, and PTSD symptoms following Hurricane Katrina. Participants were 343 mother-child dyads recruited from public and private schools within Orleans Parish, Jefferson Parish, and East Baton Rouge Parish 4-7 months following Hurricane Katrina. Children completed the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index, the BASC-2 Self Report of Personality, and the Hurricane-Related Traumatic Experiences (HURTE). Mothers completed the Childhood Routines Inventory and a demographic questionnaire. Finally, children’s test scores from the Iowa Test of Basic Skills and the Louisiana Educational Assessment Program were collected. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that PTSD symptom severity following Hurricane Katrina was negatively correlated with post-storm achievement after accounting for pre-storm achievement and attendance. PTSD symptom severity was not a significant predictor of post-storm attendance after accounting for pre-storm attendance. Inattention/Hyperactivity served as a mediator between PTSD symptom severity and achievement in one of the three measured years (2008). Finally, pre-storm academic achievement did not serve as a moderator in the relationship between hurricane exposure and PTSD symptom severity. Clinical implications and recommendations for future research are discussed.",38

This study aimed at clarifying mediation processes between injury severity and mother's, father's, and young child's acute stress.Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships between injury severity and parental and child acute stress. Parents of 138 burn-injured children (ages 1-4 years) completed standardized questionnaires on average 19 days postinjury.Sixteen children (11.7%) met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, preschool criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (excluding time criterion). The model revealed a significant mediation of maternal acute stress, with the effect of injury severity on a child's acute stress mediated by maternal acute stress. Paternal acute stress failed to serve as a mediating variable.Our findings confirm mothers' crucial role in the posttraumatic adjustment of young children. Clinically, mothers' acute stress should be monitored.",38

However, cross-sectional study designs have made it difficult to understand the role of mental health in the etiology of persistent PCS.Participants were 3319 military personnel (primarily men [90%] of 25-34 years [54%]) who had completed health surveys at basic training and after deployment, on average, 4.6 years later. Negative binomial regression was used to assess the association of PCS with demographic covariates, premilitary mental health and somatic symptoms, combat experiences and mTBI during deployment, in addition to postdeployment mental health and non-PCS somatic symptoms.Premilitary mental health and somatic symptoms predicted PCS even when adjusting for other variables, yielding an elevated incidence rate ratio (IRR) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; IRR = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-1.41) and somatic symptoms (mild versus minimal somatic symptoms: IRR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.31-1.55; moderate/severe versus minimal somatic symptoms: IRR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.43-2.06), but not for depressive symptoms. When postdeployment mental health and somatic symptom measures were added to the model, the effect of premilitary somatic symptoms remained significant.Findings point to potential etiological contributions of premilitary characteristics, particularly a tendency to experience somatic symptoms and PTSD, as well as mTBI and combat experiences, to the development of PCS.

Research has not determined if PTSD symptoms correspond with more negative expectations of parenthood and unrealistic beliefs regarding children's developmental milestones. Negative and unrealistic preparenthood and developmental expectations are tied to problematic parenting-related outcomes; thus, these beliefs are important to examine within the context of PTSD. The aim of the current study was to examine whether PTSD is related to negative parenthood expectations as well as more unrealistic perceptions of children's development. Included in the study were 368 trauma-exposed adults who had yet to become parents (Mage = 25.92 years, SD = 7.11; 68.2% female; 63.8% White). Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that probable PTSD was associated with more negative parenting expectations, βs = -.08--.16. Alterations in cognitions and mood were associated with more negative perceptions of parenthood, βs = .10--.31. However, higher levels of intrusion symptoms were related to more positive expectations of parenthood and more realistic development expectations, βs = .17-.25. The data were a satisfactory fit for the model. Thus, PTSD may be relevant in understanding perceptions of parenthood, which may be important to address and ultimately improve parenting outcomes among parents with PTSD.Spanish Abstracts by Asociación Chilena de Estrés Traumático (ACET) Trastorno de estrés postraumático y percepciones de la paternidad y los hijos TEPT Y EXPECTATIVAS DE LOS PADRES El trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) puede aumentar el riesgo de consecuencias adversas relacionadas con la crianza. La investigación no ha determinado si los síntomas de TEPT se corresponden con expectativas más negativas de la paternidad y creencias poco realistas con respecto a hitos del desarrollo de los niños. Una predisposición negativa y poco realista de la paternidad y expectativas del desarrollo están vinculadas a consecuencias problemáticas relacionadas con la crianza; por lo tanto, es importante examinar estas creencias dentro del contexto del trastorno de estrés postraumático. El objetivo del presente estudio fue examinar si el TEPT estaba relacionado con las expectativas de paternidad negativas, así como con percepciones poco realistas del desarrollo de los niños. En el estudio se incluyeron 368 adultos expuestos a traumas que aún tenían que convertirse en padres (M edad = 25.92 años, SD = 7.11, 68.2% mujeres, 63.8% blancos) fueron incluidos en el estudio. El modelo de ecuación estructural (SEM en sus siglas en inglés) reveló que el TEPT probable se asoció con expectativas de crianza más negativas, βs = -08 - .16. Las alteraciones en las cogniciones y el estado de ánimo se asociaron con percepciones más negativas de la paternidad, βs = .10 - .31. Sin embargo, los niveles más altos de síntomas de intrusión se relacionaron con expectativas más positivas de la paternidad y expectativas de desarrollo más realistas, βs = .17-.25. El modelo tenía un ajuste adecuado. Por lo tanto, el TEPT puede ser relevante para comprender las percepciones de la paternidad, lo que puede ser importante para abordar y, en última instancia, mejorar los resultados de la paternidad entre los padres con TEPT.Traditional and Simplified Chinese Abstracts by the Asian Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (AsianSTSS) 簡體及繁體中文撮要由亞洲創傷心理研究學會翻譯 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Perceptions of Parenthood and Children Traditional Chinese 標題: 創傷後壓力症與對成為家長及對孩子的感知 撮要: 創傷後壓力症(PTSD)有可能提高不良的育兒相關情況的風險。過往研究未能確定PTSD症狀是否跟對成為家長有較負面的期望、及對孩子的成長里程碑有較不切實際的信念有所關係。對成為家長和對孩子的成長有負面和不切實際的期望, 跟育兒相關的問題有關。因此, 我們有需要檢視這些重要信念對PTSD患者產生的影響。本研究目的為檢視PTSD是否與對成為家長有負面的期望及對孩子的成長有較不切實際的感知相關。樣本為368名受創而未成為家長的成人(Mage = 25.92 歲, SD = 7.11; 68.2% 女性; 63.8% 白人)。結構性方程模型(SEM)反映, 有可能患PTSD跟對成為家長有較負面的期望有關(βs = -.08--.16)。認知和心情改變, 跟對成為家長有較負面的感知有關(βs = .10--.31)。可是, 有較高水平的侵擾症狀, 跟對成為家長有較正面的期望及對孩子成長有較實際的期望有關(βs = .17-.25)。模型適切性令人滿意。因此, PTSD可能有助我們了解個人對成為家長的感知, 那對於我們認識和改善患PTSD的家長其育兒情況可能是關鍵。 Simplified Chinese 标题: 创伤后压力症与对成为家长及对孩子的感知 撮要: 创伤后压力症(PTSD)有可能提高不良的育儿相关情况的风险。过往研究未能确定PTSD症状是否跟对成为家长有较负面的期望、及对孩子的成长里程碑有较不切实际的信念有所关系。对成为家长和对孩子的成长有负面和不切实际的期望, 跟育儿相关的问题有关。因此, 我们有需要检视这些重要信念对PTSD患者产生的影响。本研究目的为检视PTSD是否与对成为家长有负面的期望及对孩子的成长有较不切实际的感知相关。样本为368名受创而未成为家长的成人(Mage = 25.92 岁, SD = 7.11; 68.2% 女性; 63.8% 白人)。结构性方程模型(SEM)反映, 有可能患PTSD跟对成为家长有较负面的期望有关(βs = -.08--.16)。认知和心情改变, 跟对成为家长有较负面的感知有关(βs = .10--.31)。可是, 有较高水平的侵扰症状, 跟对成为家长有较正面的期望及对孩子成长有较实际的期望有关(βs = .17-.25)。模型适切性令人满意。因此, PTSD可能有助我们了解个人对成为家长的感知, 那对于我们认识和改善患PTSD的家长其育儿情况可能是关键。.",38

A sample of 1,278 Chinese adolescents (54.0% girls) with a mean age of 13.4 years (SD = 0.8, range = 12-16) completed 2-wave surveys 2.5 and 3.5 years after a major disaster. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV, the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children, and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders. Latent class analyses identified 4 classes characterized by high, reexperiencing/hypervigilance, dysphoria, and low symptoms, respectively at each time point. Latent transition analyses revealed relatively high levels of temporal stability within low symptom and dysphoria classes but relatively high probabilities of migration from re-experiencing/hypervigilance and high symptom classes into lower symptom classes. Multinomial logistic regression analyses found that some of the between-class movements during the year were predicted by baseline distress or fear disorders. This study provides an initial depiction of both quantitative and qualitative changes in youth's long-term PTSD symptom patterns over time and gives a further elucidation of other forms of posttrauma psychopathology's impacts on PTSD course. These findings carry implications for ongoing evaluation and adjustable intervention individually tailored to youth's PTSD manifestations and comorbidities in the long-term disaster aftermath.",38

While much is known regarding the short-term negative impact of C-SA, the current study examines whether C-SA is associated with immediate academic and psychosocial consequences as well as long-term poorer mental health (depression, posttraumatic stress [PTS], anxiety) and interpersonal functioning (relationship quality, sexual and emotional intimacy). In addition, the current study explores potential moderators of these associations, including race, the nature of the assault, resulting injury, relation to perpetrator, and whether the assault was reported. A stratified design was used comparing women who experienced C-SA ( n = 201) to women with no C-SA history (n = 203) controlling for age, education, race, and ethnicity. Results from a series of repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) demonstrated that across race and ethnicity, women with a history of C-SA reported lower grade-point averages, more missed classes, and fewer serious romantic relationships in college following the assault. Furthermore, results from a series of linear and logistic regression revealed that approximately 9 years later, women who experienced C-SA reported greater symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTS as well as lower emotional and sexual intimacy. These associations differed by a number of assault variables (assault type, relation to perpetrator, amount of fear reported, physical injuries sustained, whether the assault was reported, whether medical treatment was sought). The current study further confirms the significant and pervasive impact of C-SA associated with women’s health and functioning, warranting further intervention to both reduce the incidence of C-SA and expand the reach of existing mental health interventions to survivors.",38

We investigated over time associations using data from the Pre-Post Deployment Study component of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS). Married soldiers (N = 2,585) reported on their marital distress, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms 1 month before deploying to Afghanistan and 3 months and 9 months after they returned home. The data were analyzed using cross-lagged panel models, adjusting for a variety of demographic and military covariates (including deployment stress, measured 1 month after homecoming). Results indicated (a) no associations between marital distress and mental health symptoms during the 13-month lag from predeployment to postdeployment, (b) bidirectional associations between marital distress and symptoms of anxiety and depression during the 6-month lag from 3 to 9 months after homecoming, and (c) a unidirectional association from PTSD symptoms to marital distress during the 6-month lag from 3 to 9 months after homecoming. These findings shed light on a lingering debate about the directionality of the longitudinal association between marital distress and psychopathology. They also imply points of intervention to help buffer military personnel from the harmful effects of marital distress and mental health symptoms across the deployment cycle.

Post-traumatic growth is a positive psychological change in which an individual develops stronger functioning, beliefs, and values following a trauma. To date, no quantitative analysis has been done of post-traumatic growth in young adult burn survivors. The present study aims: (1) to delineate the overall level of post-traumatic growth among Korean young adult burn survivors, and (2) to investigate the factors that influence the post-traumatic growth. To accomplish this, data for 221 burn survivors in a burn hospital and self-help groups were analyzed. Young adult burn survivors were found to have experienced post-traumatic growth, although to a lesser degree than previous research would suggest (36.86 ± 31.16). Results of the hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that change in a family relationship after the burn experience, treatment situation, and level of interpersonal relationship skills, were statistically significant in young adult burn survivors' post-traumatic growth. Results support good interpersonal relationship skills and positive family relationships appear to facilitate the positive growth after burn experience. Clinical implications are presented in the discussion.",38

However, the underlying relationship between PTSD and depression remains unclear. Objective: This study examines the relationship between PTSD and depressive symptoms in children who survived the Wenchuan earthquake in China. Methods: In total, 301 children were assessed at four months and then followed up at 29, 40 and 52 months after the disaster. The ages of the children ranged from 9.6-14.6 years old, and the sample included 157 males and 144 females. The children were assessed by using the University of California at Los Angeles PTSD reaction index for DSM-IV for PTSD symptoms and the Children's Depression Inventory for depressive symptoms. Results: Comorbid PTSD and depressive symptoms were prevalent in 4.0, 3.3, 3.7 and 5.1% of the participants at times 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The cross-lagged analysis indicated that PTSD symptoms at time 1 predicted depressive symptoms at time 2; depressive symptoms at time 1 predicted PTSD symptoms at time 2; depressive symptoms at time 2 predicted PTSD symptoms at time 3; and depressive symptoms at time 3 predicted PTSD symptoms at time 4. The findings also showed that being female, poor parental relationships and trauma exposure were risk factors for PTSD or depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The results suggest that the causal relationship between PTSD and depressive symptoms changes over time; the effects of PTSD symptoms tend to decrease, while those of depressive symptoms tend to increase. Two stages of the relationship between PTSD and depressive symptoms were observed, namely, that PTSD and depressive symptoms first influenced each other and then that depressive symptoms predicted PTSD. The results of our study also suggest that females with poor parental relationships and a high degree of trauma exposure are more likely to require intervention.Antecedentes: Muchos estudios han reportado la comorbilidad del trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) y depresión en niños. Sin embargo, la relación subyacente entre TEPT y depresión permanece poco clara.Objetivo: Este estudio examina la relación entre TEPT y síntomas depresivos en niños que sobrevivieron al terremoto de Wenchuan en China.Métodos: En total, 301 niños fueron evaluados a los 4 meses y luego en seguimiento a los 29, 40 y 52 meses después del desastre. Los rangos de edades de los niños fueron entre 9,6-14,6 años y la muestra incluyó 157 hombres y 144 mujeres. Los niños fueron evaluados usando el índice de reacción de TEPT de la Universidad de California en Los Ángeles para los síntomas de TEPT según el DSM-IV y para los síntomas depresivos el Inventario de Depresión para Niños.Resultados: La comorbilidad TEPT y síntomas depresivos tuvieron una prevalencia de un 4,0%, 3,3%, 3,7% y 5,1% de los participantes a los tiempos 1, 2, 3 y 4, respectivamente. El análisis cruzado indicó que los síntomas de TEPT en el tiempo 1 predijo los síntomas depresivos al tiempo 2, y que los síntomas depresivos al tiempo 1 predijeron síntomas de TEPT al tiempo 2; los síntomas depresivos al tiempo 2 predijeron síntomas de TEPT al tiempo 3; y síntomas depresivos al tiempo 3 predijeron síntomas de TEPT al tiempo 4. Los hallazgos también mostraron que ser mujer, malas relaciones parental y exposición a trauma fueron factores de riesgo para TEPT o síntomas depresivos.Conclusiones: Los resultados sugieren que la relación causal entre TEPT y síntomas depresivos cambia en el tiempo; los efectos de los síntomas de TEPT tienden a disminuir, mientras que los síntomas depresivos tienden a aumentar. Se observaron dos estadíos de relación entre los síntomas de TEPT y depresivos, esto es, que primero el TEPT y síntomas depresivos se influyen mutuamente y luego, los síntomas depresivos predijeron el TEPT. Los resultados de nuestro estudio también sugieren que las niñas con malas relaciones parentales y alto grado de exposición a trauma son las que probablemente requieren mayor intervención.背景：许多研究报告了儿童创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）和抑郁的共病。然而，PTSD和抑郁症之间的潜在关系仍不清楚。目的：本研究探讨中国汶川地震幸存儿童中PTSD与抑郁症状之间的关系。方法：对汶川地震幸存的301名儿童进行灾后4个月的随访，并在灾后29个月、40个月和52个月进行随访。 儿童的年龄在9.6到14.6岁之间，样本包括157名男性和144名女性。 通过使用加州大学洛杉矶分校的DSM-IV PTSD反应指数来评估儿童的PTSD症状，使用《儿童抑郁症量表》评估抑郁症状。结果：在第1、2、3和4次随访期，共病PTSD和抑郁症状的患病率分别为4.0％，3.3％，3.7％和5.1％。交叉滞后分析表明，第1次随访的PTSD症状预测在第2次随访的抑郁症状，第1次随访时的抑郁症状预测第2次随访的PTSD症状; 第2次随访的抑郁症状预测第3次随访的PTSD症状; 第3次随访的抑郁症状预测了第4次随访的PTSD症状。研究结果还表明，女性、较差的父母关系和创伤暴露是PTSD或抑郁症状的危险因素。结论：结果表明PTSD与抑郁症状之间的因果关系随时间而变化; PTSD症状的影响趋于减少，而抑郁症状的影响趋于增加。 观察到PTSD和抑郁症状之间存在两个阶段的关系，即PTSD和抑郁症状首先相互影响，然后抑郁症状预测PTSD。 我们的研究结果还表明，与父母关系不佳和高度创伤暴露的女性更可能需要干预。.",38

Several studies have also revealed that indirect exposure to trauma might be accompanied by positive psychological changes. This study examined secondary posttraumatic growth (SG) among adult children of former prisoners of war (ex-POWs' children) who were compared with adult children of comparable veterans (controls' children). Furthermore, we examined the role of five-factor personality traits in the associations between exposure to stress stemming from fathers' behaviors, ST symptoms, and SG. Participants were Israeli ex-POWs' children (N = 98) and controls' children (N = 90), whose fathers fought in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Results show that ex-POWs' children reported higher levels of SG compared with controls' children. ST symptoms were found to mediate the association between research group and SG, and the direct effect was found to be conditioned at the levels of participants' extroversion. Furthermore, among ex-POWs' children, extroversion and openness to the experience personality traits, as well as exposure to stress, were found to predict SG. Forty years after the war ended, the experience of living with ex-POWs is associated with ex-POWs' children SG that might be more related to their exposure to stress and personality traits than their ST symptoms. Clinical interventions aiming to increase the levels of SG among indirect victims of captivity should consider the influence of pretrauma resources, trauma characteristics, and posttrauma factors.

The objective was twofold: (a) to identify the prevalence of exposure to traumatic events and (b) to examine the symptoms of traumatic stress in children as described by their parents or tutors using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Data from 1,850 male and female children aged between 6 and 15 years living in the Gaza Strip were collected throughout the months of February and April 2015, that is 6 months after the attack. Results showed that the majority of the children were exposed to bombardments and residential area destruction (83.51%), were confined at home unable to go outside (72.92%), were witness to the profanation of mosques (70.38%), were exposed to combat situations (66.65%), and saw corpses (59.95%). A sample of 275 males (28.3%) and 232 females (26.5%) showed diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Gender and age were independent of PTSD. The presence of this pathology was positively related to the number of trauma events experienced. The type of traumatic experience was hardly related to age and gender. A greater protection on behalf of the families against exposure to traumatic events could explain these differences.",39

However, three alternative models (i.e., anhedonia model, externalizing behavior model, and hybrid model) of PTSD fit the DSM-5 symptom criteria better than the DSM-5 factor model. Thus, the psychometric performance of the DSM-5 and alternative models’ PTSD factor structure needs to be critically evaluated. The current study examined whether gender or trauma directness (i.e., direct or indirect trauma exposure) moderates the PTSD latent structure when using the DSM-5 or alternative models. Model performance was evaluated with measurement invariance testing procedures on a large undergraduate sample (n=455). Gender and trauma directness moderated the DSM-5 PTSD and externalizing behavior model and did not moderate the anhedonia and hybrid models' latent structure.

We analyzed data from 596 unique individuals (13.86% of total dataset; 70.81% male; Mage=40.11 years, SDage=17.49 years; 7.59% non-English-speaking background) with moderate-severe TBI who had complete data on all personal and injury-related variables (collected on admission) and emotional data at 3 or more time-points. There were 464 participants at the 1-year post-injury time-point, 485 at 2 years, 454 at 3 years, 450 at 5 years, and 248 at 10 years.Not applicable.The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).Visualization of the individual HADS symptoms (line graph) showed that the most highly endorsed symptoms at each time-point were feeling slowed down and restlessness. On average, each symptom reduced across the first decade post-TBI, with an overall mild level of emotional distress at 10 years. However, visualization of participants' individual trajectories based on the HADS total score (Sankey diagram) revealed significant heterogeneity. Using latent class analysis, we identified 5 distinct trajectory types based on the HADS total score: ""Gradual Improving"" (38.93%), ""Resilience"" (36.41%), ""Gradual Worsening"" (10.40%), and 2 non-linear trajectories of ""Worsening-Remitting"" (8.22%) and ""Improving-Relapsing"" (6.04%). Middle age at injury, lower Glasgow Coma Scale score, comorbid spinal and limb injuries, and receipt of pre-injury mental health treatment predicted earlier and/or worsening post-injury emotional distress.Emotional distress across the first decade after moderate-severe TBI is dynamic, heterogeneous, and often chronic, underscoring a need for ongoing monitoring and responsive treatment.",39

Methods: The participant pool consisted of male 9/11 responders enrolled in the Stony Brook World Trade Center Health Program (WTC-HP), one of five centers of excellence established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fatigue severity was assessed with the Fatigue Severity Scale. WTC-related medical conditions were certified by a physician and diagnoses of 9/11-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) were determined with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Results: High fatigue severity was reported by 20.8% of the sample (N = 1079) and was significantly associated with PTSD, major depressive disorder, sleep apnea, gastro-esophageal reﬂux disease, upper respiratory disease, and lower respiratory disease. These associations remained significant for PTSD, major depressive disorder and lower respiratory disease when adjusted for medications, age and BMI. Only 17.3% of the high fatigue subgroup did not have an identified medical or psychiatric diagnosis. Fewer fatigued (21.1%) than non-fatigued (72.0%) responders rated their physical health as ‘good’ or ‘very good.’ Also fewer fatigued (33.9%) than non-fatigued (54.1%) responders were employed full-time (p < .0001). Conclusions: This study found clinically elevated fatigue in a high percentage of a male WTC responder cohort that prior to 9/11/2001 would be considered a ‘healthy worker cohort.’ To better understand the pathophysiology of fatigue, newer methodologies such as symptom provocation (e.g. exercise) designs may be useful.",39

Previous studies have found that optimism protects against PTSD and depression, whereas pessimistic causal thinking and karma beliefs are associated with depression soon after a trauma. The objective of this study is to examine whether these factors continue to be associated with psychological health among Sri Lankan coastal residents 8 years after the tsunami. A semi-structured survey was conducted in 5 coastal districts. Three hundred twenty-five participants had direct exposure to the tsunami whereas 105 were indirectly or non-exposed. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between the three psychological predictors and health outcomes, adjusting for relevant covariates including exposure to the tsunami, gender, age, education, and health before the tsunami. Optimism showed an association with lower depression and better self-reported health. Belief in karma was associated with a higher risk of PTSD symptoms. Internal attribution style was associated with PTSD and depression as well. These findings suggest that optimism, causal thinking, and karma belief play a role in long-term psychological health after a disaster and should be studied further and targeted for interventions.",39

This can lead to a greater risk of developing mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can impact individuals and communities. Research suggests that the severity of the reactions to traumatic events is likely to be influenced by the level of exposure to the traumatic events and personal characteristics. This paper examines the correlation between symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and various factors such as the extent of exposure to missile alarms, personal traits, and socioeconomic elements among Israeli civilians impacted by rocket attacks from Hamas. Our specific focus is on the influence of these rocket attacks on Israel's populace during the military operation conducted by the Israeli army, ""Guardian of the Walls,"" in May 2021.Our findings suggest that, typically, individuals who have experienced less exposure to missile attacks and alarms, those belonging to larger families, and those with a higher level of education and income are less prone to experiencing post-traumatic symptoms. The study was carried out using surveys that gathered demographic information about the participants, as well as a specific questionnaire designed to evaluate the presence and extent of post-trauma symptoms.These findings could aid in devising preventative strategies to mitigate the PTSD risk among vulnerable groups. They indicate the importance of considering socio-economic elements when delivering mental health services to those impacted by violent incidents and trauma.",39

We applied the spatial scan statistic (SaTScan) and geographically weighted regression.We found spatial clusters of high likelihood wellness in areas north of Texas City and spatial concentrations of low likelihood wellness in Galveston Island. Geographic variation was found in predictors of wellness, showing increasing associations with both forms of wellness the closer respondents were located to Galveston City in Galveston Island.Predictors for postdisaster wellness may manifest differently across geographic space with concentrations of lower likelihood wellness and increased associations with predictors in areas of higher exposure. Our approach could be used to inform geographically targeted interventions to promote mental health and general wellness in disaster-affected communities.",39

However, no clear consensus has been reached regarding the postdisaster trajectories of PTSD among children.Objective: The current study examined the trajectories of PTSD among children after exposure to the Wenchuan earthquake and explored potential predictors of distinct PTSD trajectories.Methods: A four-year longitudinal study was conducted to follow 301 children who were evaluated for PTSD symptoms following the Wenchuan earthquake. Trauma exposure and some pre-existing characteristics were measured at four months after the disaster, and PTSD symptoms were measured at 4, 16, 29, 40 and 52 months after the disaster. The trajectories were identified with Latent Growth Mixture Modelling, and the predictors were explored with multinomial logistic regression.Results: The following three latent PTSD trajectories were found among children: resilient (74.9%), relapsing (17.7%) and recovery (7.5%). Trauma exposure was more likely to be related to a more severe trajectory of PTSD, having experienced prequake trauma was more likely to be related to the recovery trajectory and school 2 was more likely to be related to the relapsing trajectory.Conclusion: These findings provide novel insights into children’s postdisaster response patterns. Individual heterogeneity existed in posttraumatic reactions. This longer-term longitudinal study captured more detailed and accurate information about the development of these trajectories.

However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying comorbid PTSD following Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) have not been fully investigated, especially among children. This study prospectively examined the influence of theorized neurocognitive deficits at 3 months post pediatric TBI on the development of PTSD symptoms 6 months postinjury.One hundred sixty-six children aged between 6 and 14 years were recruited after sustaining a TBI. Their demographic information and injury severity were assessed at 2 months postinjury, their neurocognitive outcomes in selective attention, sustained attention, verbal learning, working memory, and processing speed were assessed at 3 months postinjury, and PTSD symptoms were measured at 6 months postinjury.Consistent with the Neurobiological Theory of PTSD, sustained attention deficits 3 months postinjury emerged as the key predictor for greater future PTSD severity at 6 months, especially following a mild TBI. However, contrary to the expectations of the Emotional Processing Theory and Dual Representation Theory, verbal learning and working memory deficits at 3 months postinjury protected children from the development of PTSD symptoms 6 months postinjury.PTSD involves a complex interplay between attention and memory functions post pediatric TBI. When trauma memory is relatively intact, difficulties disengaging from distractors contribute to the development of PTSD symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record",39

Methods: Calculated age and sex adjusted incidence rates of mental and behavioral conditions determined by validated instruments and electronic medical records. Results: Of 10,671 service members, 3,379 (32%) deployed between baseline and follow-up, of whom 49% reported combat experience. Combat deployers had highest incidence rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (25 cases/1,000 person-years [PY]), panic/anxiety (21/1,000 PY), and any mental disorder (34/1,000 PY). Nondeployers had substantial rates of mental conditions (11, 13, and 18 cases/1,000 PY). Among combat deployers, 12% screened positive for mental disorder, 59% binge drinking, 16% alcohol problem, 19% cigarette smoking, and 20% smokeless tobacco at follow-up. Of those with recent PTSD, 73% concurrently developed >1 incident mental or behavioral conditions. Of those screening positive for PTSD, 11% had electronic medical record diagnosis. Conclusions: U.S. service members joining during recent conflicts experienced high rates of mental and behavioral disorders. Highest rates were among combat deployers. Most cases were not represented in medical codes, suggesting targeted interventions are needed to address the burden of mental disorders among service members and Veterans.",39

This study aims to examine whether or not there are differences in long-term outcomes for individuals with chemical burn injuries compared to those with fire/flame injuries. Methods Data from the Burn Model System (BMS) National Database (1997–2019) were used for analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics of adult burn survivors with chemical injuries and fire/flame injuries were compared. Regression analyses for the Mental Health Composite Scale (MCS) and the Physical Health Composite Scale (PCS) of the Short Form Health Survey-12, employment status, and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) were conducted at 12 and 24 months post-burn, adjusting for age, gender, race, and burn size. Results A total of 2,522 database participants (96 with chemical burns; 2,426 with fire/flame injuries) were included in the analyses. Those with chemical injuries had smaller burn sizes, shorter hospital stays, and fewer ventilator days (p&amp;lt; 0.0001, p=0.0034, and p=0.0005, respectively). Chemical burn survivors were more likely to be employed at the time of the burn (p&amp;lt; 0.0001), to have sustained an employment-related injury (p&amp;lt; 0.0001), and to have been discharged to their own home following their acute stay (p&amp;lt; 0.0001). No significant differences in the MCS, PCS, employment status or SWLS were found at either 12 or 24 months post-burn between groups in the regression analyses. Conclusions Chemical burn injuries were not found to have a significant difference on mental health, physical health, employment status, and satisfaction with life outcomes compared to fire/flame injuries. However, the effects of chemical burn injury on long-term outcomes may be difficult to detect due to the relatively small sample size of this population. Applicability of Research to Practice Further investigation is needed to better understand long-term outcomes following chemical injuries. Individuals with chemical burn injuries may require more specific assessment tools to improve how these types of injuries are studied.",40

We therefore investigated the extent to which premorbid adjustment trajectories predict cognitive remediation gains in schizophrenia.In a total sample of 215 participants (170 first-episode schizophrenia participants and 45 controls), we classified premorbid functioning trajectories from childhood through late adolescence using the Cannon-Spoor Premorbid Adjustment Scale. For the 62 schizophrenia participants who underwent 6 months of computer-assisted, bottom-up cognitive remediation interventions, we identified MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery scores for which participants demonstrated mean changes after intervention, then evaluated whether developmental trajectories predicted these changes.Growth mixture models supported three premorbid functioning trajectories: stable-good, deteriorating, and stable-poor adjustment. Schizophrenia participants demonstrated significant cognitive remediation gains in processing speed, verbal learning, and overall cognition. Notably, participants with stable-poor trajectories demonstrated significantly greater improvements in processing speed compared to participants with deteriorating trajectories.This is the first study to our knowledge to characterize the associations between premorbid functioning trajectories and cognitive remediation gains after schizophrenia onset, indicating that 6 months of bottom-up cognitive remediation appears to be sufficient to yield a full standard deviation gain in processing speed for individuals with early, enduring functioning difficulties. Our findings highlight the connection between trajectories of premorbid and postmorbid functioning in schizophrenia and emphasize the utility of considering the lifespan developmental course in personalizing therapeutic interventions.",40

This study aims to investigate the developmental trajectory of mother–child interaction longitudinally using latent growth model analysis. Methods A longitudinal descriptive survey study was conducted. The participants comprised of 1,614 mothers and school-aged children, who participated in the Panel Study on Korean Children (6th–8th panel surveys). A model was designed and analyzed using latent growth modeling to estimate the pattern of change over time. Results In the group where the maternal depression was within the normal range, only the path by which the change rate of mother–child interaction affected school adaptation of children was statistically nonsignificant ( t = 1.007, p = 0.314). In the group where maternal depression was mild or higher, only the paths by which the initial value of mother–child interaction affected EF difficulty ( t = −2.75, p = 0.032) and EF difficulty affected school adaptation ( t = −7.876, p &lt; 0.001) were statistically significant. Conclusions This study confirms the research models developed by dividing mother–child interaction into two groups according to depression levels (i.e., normal range and mild or higher-level depression). The findings provide a basis for construction of individualized interventions.",40

Research on the sequelae of disaster exposure for children has focused largely on aspects that contribute to increased distress or risk for disorder; fewer studies have investigated influences that may serve a positive function. This study sought to address that gap by examining the association between key children's socioemotional resources reflecting the self-system (perceived competence, future expectations, coping competency beliefs) and postdisaster symptomatology (PTSS, depressive symptoms) at approximately 12 and 22 months posthurricane. Participants included 66 caregiver-child dyads at Time 1 (T1) and 51 at Time 2 (T2), recruited in Louisiana and Mississippi. Study results indicate that higher levels of child self-system resources and self-views were associated with lower symptom levels. Although results were mixed across time points, the study's key findings were: (a) children's T1 levels of coping competency beliefs predicted lower PTSS at T2; and (b) children's positive future expectations at T1 predicted lower levels of depressive symptoms at T2. Results support the value of incorporating child socioemotional resource variables in disaster research and building on children's self-system resources via intervention pre- and postdisaster.

Participants: A total of 168 individuals with mild to severe TBI and 105 of their close others. Main Outcomes Measures: Awareness Questionnaire (AQ) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Design: Cross-sectional study. Results: There were no significant differences in awareness as a function of time postinjury, except for the AQ motor/sensory domain wherein individuals with TBI at longer time periods displayed increased awareness of deficits than those at earlier time periods. Greater patient-other AQ discrepancy scores (interpreted as lower patient awareness) were associated with longer posttraumatic amnesia duration in the individual with TBI and also with increased self-reported depressive symptoms in the close others. Conversely, smaller AQ discrepancy scores (interpreted as better awareness) were associated with increased self-reported depressive symptoms by the individuals with TBI. Conclusion: This study highlights the limitations of using discrepancy scores to measure awareness, as ratings of injury-related changes are influenced by the mood of the individual with TBI and the close other, as well as by injury severity.",40

Cortical complexity, as measured by analyzing Fractal Dimension (FD) from T1 MRI brain images, has been reported to be reduced in a variety of psychiatric and neurological conditions. In this report, we hypothesized that FD would be also reduced in a case-control sample of 99 WTC responders as a result of WTC-related PTSD. The results of our surface-based morphometry cluster analysis found alterations in vertex clusters of complexity in WTC responders with PTSD, with marked reductions in regions within the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, in addition to whole-brain absolute bilateral and unilateral complexity. Furthermore, region of interest analysis identified that the magnitude of changes in regional FD severity was associated with increased PTSD symptoms (reexperiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, negative affect) severity. This study confirms prior findings on FD and psychiatric disorders and extends our understanding of FD associations with posttraumatic symptom severity. The complex and traumatic experiences that led to WTC-related PTSD were associated with reductions in cortical complexity. Future work is needed to determine whether reduced cortical complexity arose prior to, or concurrently with, onset of PTSD.",40

Our primary aim was to evaluate changes in PTSD symptom severity and alcohol misuse as a function of baseline hazardous drinking and treatment format (i.e., group or individual). At baseline and posttreatment, PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Symptom Scale–Interview Version and PTSD Checklist for DSM‐5 . Hazardous drinking was categorically defined as an Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test total score of 8 or higher. Employing intent‐to‐treat, mixed‐effects regression analysis, all groups reported reduced PTSD symptom severity, Hedges’ g s = −0.33 to −1.01, except, unexpectedly, nonhazardous drinkers who were randomized to group CPT, Hedges’ g = −0.12. Hazardous drinkers who were randomized to individual therapy had larger reductions in PTSD symptoms than nonhazardous drinkers who were randomized to group CPT, Hedges’ g = −0.25. Hazardous drinkers also reported significant reductions in alcohol misuse, regardless of treatment format, Hedges’ g s = −0.78 to −0.86. This study builds upon an emerging literature suggesting that individuals with PTSD and co‐occurring alcohol use disorder can engage successfully in CPT, which appears to be an appropriate treatment for these individuals whether it is delivered individually or in a group format. However, as a portion of participants remained classified as hazardous drinkers at posttreatment, some individuals may benefit from integrated treatment.",40

Today, Palestinians are the largest refugee population in the world after the Nakba in 1948. This study aims to discover the impact of chronic war traumas on PTSD diagnosis and symptoms from 2006 to 2021. The current study is a follow-up of 607 adolescents and adults, aged between 10–30 years of which are also those children who participated in the 2006 study. This research used an adapted PTSD scale (PTSD-SRII, 33 items) from a validated original questionnaire developed by Altawil in 2008 to measure PTSD based on symptoms reported in DSM-IV and ICD-10. Results The main findings show at least 97.2% of participants had experienced at least 6 traumatic experiences up to the year 2006 and 100% of the participants were exposed to traumas in 2021. This study found four categories of responses to chronic war trauma: (a) Acute group ( n = 321, 52.9%) shows high PTSD symptoms in 2006 and in 2021; (b) Remitters group ( n = 54, 8.9%) shows high PTSD symptoms in 2006 but did not show significant PTSD symptoms in 2021; (c) Delayed group ( n = 204, 33.6%) shows no PTSD symptoms in 2006 but showed significant PTSD symptoms in 2021; (d) Resilient group ( n = 28, 4.6%) had no PTSD symptoms in 2006 and did not show PTSD symptoms in 2021. Conclusions The authors conclude that Palestinian children, youth, adults and their families in the Gaza Strip are continually at a huge risk of developing PTSD and other psychological problems. This means that Palestinians will suffer for a long time from PTSD, which should be called Chronic Traumatic Stress Disorder (CTSD) rather than PTSD. This PTSD or CTSD cannot be changed unless the root of the problem is solved by ending the 74 years of living under occupation.",40

Less is known among the general population. We sought to determine the impact of PTSD on body mass index (BMI) and weight change among individuals with exposure to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster. Methods We examined individuals from the WTC Health Registry. PTSD symptoms were assessed on multiple surveys (Waves 1–4) using the PTSD Checklist-Specific. Three categories of post-9/11 PTSD were derived: no, intermittent, and persistent. We examined two outcomes: (1) Wave 3 BMI (normal, overweight, and obese) and (2) weight change between Waves 3 and 4. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between PTSD and BMI ( N = 34 958) and generalized estimating equations to assess the impact of PTSD on weight change ( N = 26 532). Sex- and age-stratified analyses were adjusted for a priori confounders. Results At Wave 3, the observed prevalence of obesity was highest among the persistent (39.5%) and intermittent PTSD (36.6%) groups, compared to the no PTSD group (29.3%). In adjusted models, persistent and intermittent PTSD were consistently associated with a higher odds of obesity. Weight gain was similar across all groups, but those with persistent and intermittent PTSD had higher estimated group-specific mean weights across time. Conclusions Our findings that those with a history of PTSD post-9/11 were more likely to have obesity is consistent with existing literature. These findings reaffirm the need for an interdisciplinary focus on physical and mental health to improve health outcomes.",40

We retrospectively investigated the role of peritraumatic dissociation (PD) in the occurrence of severe psychopathology and dissociative patterns of reactions in borderline personality disorder (BPD). We recruited 28 patients with a clinical diagnosis of BPD and 15 healthy controls. The BPD group was divided according to the level of PD (low vs. high): BPD and PD ( n = 15) and BPD only ( n = 13). We conducted an extensive investigation of history of trauma, clinical status, and measurements of emotional and physiologic responses to recall of personalized aversive experiences. Participants with BPD and high PD displayed highest degrees of trauma exposure and clinical symptoms. Their significant heart rate decline during the imagery of personal traumatic events was opposed to the heart rate increases exhibited by the other two groups and may indicate a dissociative reaction pattern. Skin conductance responses did not differentiate between groups. Several emotional responses to imagery also reinforced the idea that PD may play a role in memory processing of traumatic events and thus in the aggravation and maintenance of symptoms in particularly severe forms of BPD. Within a stepwise linear regression analysis, the best model for trauma‐evoked heart rate responses included PD and borderline symptoms, but no measures of state or trait dissociation. Our findings may provide initial evidence of an evolutionary model of peritraumatic reaction stages evolving from arousal to dissociation.",41

Although many families report high amounts of distress soon after injury, most are resilient and do not continue to experience prolonged psychosocial problems. The aim was to identify factors associated with parent resilience after pediatric burn injury.Fifty-seven parents of young children (< 5 years old) enrolled in a longitudinal assessment study. Baseline evaluations were conducted within 1 week of injury and included a medical chart review and parent self-report measures of resilience, social support, family functioning, and coping. Follow-up measurement of parent traumatic stress was measured 3 months after injury. We examined baseline resilience, positive emotionality, social support, family functioning, and problem-solving coping behaviors for relationships to traumatic stress.Parent resilience at baseline was associated with lower rates of parent traumatic stress symptoms at follow-up. Lower rates of traumatic stress were more common in parents of older children with more trait-level resilience, more social support, and more planning problem-solving behaviors at baseline.Baseline resilience characteristics are associated with less traumatic stress for parents several months after the injury. Findings can be used to develop screening strategies and interventions that address planning and problem-solving and emphasize social support.

Reactive aggression--an aggressive reaction to a perceived threat--has been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In contrast, appetitive aggression--a hedonic, intrinsically motivated form of aggression--seems to be negatively related to PTSD in offender and military populations. This study examined the associations between exposure to violence, trauma-related symptoms and aggression in a civilian population. In semistructured interviews, 290 Congolese refugees were questioned about trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and aggression. War-related trauma exposure correlated positively with exposure to family and community violence in the past month (r = .31, p < .001), and appetitive (r = .18, p = .002) and reactive aggression (r = .29, p < .001). The relationship between war-related trauma exposure and reactive aggressive behavior was mediated by PTSD symptoms and appetitive aggression. In a multiple sequential regression analysis, trauma exposure (β = .43, p < .001) and reactive aggression (β = .36, p < .001) were positively associated with PTSD symptoms, whereas appetitive aggression was negatively associated (β = -.13, p = .007) with PTSD symptoms. Our findings were congruent with the cycle of violence hypothesis and indicate a differential relation between distinct subtypes of aggression and PTSD.",41

Exposure to traumatic events and the associated risk of developing Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms is a significant and overlooked concern in the college population. It is important for current research to identify potential protective factors associated with the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms unique to this population. Emotional intelligence and perceived social support are two identified protective factors that influence the association between exposure to traumatic events and PTSD symptomology. The current study examined the mediating role of social support in the relationship between emotional intelligence and PTSD symptoms. Participants included 443 trauma-exposed university students who completed online questionnaires. The results of this study indicated that social support mediates the relationship between emotional intelligence and reported PTSD symptoms. Thus, emotional intelligence is significantly associated with PTSD symptoms and social support may play an integral role in the relationship between emotional intelligence and PTSD. The current study is the first to investigate the role of social support in the relationship between emotional intelligence and PTSD symptoms. These findings have important treatment and prevention implications with regard to PTSD.",41

The present exploratory study utilises a longitudinal cohort of 1230 U.S. veterans surveyed from February 2020 through February 2021. We sought to understand heterogeneity in perceived stress, using growth mixture modelling, over this time period, how COVID-specific factors such as negative reactions to the pandemic, loneliness, and employment disruptions influence perceived stress trajectories, and how veterans vary across distal outcomes including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), pain, depression, sleep problems, physical health, and alcohol use disorder. Results revealed a 4-class solution: Stable High, Stable Low, Steady Increasing, and Steady Decreasing classes. In terms of COVID specific factors, negative reactions to COVID were consistently associated with perceived stress for those in the Stable High and Steady Increasing classes whereas loneliness was associated with stress trajectories for all emergent classes. Finally, in terms of our distal outcomes, results showed a relatively robust pattern with veterans in the Stable High or Steady Increasing classes reporting worse scores across all outcomes including PTSD, pain, sleep problems, physical health, depression, and alcohol use disorder. Understanding the interplay between existing vulnerabilities, ongoing stressors, and behavioural health outcomes among veterans is crucial for prevention and intervention efforts.",41

Previous studies examining posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) trajectories have overlooked the co-existence of PTSD and PTG, making it difficult to accurately distinguish individuals with various posttraumatic presentations, causing the effects of targeted interventions to be discounted. To fill this gap, the current study sought to examine joint PTSD and PTG trajectories in children and adolescents. Eight hundred and seventy-six Chinese children and adolescents were recruited to complete self-report questionnaires 6, 12, and 18 months after the Ya'an earthquake. Multiple-process growth mixture modeling analysis was used to test the study proposal. Five distinct joint PTSD and PTG trajectory types were found: recovery, growth, struggling, resistant, and delayed symptoms. Female students and students who felt trapped or fearful were more likely to be in the struggling group, and students who experienced injury to themselves or family members were more likely to belong to the delayed symptom group. These findings suggest that postdisaster psychological services should be provided to relieve delayed symptoms in individuals who experience injury to themselves or their family members, and individuals in the struggling group should be supported to achieve growth.",41

However, there is little UK research regarding mental health or alcohol consumption among this population. Objective: This study examined mental health outcomes (probable depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) and alcohol consumption among UK military spouses/partners compared to women in the general population. Associations with military and socio-demographic characteristics were examined. Method: Survey data from 405 female spouses/partners of current and former UK Service personnel participating in a study of military-connected children (2010-2012) was analysed. Comparisons to women in the general population were made using the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (n = 1594). Results: Compared to women from the general population, military spouses/partners were significantly more likely to meet criteria for probable depression (adj. OR 2.50 (95% CI 1.52-4.11)). There was no significant difference regarding probable PTSD. Spouses/partners were significantly more likely to meet criteria for hazardous alcohol consumption (adj. OR 2.55 (95% CI 1.87-3.47)) and more likely to report episodes of weekly, daily or almost daily binge-drinking (adj. OR 2.15 (95% CI 1.28-3.61)) than women in the general population. Binge-drinking was significantly higher among spouses/partners of Service personnel reporting family separations of more than 2 months in the last 2 years compared to those reporting no, or shorter, separations (adj. OR 1.88 (95% CI 1.08-3.27)). Conclusion: This is the first study to examine mental health and alcohol consumption among UK military spouses/partners. The significantly higher prevalence of probable depression, hazardous alcohol consumption, and binge-drinking compared to women in the general population suggests further research is needed into the drivers of poor mental health and alcohol consumption among this population and in identifying or developing prevention campaigns to reduce alcohol use and support their well-being.Antecedentes: las familias de militares pueden experimentar factores estresantes únicos que pueden contribuir a un peor bienestar entre las esposas/parejas del personal del Servicio. Sin embargo, hay poca investigación en el Reino Unido sobre salud mental o consumo de alcohol en esta población.Objetivo: Este estudio examinó los resultados de salud mental (depresión probable y trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT)) y el consumo de alcohol entre las esposas/parejas de militares del Reino Unido en comparación con las mujeres de la población general. Se examinaron las asociaciones con características militares y sociodemográficas.Método: Se analizaron los datos de la encuesta de 405 esposas/parejas del personal actual y anterior del Servicio del Reino Unido que participaron en un estudio de niños vinculados al ejército (2010-2012). Las comparaciones con las mujeres en la población general se realizaron mediante la Encuesta de morbilidad psiquiátrica de adultos de 2007 (N = 1594).Resultados: en comparación con las mujeres de la población general, las esposas/parejas de militares tenían significativamente más probabilidades de cumplir con los criterios de depresión probable (adj. OR 2.50 (IC 95% 1.52-4.11)). No hubo diferencias significativas con respecto al TEPT probable. Las esposas/parejas tenían muchas más probabilidades de cumplir con los criterios para el consumo de alcohol peligroso (adj. OR 2.55 (IC 95% 1.87-3.47)) y tenían más probabilidades de reportar episodios de consumo excesivo de alcohol semanal, diario o casi diario (adj. OR 2.15 (IC 95% 1.28-3.61)) que las mujeres en la población general. El consumo excesivo de alcohol fue significativamente mayor entre las esposas/parejas del personal del Servicio que informaron separaciones familiares de más de 2 meses en los últimos 2 años en comparación con las que informaron que no hubo separaciones, o más cortas (adj.

We used two waves of data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES), an ongoing population-based, prospective cohort study in Japan. A unique feature of our study was the availability of information about mental health status pre-dating the disaster. Our sample comprised community-dwelling survivors aged 65 and older, who responded to surveys in 2010 (i.e. one year before the disaster) and in 2013 (n = 3464). We categorized disaster exposure according to three types of experiences: loss of family/friends, property damage, and disruption in access to medical service. Our main outcome was change in depressive symptoms, measured by the 15-item geriatric depression scale (GDS). Among the participants, 917 (26.5%) reported losing a family member to the disaster, while a further 537 (15.5%) reported losing a friend. More than half of the participants reported some damage to their homes. After adjusting for demographics and baseline mental health, people whose homes were completely destroyed had significantly elevated depressive symptom scores three years later (+1.22 points, 95%CI: 0.80, 1.64, p < 0.0001). Disruption of psychiatric care was also associated with change in GDS scores (+2.51 points, 95%CI: 1.28, 3.74, p < 0.0001). By contrast, loss of family/friends was no longer associated with GDS after 3 years; +0.18 points (95%CI: -0.018, 0.37, p = 0.08) for loss of family, and -0.045 points (95%CI: -0.28, 0.19, p = 0.71) for loss of friends. Three years after the disaster, survivors of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami appeared to have recovered from loss of loved ones. By contrast, property loss and disruption of psychiatry care were associated with persistent adverse impact on mental health.",41

Results show that personnel who screened positive for PTSD were more likely to screen positive for AUD (versus those who did not screen positive for PTSD). Perceived stress, neuroticism, and psychotherapy stigma all have direct multivariate relationships with PTSD symptoms. Moderated regression analyses show that the positive relationship between perceived stress and PTSD symptoms is significantly stronger among those scoring high on neuroticism and psychotherapy stigma. The positive relationship between perceived stress and AUD symptoms is only significant among those scoring high on psychotherapy stigma. Given the moderating role of psychotherapy stigma in the relationship between perceived stress and PTSD symptoms and the relationship between perceived stress and AUD symptoms efforts to reduce the stigma associated with mental health care in the military should be expanded. Also, the current research adds to the literature highlighting the role of neuroticism as a key variable in understanding PTSD.",42

We also explored and identified relevant factors associated with these metrics. We collected data regarding the sociodemographic and injury characteristics of 69 caregivers and their survivors. Their responses were recorded to the Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS), Impact of Events Scale for Burn (IESB), and Short Form-36 questionnaires. Temporal changes in the CBS, IESB, and SF-36 scores and their differences were analyzed using the generalized estimating equation. Among the caregivers of children, QoL decreased with increasing children's total burn surface area (TBSA) and length of hospital stays, caregivers being female, decreasing caregivers' age, increasing the time required to travel to and from the hospital, and increasing global and subjective burdens. Among the caregivers of adults, QoL decreased with increasing survivors' TBSA and caregivers' PTSD. Based on these results, several recommendations for implementation in clinical practice include integrating caregivers into care plans and encouraging active participation, providing learning and consultation channels, and encouraging caregivers to schedule breaks from caregiving activities.",42

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore the relation between psychopathology symptoms, namely, posttraumatic stress disorder), anxiety and depression, as well as post traumatic growth in parents following their child's hospitalisation in a paediatric intensive care unit.Six months after their child's discharge, 143 parents completed the questionnaire, which assessed post traumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory), post traumatic stress disorder (Davidson Trauma Scale), depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).Of the 143 parents, 23.1% reported symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder, 21% reported symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety, 9.1% reported symptoms of moderate to severe depression and 37.1% reported at least a medium degree of post traumatic growth. There was a moderate, direct association between post traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety with post traumatic growth. Higher scores in anxiety, depression and post traumatic stress disorder were associated with higher levels of post traumatic growth, contradicting the notion of an inverted U-shaped relationship between psychopathology symptoms and post traumatic growth.Given that positive and negative outcomes after a child's critical admission tend to co-occur, it is surmised that parents who indicate post traumatic growth do not deny the difficulties. While not negating the negative impact on the mental health of a parent with a child admitted to intensive care, including the assessment of post traumatic growth as an outcome following this event has important implications for research and clinical practice.",42

Follow up assessments occurred at 1 week, 6 months, 1 year, and 4 years. Hierarchical linear growth modeling (HLGM) was used to explore the association of parent-reported ADHD symptoms, the 2 treatment conditions (i.e., OST vs. EST), and the trajectory of change in the severity of the SP from pretreatment to the 4-year follow-up. Age, conduct problems and learning problems were controlled for in all analyses.A greater immediate reduction in severity rating of the SP was observed in the OST compared to EST, whereas the trajectory of long-term outcomes was similar across conditions over time. Higher levels of ADHD symptoms predicted poor immediate and long-term treatment outcomes across treatment conditions. ADHD symptoms, however, did not moderate the relationship between treatment condition and immediate or long-term treatment outcomes.The results of the study need to be interpreted in light of several study limitations. However, if confirmed, the findings suggest that anxious youth with comorbid ADHD symptoms are less likely to benefit from brief, intensive psychotherapy and may require either longer, standard CBT treatment or adjunctive pharmacotherapy.",42

The defense cascade model posits that individuals respond to stressors by progressing through a series of defensive reactions, with nonresponders having advanced to a shutdown response. It remains unclear whether dissociation is at the end of a continuum of passive behavior, indicating full shutdown, or if it comprises a distinct response. The present study aimed to address this uncertainty, using EFA to compare a two-factor (active, passive) and three-factor (active, passive, dissociative) model of defensive responding. Eighty-nine female physical and sexual assault survivors reported their peritraumatic reactions within 1 month of their assault, which were entered into the EFA. The three-factor model was superior, suggesting dissociation is a distinct category of peritraumatic coping. Peritraumatic use of both passive and dissociative coping strategies were each significantly associated with ongoing use of passive coping and increased PTSD symptoms 1-month posttrauma; surprisingly, the use of passive peritraumatic coping strategies was a better indicator than peritraumatic dissociation. The inclusion of depression as a covariate removed the association of passive (but not dissociative) coping with PTSD symptom severity. Active coping use was not significantly associated with any outcome, suggesting that the presence of shutdown responses is more informative than the presence or absence of any active coping. These findings highlight the importance of differentiating peritraumatic coping responses and the need for increased attention to the comparatively neglected topic of passive coping.",42

Few longitudinal studies have quantified this relationship so the evidence is limited regarding the potential benefit PTG may have on post-traumatic adjustment and whether differences between ethnic groups exist. Methods The current study attempts to fill a substantial gap in the literature by exploring the relationship between PTG and PTSD symptom clusters longitudinally using a nationally representative cohort of 1613 Israelis and Palestinian Citizens of Israel (PCI) interviewed via telephone on three measurement occasions during one year. Latent cross-lagged structural models estimated the relationship between PTG and each PTSD symptom cluster, derived from confirmatory factor analysis, representing latent and statistically invariant PTSD symptom factors, best representing PTSD for both ethnic groups. Results PTG was not associated with less PTSD symptom severity in any of the four PTSD clusters, for Jews and PCI. In contrast, PTSD symptom severity assessed earlier was related to later reported PTG in both groups. Conclusions This study demonstrates that PTSD symptoms contribute to greater reported PTG, but that PTG does not provide a salutatory benefit by reducing symptoms of PTSD.",42

The purpose of this qualitative study was threefold; first, to explore the relationship between PTSD and lower respiratory symptoms (LRS); second, to identify factors influencing self-management and treatment of both disorders; and third, to determine the impact of these comorbidities on quality of life. The goal was to identify strategies to improve coordination of medical and mental health management in order to reduce the symptomatic burden of these two health conditions. In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among 34 World Trade Center Health Registry (WTCHR) rescue/recovery workers and community members with both active LRS (self-reported history of cough, wheeze or shortness of breath) and report of PTSD diagnosis on their 2015–2016 survey. Thematic analysis identified 14 themes grouped into six main categories: relationship between LRS and PTSD, impact of symptoms on quality of life, medical management, symptom management strategies, current health status, and exposure history and symptoms. Participants spoke of a wide range of both symptom triggers and management strategies, including self-management and some maladaptive management behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption. Participants also spoke of feeling like there were gaps in their healthcare, particularly for mental health. In addition, many spoke to a lack of coordinated care between physical and mental health. The majority of participants did not feel that there was a link between their PTSD and LRS, and among them a large portion also reported a lack of control over their symptoms. Proactive and collaborative planning steps at multiple levels (healthcare, public health, disaster management) are needed to prevent adverse impacts of disasters. Because of the increasing trend in disasters (both natural and man-made), with potentially wide-ranging exposures, it is important to plan for the complex treatment of PTSD and other co-morbidities.",42
https://openalex.org/W3015437323,10.1371/journal.pone.0231709,Trajectories of fatigue among stroke patients from the acute phase to 18 months post-injury: A latent class analysis,"Introduction Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is a common symptom affecting 23–75% of stroke survivors. It is associated with increased risk of institutionalization and death, and it is of many patients considered among the worst symptoms to cope with after stroke. Longitudinal studies focusing on trajectories of fatigue may contribute to understanding patients’ experience of fatigue over time and its associated factors, yet only a few have been conducted to date. Objectives To explore whether subgroups of stroke survivors with distinct trajectories of fatigue in the first 18 months post stroke could be identified and whether these subgroups differ regarding sociodemographic, medical and/or symptom-related characteristics. Materials and methods 115 patients with first-ever stroke admitted to Oslo University Hospital or Buskerud Hospital were recruited and data was collected prospectively during the acute phase and at 6, 12 and 18 months post stroke. Data on fatigue (both pre- and post-stroke), sociodemographic, medical and symptom-related characteristics were collected through structured interviews, standardized questionnaires and from the patients’ medical records. Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to identify latent classes, i.e., subgroups of patients, based on their Fatigue Severity Scales (FSS) scores at the four time points. Differences in sociodemographic, medical, and symptom-related characteristics between the latent classes were evaluated using univariate and multivariable ordinal regression analyses. Results and their significance Using GMM, three latent classes of fatigue trajectories over 18 months were identified, characterized by differing levels of fatigue: low, moderate and high. The mean FSS score for each class remained relatively stable across all four time points. In the univariate analyses, age <75, pre-stroke fatigue, multiple comorbidities, current depression, disturbed sleep and some ADL impairment were associated with higher fatigue trajectories. In the multivariable analyses, pre-stroke fatigue (OR 4.92, 95% CI 1.84–13.2), multiple comorbidities (OR 4,52,95% CI 1.85–11.1) and not working (OR 4.61, 95% CI 1.36–15,7) were the strongest predictor of higher fatigue trajectories The findings of this study may be helpful for clinicians in identifying patients at risk of developing chronic fatigue after stroke.",42

However, the contribution of childhood adversities and environmental sensitivity to children's responses to adversities and trauma are still far from settled. Aims To evaluate the relative roles of war, childhood adversities and sensitivity in the genesis of PTSD. Method Data on childhood adversities and sensitivity was collected from 549 Syrian refugee children in Lebanon. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PTSD Reaction Index. Results Although childhood adversities, war events and sensitivity were all significantly related to PTSD in bivariate analyses, multivariate analyses showed that childhood adversities were the most important variable in predicting PTSD. The effect of war on PTSD was found to be dependent on the interplay between childhood adversities and sensitivity, and was most prominent in highly sensitive children with lower levels of adversities; in sensitive children experiencing high levels of adversities, the effects of war exposure on PTSD were less pronounced. Conclusions When considering the effects of war on PTSD in refugee children, it is important to take account of the presence of other adversities as well as of children's sensitivity. Sensitive children may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of war exposure, but only in contexts that are characterised by low childhood adversities. Declaration of interest None.",42

However, it is yet unclear what longitudinal patterns of posttraumatic symptom levels may predict the development of PTG. Methods World Trade Center (WTC) rescue and recovery workers (2038 police and 2103 non-traditional responders) were assessed an average of 3, 6, 8, and 12 years post-9/11/2001. Responders’ WTC-related PTSD symptoms were characterized by No/Low Symptom, Worsening/Subtly Worsening, Steeply Worsening (only for non-traditional responders), Improving, and Chronic trajectories. PTSD symptom trajectories were examined as predictors of PTG, which was assessed using total scores on the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory-Short Form. Results Across both occupational groups, being female, older, Hispanic, and experiencing more post-9/11 traumatic events were independently associated with self-reported PTG. Among police responders, a greater number of WTC exposures and supportive family members while working at the WTC site were linked to higher PTG. Among non-traditional responders, Black race/ethnicity, less education, fewer pre-9/11 traumatic events, and the presence of support while working at the WTC site were additionally linked to higher PTG. Only the moderate PTSD symptom trajectories (ie, worsening and improving) for police responders and all symptomatic trajectories for non-traditional responders were associated with higher levels of PTG. Conclusions Symptomatic 12-year trajectories of PTSD symptoms and certain sociodemographic characteristics, stressor exposures, and supportive resources were associated with PTG in traditional and non-traditional WTC responders. Results provide insight into subgroups of WTC responders who may benefit from PTG-promoting interventions, as well as potentially modifiable targets to help foster PTG in this population.",42

The PTSD Check list-Civilian Version (PCL-C) was used at all time points. Growth mixture models (GMM) were estimated to examine whether individuals could be clustered into discrete groups with similar trajectories. Multinomial logistic regressions were carried out to investigate factors associated with class membership. The three-class GMM was the most parsimonious solution. This included 90.2% in the resilient class, 4.1% in the improving class and 5.7% in the deteriorating class. Both the deteriorating and improving classes were associated with childhood adversity (odds ratios (OR) 3.9 (95% CI 2.3, 6.7) and 3.3 (95% CI 2.1, 5.0) respectively) and antisocial behaviour (OR 2.8 (95% CI 1.9, 4.2) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.4, 5.8) respectively), alcohol misuse (OR 3.5 (95% CI 2.4, 5.1) and 3.3 (95% CI 2.1, 5.2) respectively) and longer time since leaving Service in comparison to the resilient group. Those in the youngest group and those in a combat role (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19, 0.54) were more likely to belong to the deteriorating class. 10% of the cohort had symptoms of PTSD; of those, up to half were symptomatic for most of the follow-up period. Those whose score improved did not reach the low scores of the resilient group. Younger age and combat role were associated with worse prognosis of PTSD.",43

To date, the relationship between children's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and their parents' mental health outcomes have been understudied, and specifically, long term STS symptoms of parents of war veterans were not investigated. The current study examined PTSD symptoms among veterans of the 2014 Israel-Gaza war and STS among their parents, five years after the war. The control group consisted of veterans from combat military units who were on active duty at the time of the war but did not actively participate in the war (stand-by units) - providing a natural experiment condition. We found that PTSD symptoms were almost twice as high in the directly active war veterans (DAV, N = 32) group compared to the indirectly active war veterans (IAV, N = 26) group. Results showed that mothers had higher STS symptoms in general, and DAV PTSD symptoms correlated with their fathers STS symptoms. The current study provides novel evidence for: (a) subclinical PTSD symptoms in war veterans 5 years after the war, and (b) transmission of trauma from war veterans to their parents. The overall negative effect of sending a child to war on the parents are also discussed.The current study examined post-traumatic stress symptoms among undiagnosed war veterans of the 2014–2014 Israel-Gaza Military Conflict compared to matched control who were on active military duty at the same time but did not actively participate in the war. We found higher post-traumatic stress symptoms in the veterans who actively participated in the war, roughly five years after the war.Parents of veterans who actively participated in the war exhibited higher secondary traumatic stress compared to parents of veterans who did not actively participate in the war. This is especially interesting given that parents of all veterans were not aware of their whereabouts during the war. Overall, mothers exhibited higher secondary traumatic stress compared to fathers. However, fathers were more ‘in-sync’ with their sons’ traumatic experience as evident by a significant correlation between the war veterans’ post-traumatic stress and the fathers’ secondary traumatic stress symptoms.",43
https://openalex.org/W2586086956,,Burnout and Social Connectedness: Predictors of PTSD and Well-Being in the Police,"In their day-to-day tasks, police officers are repeatedly subjected to stressful and traumatic events and as such are at significant risk of developing post - traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is a wealth of literature exploring risk and protective factors, however there is still a need to develop our understanding of specific factors which may be unique to the police. In light of this need, two potential factors have been identified for this current research, burnout and social connectedness. Burnout relates to a culmination of stress which is unmanaged and untreated. Social connectedness relates to the internal experience of feeling connected to others and the world around. 
This thesis is primarily concerned with exploring the relationship between these factors and PTSD and general distress within the context of the police force. This research took place within one UK police force. In total, 93 participants from specialist departments at high risk of exposure to trauma took part in an online survey. The survey included self-report measures of burnout, social connectedness, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and general distress. Non-standardised measures also sought to capture demographic information and an additional outcome variable of sickness absence. 

A series of multiple forced-entry regressions were carried out. Increased symptoms of exhaustion (one aspect of burnout), significantly predicted increased PTSD symptom severity. Further exploratory analyses found that exhaustion significantly predicted two of the four PTSD symptom clusters: intrusion and alterations in arousal and reactivity. The same multiple regression analysis indicated that social connectedness made a significant contribution to the model predicting PTSD symptom severity, greater than that of exhaustion. It was also found that increased symptoms of exhaustion significantly predicted increased general distress, whereas disengagement (a further aspect of burnout) and social connectedness did not. Lastly, it was found that none of the predictor variables made a significant contribution to the model predicting sickness absence. These findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical and clinical implications.",43

To explore predictors of a chronic and delayed trajectory of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) after a natural disaster, we analyzed psychometric data collected from 412 residents of Christchurch, New Zealand after a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck in February 2011. Participants from suburbs with different levels of socioeconomic status (SES) and earthquake impact completed a door‐to‐door survey 4–7 months after the earthquake (Time 1; N = 600) and again 10–11 months after the earthquake (Time 2; N = 412). The survey included the Acute Stress Disorder Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire's nine‐item Depression subscale, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 scale, along with single‐item measures of variables including aftershock anxiety and family tension. Hobfoll's conservation of resources theory was used to guide data interpretation. High levels of depression, odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.24, and anxiety, OR = 1.24, at Time 1 significantly predicted membership in the chronic trajectory. Predictors of a delayed onset of symptoms included increased aftershock anxiety, OR = 1.29, and family tension, OR = 1.35, over time, as well as living in an area defined as being of low, OR = 5.36, or medium, OR = 11.39, SES. Results highlight risk factors for elevated PTSS and resources that individuals can use to offset threatened loss. These findings have implications for service providers, agencies, and the public.",43

To date, research regarding injustice perception and injury outcomes has been restricted to a small number of musculoskeletal pain conditions. No research to date has examined the potential impact of perceived injustice among individuals admitted for trauma care.As part of this cross-sectional study, individuals (n = 155) admitted to a Level-1 trauma center completed measures of perceived injustice, pain, depression, posttraumatic stress, and health related (physical and mental/emotional) quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes 12 months after trauma admission.Bivariate analyses revealed significant associations between perceived injustice and demographic variables (education, income, race, and age) as well as injury-related variables (type of injury and length of hospital stay). Perceived injustice was correlated with greater pain intensity, depression, and PTSD symptoms, as well as poorer physical and mental HRQoL. Controlling for relevant demographic and injury-related variables, perceived injustice accounted for unique variance in pain intensity, depression severity, the presence and intensity of PTSD symptoms, mental HRQoL, and was marginally significant for physical HRQoL.This is the first study to examine perceived injustice in a trauma sample. Results support the presence of injustice perception in this group and its associations with pain and quality of life outcomes. Additional research is suggested to explore the impact of perceived injustice on recovery outcomes among individuals who have sustained traumatic injury.",43

Method Longitudinal data of 539 participants with a current panic disorder were collected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Childhood trauma was assessed with a structured interview and clinical course after two years with a DSM-IV-based diagnostic interview and the Life Chart Interview. Results At baseline, 56.3% reported childhood trauma, but this was not predictive of persistence of panic disorder. Emotional neglect and psychological abuse were associated with higher occurrence of anxiety disorders other than panic disorder (social phobia) and with higher chronicity of general anxiety symptoms (anxiety attacks or episodes and avoidance). Baseline clinical features (duration and severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms) and personality traits (neuroticism and extraversion) accounted for roughly 30 to 60% of the total effect of childhood trauma on chronicity of anxiety symptoms and on occurrence of other anxiety disorders. Conclusion After two years, childhood trauma is associated with chronicity of anxiety symptoms and occurrence of social phobia, rather than persistence of panic disorder. These relationships are partially accounted for by duration and severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and neuroticism and extraversion.

The present study prospectively examined the prevalence and predictors of treatment use among college women following a campus shooting. Predictors included age, race/ethnicity, education level, severity of exposure to shooting, and post-shooting sequelae (i.e., social support, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] severity, depression severity). Present data were obtained from 516 women on campus at the time of the shooting. They completed electronic and online surveys across three time points - pre-shooting (T1), 1-month post-shooting (T2), and 6-months post-shooting (T3). As expected, few participants (14.4%) sought any treatment. Of note, 77.5% of participants endorsed at least one risk factor for PTSD. Prevalence rates of probable PTSD significantly decreased from 51.8% of the full sample at T2 to 12.9% at T3. Results showed that a significantly higher proportion of participants with probable PTSD at T3 sought treatment than those participants at minimal to no risk for PTSD. Psychotherapy was sought at higher rates than medication or combined treatment across risk groups. No reliable predictors of treatment use were observed for at-risk participants or those with probable PTSD. Research and clinical suggestions for optimizing post-disaster recovery and improving treatment utilization among students following campus shootings are discussed.",44
https://openalex.org/W4387599400,10.1111/epi.17797,Trajectories of parent well‐being in children with drug‐resistant epilepsy,"Abstract Objective This longitudinal cohort study aimed to identify trajectories of parent well‐being over the first 2 years after their child's evaluation for candidacy for epilepsy surgery, and to identify the baseline clinical and demographic characteristics associated with these trajectories. Parent well‐being was based on parent depressive and anxiety symptoms and family resources (i.e., family mastery and social support). Methods Parents of 259 children with drug‐resistant epilepsy (105 of whom eventually had surgery) were recruited from eight epilepsy centers across Canada at the time of their evaluation for epilepsy surgery candidacy. Participants were assessed at baseline and 6‐month, 1‐year, and 2‐year follow‐up. The trajectories of parents' depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and family resources were jointly estimated using multigroup latent class growth models. Results The analyses identified three trajectories: an optimal‐stable group with no/minimal depressive or anxiety symptoms, and high family resources that remained stable over time; a mild‐decreasing‐plateau group with mild depressive and anxiety symptoms that decreased over time then plateaued, and intermediate family resources that remained stable; and a moderate‐decreasing group with moderate depressive and anxiety symptoms that decreased slightly, and low family resources that remained stable over time. Parents of children with higher health‐related quality of life, fathers, and parents who had higher household income were more likely to have better trajectories of well‐being. Treatment type was not associated with the trajectory groups, but parents whose children were seizure‐free at the time of the last follow‐up were more likely to have better trajectories (optimal‐stable or mild‐decreasing‐plateau trajectories). Significance This study documented distinct trajectories of parent well‐being, from the time of the child's evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Parents who present with anxiety and depressive symptoms and low family resources do not do well over time. They should be identified and offered supportive services early in their child's epilepsy treatment history.",44

Current concepts are based on The Adaptations Level Theory, which describes the ability of resilient individuals to accustom to new and even downgraded conditions as the new standard, find meaning in trauma, and adapt to new social settings. However, it is not known which treatments specifically help to build up resilience in patients and how to reliably screen for it. We hypothesize that by analyzing mechanisms of behavior and physiology in resilient individuals, we will be able to strengthen these in people that are struggling to bounce back. Recent studies demonstrated that distinct patterns of language use correlated with various mental health conditions. Utilizing text samples from Holocaust survivors, we compared language use in resilient individuals to people with PTSD and the general population. The Holocaust survivors' language use was significantly different from PTSD sufferers, which suggests that we detected a possible resilience word use pattern. Next, we looked into the brain circuitry mechanisms that could be involved in resilience. We found that norepinephrine, the key neurotransmitter in stress response, modulated the activity of amygdala circuitry in a non-linear concentration-dependent manner. The shape and other characteristics of this dependency could be associated with the capacity for resilience.",44

https://openalex.org/W2981552319,10.1002/jts.22459,Typologies of Combat Exposure and Their Effects on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression Symptoms,"Abstract The present study identified distinct classes of U.S. military service members based on their combat experiences and examined mental health outcomes and longitudinal growth curves of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms associated with each class. Participants were 551 active duty service members who screened positive for PTSD and/or depression based on DSM‐IV‐TR criteria. All participants completed the Combat Experiences Scale at baseline as well as PTSD and depression measures at baseline and at 3‐, 6‐, and 12‐month follow‐ups. A latent class analysis identified four classes of service members based on their combat experiences: limited exposure, medical exposure, unit exposure, and personal exposure. Service members in the personal exposure class were characterized by a distinct mental health profile: They reported a higher level of PTSD symptoms at baseline and a higher prevalence of traumatic brain injury and PTSD diagnoses during the course of the study. The limited exposure class was more likely to receive diagnoses of depression and adjustment disorders. All classes except the medical exposure class demonstrated a slight decrease in PTSD and depression symptoms over time. However, participants in the limited exposure class had a larger decrease in PTSD and depression symptoms earlier in care but did not demonstrate superior long‐term symptom improvements at 12 months compared to the other groups. These results inform PTSD development models and have implications for the screening and clinical management of combat‐exposed service members.",44

However, there was considerable heterogeneity in outcomes across individuals. Factors such as older age, non-White race, lower preinjury productivity, public payer source, longer length of inpatient rehabilitation stay, and lower discharge functional status were found to negatively impact trajectories of change over time.These findings can inform the content, timing, and target recipients of interventions designed to maximize functional independence after TBI.",44

Compared with research on the risk factors of post-disaster post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), limited studies have reported protective factors against PTSD. We investigated whether resilience, social support, and trust in government were associated with PTSD in disaster survivors, after adjustment for the perceived damage and demographic variables including sex, age, and economic status. We investigated 2311 disaster survivors, using data from the ""Long-term survey on the change of life of Disaster victim"" performed by NDMI(National Disaster Management Research Institute). Hierarchical regression analysis was used in this study. A high level of trust in institutions was associated with few PTSD symptoms after adjustment for resilience and social support. Among the subfactors of institutional trust, psychological counseling and environmental and facility restoration were associated with PTSD. Psychological counseling and environmental and facility restoration support for disaster survivors were associated with reduced PTSD symptoms. Post-disaster policy support, including psychological counseling and environmental and facility restoration services, is important. Our findings highlight the protective factors against PTSD symptoms and may serve as guidelines for specific interventions for the management of post-disaster PTSD.",44

Approximately 18% of patients develop posttraumatic stress disorder in the aftermath of MI. Trait resilience has shown to be a protective factor for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder. However, whether this buffering effect has already an impact on peritraumatic distress and applies to patients with MI is elusive. Methods We investigated 98 consecutive patients with acute MI within 48 hours after having reached stable circulatory conditions and 3 months thereafter. Peritraumatic distress was assessed retrospectively with three single-item questions about pain, fear, and helplessness during MI. All patients completed the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) and the Resilience Scale to self-rate posttraumatic stress and trait resilience. Results Multivariate models adjusting for sociodemographic and medical factors showed that trait resilience was not associated with peritraumatic distress, but significantly so with posttraumatic stress. Patients with greater trait resilience showed lower PDS scores (b = −0.06, p < .001). There was no significant relationship between peritraumatic distress scores and PDS scores; resilience did not emerge as a moderator of this relationship. Conclusions The findings suggest that trait resilience does not buffer the perception of acute MI as stressful per se but may enhance better coping with the traumatic experience in the longer term, thus preventing the development of MI-associated posttraumatic stress. Trait resilience may play an important role in posttraumatic stress symptoms triggered by medical diseases such as acute MI.",44

The aim of this study was to determine whether latent class analysis, latent class growth analysis or growth mixture modeling was most appropriate for identifying developmental trajectory classes.We compared the three methods in a simulation study in several scenarios, which varied regarding e.g. sample size and degree of separation between classes. The simulation study was replicated with a real data example concerning anxiety/depression symptoms measured over 6 time points in the Tracking Adolescent Individuals' Lives Survey (TRAILS, N = 2227).Growth mixture modeling was least biased or equally biased compared to latent class analysis and latent class growth analysis in all scenarios. In TRAILS, the shapes of the trajectories were rather similar over the three methods, but class sizes differed slightly. A 4-class growth mixture model performed best, based on several fit indices, interpretability and clinical relevance.Growth mixture modeling seems most suitable to identify developmental trajectory classes.",44

Although these adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS) are often studied separately, clinical comorbidity is high. In a cohort of European American motor vehicle collision (MVC) trauma survivors ( n = 781), substantial PTS (≥33, IES-R), DS (≥26, CES-D), and MSP (≥4, 0–10 NRS) were identified via a 6-month survey. Genetic risk was estimated using polygenic risk scores (PRSs) calculated from the largest available GWAS datasets of PTSD, MDD, and back pain. We then assessed comorbidity and genetic risk influence for developing chronic PTS, DS, and MSP after MVC. Secondary analyses explored whether common social determinants of health ameliorate genetic vulnerability. We found that 6 months after MVC, nearly half 357/781 (46%) of the participants had substantial PTS, DS, and/or MSP, and overlap was common (PTS + MSP (23%), DS + MSP (18%), PTS + DS (12%)). Genetic risk predicted post-MVC outcomes. PTSD-PRSs predicted PTS and DS ( R 2 = 2.21% and 2.77%, p adj &lt; 0.01), MDD-PRSs predicted DS and MSP ( R 2 = 1.89%, p adj &lt; 0.01) and 0.79%, p adj &lt; 0.05), and back pain-PRS predicted MSP ( R 2 = 1.49%, p adj &lt; 0.01). Individuals in the highest quintile of PTSD-PRSs had 2.8 and 3.5 times the odds of developing PTS and DS vs. the lowest quintile (95% CI = 1.39–5.75 and 1.58–7.76). Among these high-risk individuals, those living in non-disadvantaged neighborhoods and with college education had 47% ( p = 0.048) and 52% ( p = 0.04) less risk of developing PTS, and those with high social support had 60% ( p = 0.008) less risk of developing DS. Overall, genetic factors influence the risk of APNS after MVC, genetic risk of distinct APNS are overlapping, and specific social determinants greatly augment genetic risk of APNS development after MVC.",44
https://openalex.org/W3194287567,,A Mental or Behavioural Post Traumatic Disorder,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be a mental and behavioral disorder which will develop due to exposure to a traumatic event, like sexual abuse, warfare, traffic collisions, maltreatment, violence or other threats on an individual's life.

https://openalex.org/W4382790738,10.1093/jbcr/irad045.139,542 Identifying Psychosocial Factors Impacting Burn Survivors,"Abstract Introduction Burn survivors often suffer from profound psychosocial stress. Following a traumatic burn, new stressors and mental health symptoms can arise, and previously existing factors can be amplified. Alleviation of these stressors can facilitate healing, treatment compliance, and favorable outcomes. We sought to better identify psychosocial factors that impact the lives of adult burn survivors. Our primary aim was to develop a psychosocial screening battery and brief screener to identify stressors common among such patients at our hospital-based outpatient burn center. Methods A survey was administered to adult burn survivors at a monthly support group. Participants were instructed to endorse items from a list of 39 possible stressors and symptoms that impacted them after their burn injury. The most frequently endorsed items were considered for inclusion in the screening tool. Results A total of 17 surveys were completed, nine (53%) of whom were men and eight (47%) of whom were women. Ages ranged from 18 to 79 years. The earliest burn injury occurred in 1990, and the most recent occurred in 2022. There were 17 survey items endorsed by 29% or more of the respondents (Table 1). Conclusions Numerous symptoms and stressors endorsed by participants align with mental health conditions like acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. We decided to implement the Primary Care PTSD Screen and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item within our outpatient clinic in addition to the depression screen already in use. Items not addressed by questions on these mental health screens were included in our brief burn survivor stress screening measure. Applicability of Research to Practice Implementation of this screening battery will enable identification of psychosocial factors impacting adult burn patients previously hospitalized as a result of their injuries. This will allow us to address patient concerns, offer recommendations for support and resources, and guide treatment planning to improve compliance and outcomes. In the future, this information will facilitate the development of additional programs to assist burn survivors.",45
https://openalex.org/W3210390348,10.1037/tra0001128,Treatment response and treatment response predictors of a multidisciplinary day clinic for police officers with PTSD.,"Police officers typically face multiple potentially traumatic events and consequently have a higher conditional probability of developing PTSD. Although most police officers with PTSD benefit from first-line treatment, it is unknown whether recommended intensification of treatment for low responders is effective and which factors contribute to response. This study aimed to examine the treatment response of a day clinic for police officers with PTSD and identify predictors of treatment response.Between 2009 and 2019, routine outcome monitoring measurements consisting of PTSD symptom severity and general psychological distress were administered at two timepoints among 102 patients undergoing a day clinic treatment consisting of trauma-focused therapy, sociotherapy, and psychomotor therapy. Hierarchical regression was used to assess whether change in PTSD symptom severity was associated with baseline PTSD and depression severity, gender, age, and eligibility for a recognition procedure.Significant improvements in PTSD symptom severity were found over the course of the treatment (d = .59), with 47% of patients showing statistically reliable improvement in their symptoms. The only significant predictor of treatment response was eligibility for a recognition procedure, with the total model explaining approximately 10% of the variation in treatment response.Intensifying treatment for police officers with PTSD who do not respond to previous trauma-focused treatment appears beneficial for a substantial number of patients. However, eligibility for a recognition procedure may negatively impact treatment response. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",45

Maternal data were elicited via the Earthquake Experience Questionnaire (EEQ), the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and the PTSD Checklist Specific (PCL-S). Child-related data were obtained from maternal completion of the Échelle d’Évaluation des Comportements Autistiques Révisée (ECAR) (Autistic Behaviors Scale Revised) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).Peritraumatic distress was significantly associated with maternal PTSD symptoms (r = .64, p = 0.01). Moreover, when maternal PTSD symptoms were added to final models of predictors for offspring autistic behaviors and pervasive developmental disorder, the amount of variance explained increased respectively from 14 to 21% and 15 to 23%.Exposure to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti during pregnancy may be a risk factor for maternal PTSD, which may be associated with the presence of ASD symptoms/behaviors in the offspring at age three.

We evaluated the validity of self-assessed resilience among U.S. Army soldiers, including whether predeployment perceived resilience predicted postdeployment emotional disorder. Methods Resilience was assessed via self-administered questionnaire among new soldiers reporting for basic training (N = 35,807) and experienced soldiers preparing to deploy to Afghanistan (N = 8,558). Concurrent validity of self-assessed resilience was evaluated among recruits by estimating its association with past-month emotional disorder. Predictive validity was examined among 3,526 experienced soldiers with no lifetime emotional disorder predeployment. Predictive models estimated associations of predeployment resilience with incidence of emotional disorder through 9 months postdeployment and with marked improvement in coping at 3 months postdeployment. Weights-adjusted regression models incorporated stringent controls for risk factors. Results Soldiers characterized themselves as very resilient on average [M = 14.34, SD = 4.20 (recruits); M = 14.75, SD = 4.31 (experienced soldiers); theoretical range = 0–20]. Demographic characteristics exhibited only modest associations with resilience, while severity of childhood maltreatment was negatively associated with resilience in both samples. Among recruits, resilience was inversely associated with past-month emotional disorder [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.62–0.68, P < .0005 (per standard score increase)]. Among deployed soldiers, greater predeployment resilience was associated with decreased incidence of emotional disorder (AOR = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.84–0.98; P = .016) and increased odds of improved coping (AOR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.24–1.49; P < .0005) postdeployment. Conclusions Findings supported validity of self-assessed resilience among soldiers, although its predictive effect on incidence of emotional disorder was modest. In conjunction with assessment of known risk factors, measurement of resilience could help predict adaptation to foreseen stressors like deployment.",45

Depressive symptomatology was assessed in years two through seven using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), with higher scores representing more severe depressive symptoms. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to determine latent classes of CES-D scores over time. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to identify baseline characteristics associated with worse classes of depressive symptoms.CES-D scores for 763 individuals with SLE over 6 years were mapped into four distinct classes. Class 1 (36%) and class 2 (32%) comprised the largest proportion of the cohort and were defined by the lowest and low CES-D scores (no depression), respectively. Class 3 (22%) and class 4 (10%) had high and the highest scores (depression), respectively. Greater age [odds ratio (OR): 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96, 0.99] and higher education level (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.89) at baseline were associated with lower odds of membership in worse classes of depressive symptoms. Conversely, lower income (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.92), worse SF-36 physical functioning scores (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.13) and worse SF-36 bodily pain scores (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.55, 1.61) were positively associated with membership in worse classes of depressive symptoms.Four classes of depressive symptoms were identified in patients with SLE.

https://openalex.org/W1540984113,10.1002/jts.21988,The Relationship Between Course of PTSD Symptoms in Deployed U.S. Marines and Degree of Combat Exposure,"Abstract Large cohort studies suggest that most military personnel experience minimal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following warzone deployment, an outcome often labeled resilience . Very low symptom levels, however, may be a marker for low exposure, not resilience, which requires relatively high‐magnitude or high‐frequency stress exposure as a precondition. We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to examine the longitudinal course of lifetime PTSD symptoms following combat exposure by disaggregating deployed U.S. Marines into upper, middle, and lower tertiles of combat exposure. All factor models fit the data well; Tucker‐Lewis Index (TLI) and comparative fit index (CFI) values ranged from .91 to .97. Three distinct trajectories best explained the data within each tertile. The upper tertile comprised True Resilience (73.2%), New‐Onset Symptoms (18.3%), and Pre‐existing Symptoms (8.5%) trajectories. The middle tertile also comprised True Resilience (74.5%), New‐Onset Symptoms (16.1%), and Pre‐existing Symptoms (9.4%) trajectories. The lower tertile comprised Artifactual Resilience (86.3%), Pre‐existing Symptoms (7.6%), and New‐Onset Symptoms (6.1%) trajectories. True Resilience involved a clinically significant symptom increase followed by a return to baseline, whereas Artifactual Resilience involved consistently low symptoms. Conflating artifactual and true resilience may inaccurately create the expectation of persistently low symptoms regardless of warzone exposure.",45

Growth mixture modeling assessed for trajectories of treatment response across pre-, mid-, and posttreatment and 1-year follow-up. Pretreatment client demographic and clinical traits and treatment modality (individual- and family-based CBT) were examined as predictors of trajectory classes.Growth mixture modeling supported three trajectory classes based on parent-reported symptoms: steady responders, rapid responders, and delayed improvement. A 4-class model was supported for youth-reported symptoms: steady responders, rapid responders, delayed improvement, and low-symptom responders. Delayed improvement classes were predicted by higher number of diagnoses (parent and youth report). Receiving family CBT predicted membership in the delayed improvement class compared to all other classes and membership in the steady responder class compared with rapid responders (youth report). Rapid responders were predicted by older age (parent report) and higher number of diagnoses (parent report). Low-symptom responders were more likely to be male (youth report).Integrative data analysis identified distinct patterns of symptom change. Diagnostic complexity, age, gender, and treatment modality differentiated response classes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",45

Method The population included 7875 rescue/recovery workers who completed a subjective cognition measure, the Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI), between 3/1/2018 and 2/28/2019 during routine monitoring, indicating whether they had experienced cognitive and functional difficulties in the past year. Higher scores indicated greater self‐perceived cognitive change. Probable PTSD, depression, and alcohol abuse were evaluated by validated mental health screeners. Logistic regression assessed the associations of WTC exposure and current PTSD with top‐quartile (≥2) CFI score, and of early post‐9/11 PTSD with top‐quartile CFI in a subpopulation ( N = 6440). Models included demographics, smoking, depression, and alcohol abuse as covariates. Results Mean age at CFI completion was 56.7 ± 7.7 (range: 36–81). Participants with high‐intensity WTC exposure had an increased likelihood of top‐quartile CFI score (odds ratio[OR] vs. low exposure: 1.32, 95%CI: 1.07–1.64), controlling for covariates. Current and early PTSD were both associated with top‐quartile CFI (OR: 3.25, 95%CI: 2.53–4.19 and OR: 1.56, 95%CI: 1.26–1.93) respectively. Conclusions High‐intensity WTC exposure was associated with self‐reported cognitive change 17 years later in rescue/recovery workers, as was PTSD.

Socio-demographic and injury severity data were recorded at baseline. Participants completed the Patient Competency Rating Scale (PCRS) at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine PCRS trajectories over time and assess baseline predictors.Results: There was no significant change in average PCRS scores across the follow-up time points in the full sample. Emotional and cognitive competencies had the lowest mean scores. Gender, employment, and the interaction term between gender and time were significant predictors of PCRS trajectories. Females and those who were unemployed at the time of injury showed lower trajectories of self-reported competency.Conclusion: Self-reported competency remained stable from one-year post-injury for men only. Lower mean scores in the domains of emotional and cognitive competencies suggest a need for continued rehabilitation focus in the chronic phase after TBI. Special attention to women and individuals who are unemployed at the time of injury may be warranted.",45

Relocation out of the region was determined by disaster-related property/financial losses and fear during the earthquake. Anticipatory fear of future earthquakes and less sense of control over life were the strongest predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms. Relocation within the disaster region predicted PTSD but not depression. Dissatisfaction with emotional support received from close ones was significantly associated with depression, but it was associated with PTSD at a marginally significant level. Survivors who experienced more intense fear during the earthquake displayed higher levels of anticipatory fear in the long term, whereas avoidance of trauma reminders and fear-evoking situations sustained anticipatory fear of future earthquakes. These findings suggest that interventions that reduce fear and avoidance behaviors would help survivors overcome traumatic stress and depressive symptoms.",45

Palestinian refugees live under challenging circumstances and have negative future prospects, so negative cognitions might be expected to prevail. It is uncertain whether findings on the relation between PTC and PTSD in other (non-refugee) populations can be generalized to the Palestinian refugee context. The first objective was to examine the degree to which endorsement of PTC in this sample differed from the endorsement observed in other samples. The second objective was to investigate whether PTC explain variance in PTSD symptomatology and are predictive of PTSD diagnostic status. In Palestinian refugees ( N = 85, 51.8% female), PTSD symptoms and negative cognitions were assessed. One sample t tests and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Total PTC scores were significantly higher in the Palestinian sample than in reference samples. Negative cognitions explained significant variance in PTSD symptoms and probable diagnostic status. Findings support the relevance of PTC for PTSD symptoms and diagnosis in a Palestinian refugee sample, in line with the cognitive model for PTSD. This is especially relevant for researchers and clinicians working with refugees in conflict areas.",45

Veterans were included in the study if they reported experiencing moderate to high levels of PTG in at least two of the five domains of growth identified in PTG literature. Through semi-structured interviews, participants reported that the factors which mostly contributed to their growth were: (a) remaining connected to veterans or the military, (b) connecting with others and feeling supported by loved ones, (c) working with a counselor, (d) time, and (e) developmental reading. Seven participants reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The narratives provided by participants indicate the importance for clinicians to ask clients about PTG, in addition to PTSD symptoms. This article concludes with the description of clinical implications for working with veterans who have experienced combat-related trauma, and recommendations for future research.",46

The aims of this study were to estimate the use of mental health services and to examine how such use is associated with self-reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers before and after deployment to Afghanistan.Prospectively, 703 Danish soldiers who deployed from January 2009 to August 2009 were followed up with 6 assessments from predeployment to 2.5 years postdeployment in 2012. At assessments, the soldiers responded to a comprehensive questionnaire including a measure of PTSD symptoms (the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version). These self-reported data were combined with individual-level records of receiving psychotherapy from the Military Psychological Division at the Danish Defense and psychiatric treatment from the Danish registers.The prevalence of PTSD symptoms increased over time, and almost 10% of the sample reported high levels of PTSD symptoms 2.5 years postdeployment. Overall, 37% of the soldiers utilized mental health services; 6% utilized psychiatric services, and 12.4% redeemed a prescription for psychiatric medicine. Approximately one-third received psychotherapy at the Military Psychological Division. In those reporting high PTSD symptomatology, 83% utilized 1 or more types of mental health service. At predeployment and homecoming, high PTSD symptomatology was significantly (P < .01) associated with attending psychotherapy, but not with psychiatric treatment or redemption of psychiatric medicine.With time, more soldiers report high PTSD symptoms. Among Danish soldiers with high symptomatology, the utilization of mental health services was high. Most frequently, soldiers with high PTSD symptomatology received psychotherapy at the Military Psychological Division and less frequently received psychiatric treatment.",46

Methods Parent–child dyads ( N = 1,886) were randomly selected and interviewed approximately 18 months after Hurricane Georges hit Puerto Rico (1998), and reinterviewed 12 months later. The outcome variables were parent report of a global rating of children’s physical health, and frequency of medical problems and medical visits in the past year. Results Conservative analyses that accounted for a host of postdisaster health-relevant factors showed that hurricane exposure exerted detrimental influence on physical health at both 18 and 30 months after the event. The moderating role of PCRQ in the relation between hurricane exposure and physical health varied by gender. Conclusion Disasters have long-term potential to influence the physical health of children and adolescents. PCRQ serves as resource but its role in the context of disasters is complex.",46

Longitudinal studies during the year that follows trauma exposure revealed typical symptom trajectories leading to either recovery or protracted PTSD. Thezneurobehavioral correlates of early PTSD symptoms’ trajectories have not been longitudinally explored.Objective: To present the rationale and design of a longitudinal study exploring the relationship between evolving PTSD symptoms and co-occurring cognitive functioning and structural and functional brain imaging parameters.Method: Adult civilians consecutively admitted to a general hospital emergency room (ER) for traumatic injury will be screened for early PTSD symptoms suggestive of chronic PTSD risk, and consecutively evaluated 1, 6 and 14 months following the traumatic event. Consecutive assessments will include structured clinical interviews for PTSD and comorbid disorders, self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms, a web-based assessment of cognitive domains previously linked with PTSD (e.g., memory, executive functions, cognitive flexibility), high-resolution structural MRI of both grey and white matter, functional resting-state connectivity, and fMRI tasks examining emotional reactivity and regulation, as well as motivation processing and sensitivity to risk and reward. Data analyses will explore putative cognitive predictors of non-remitting PTSD, and brain structural and functional correlates of PTSD persistence or recovery.Conclusion: This work will longitudinally document patterns of brain structures, connectivity, and functioning, predictive of (or associated with) emerging PTSD during the critical first year of after the traumatic event. It will thereby inform our understanding of the disorder’s pathogenesis and underlying neuropathology. Challenges to longitudinal MRI studies of recent survivors, and methodological choices used to optimize the study’s design are discussed.",46

https://openalex.org/W2803547003,10.1080/20008198.2018.1463794,"Dissociative symptoms mediate the relation between PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in a sample of military members, veterans, and first responders with PTSD","Background: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is associated with significant functional impairment in important areas, including interpersonal relationships and occupational or educational roles. Preliminary evidence suggests that the dissociative subtype of PTSD (PTSD+DS), characterized by marked symptoms of depersonalization and derealization, is associated with increased functional impairment and disease severity, including among military members and veterans diagnosed with PTSD. Similarly, first responders (e.g. police, fire, paramedics) have also been found to experience dissociative symptoms. Despite these findings, little work has investigated whether dissociative symptoms are related to heightened functional impairment among these populations. Objective: We examined the relation between functional impairment and symptom level variables, including dissociative symptoms of depersonalization and derealization among military members, veterans, and first responders with probable PTSD. We further investigated the hypothesis that dissociative symptoms mediate the relation between PTSD symptomatology and functional impairment. Method: Eighty-one medical charts of inpatients at a residential PTSD treatment programme were accessed via retrospective review. Sixty-two were included in the present analyses. Comparison of means on symptom measures between first responders and military members/veterans were conducted, followed by correlational and mediation analyses. Results: Compared with first responders, military members and veterans showed higher levels of derealization, functional impairment, alexithymia, anxiety, and depression. Within the total sample, dissociative symptoms emerged as the strongest correlate of functional impairment and, among the dissociative symptom clusters, derealization symptoms demonstrated the strongest relation with impairment. Mediation analyses revealed that total dissociative symptoms and derealization symptoms significantly mediated the relation between PTSD symptoms and functional impairment. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of assessing and treating dissociative symptoms, consistent with the dissociative subtype of PTSD, among military members, veterans, and first responders with PTSD. Successful recovery on a functional and symptomatic level may necessitate treatment of dissociative symptoms, particularly derealization.Planteamiento: El trastorno por estrés postraumático (TEPT) se asocia con un deterioro funcional significativo en áreas importantes, incluidas las relaciones interpersonales y los roles ocupacionales o educativos. La evidencia preliminar sugiere que el subtipo disociativo de TEPT (TEPT + SD), caracterizado por síntomas marcados de despersonalización y desrealización, se asocia con mayor deterioro funcional y gravedad de la enfermedad, incluso entre miembros militares y veteranos diagnosticados con TEPT. Del mismo modo, también se ha encontrado que los profesionales en intervención inmediata (por ejemplo, policías, bomberos, paramédicos) también experimentan síntomas disociativos. A pesar de estos hallazgos, pocos han investigado si los síntomas disociativos están relacionados con una mayor deficiencia funcional entre estas poblaciones.Objetivo: Examinamos la relación entre el deterioro funcional y las variables de nivel de síntomas, incluyendo síntomas disociativos de despersonalización, desrealización entre miembros militares, veteranos y profesionales en intervención inmediata con un probable TEPT. Además investigamos la hipótesis de que los síntomas disociativos median la relación entre la sintomatología del TEPT y el deterioro funcional.Método: Se accedió a ochenta y un historiales clínicos de pacientes hospitalizados en un programa residencial de tratamiento de TEPT mediante un análisis retrospectivo. Sesenta y dos fueron incluidos en el presente análisis. Se realizó una comparación de los medios de medición de síntomas entre los profesionales en intervención inmediata y los militares y veteranos, seguida de análisis de correlación y mediación.Resultados: En comparación con los profesionales en intervención inmediata los miembros del ejército y los veteranos mostraron niveles más altos de desrealización, deterioro funcional, alexitimia, ansiedad y depresión.Dentro de la muestra total, los síntomas disociativos surgieron como el correlato más fuerte del deterioro funcional y, entre los grupos de síntomas disociativos, los síntomas de desrealización mostraron la relación más fuerte con el deterioro. Los análisis de mediación revelaron que los síntomas disociativos totales y los síntomas de desrealización mediaban significativamente en la relación entre los síntomas de TEPT y el deterioro funcional.Conclusiones: Estos hallazgos resaltan la importancia de evaluar y tratar los síntomas disociativos, coincidentes con el subtipo disociativo del TEPT, entre los militares, los veteranos y los profesionales en intervención inmediata con TEPT. El éxito de su recuperación a nivel funcional y sintomático puede requerir el tratamiento de los síntomas disociativos, en particular, la desrealización.背景：创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）与重要方面的明显功能障碍相关：包括人际关系和职业或教育。PTSD（PTSD + DS）的分离亚型以人格解体和现实解体症状为特征。初步证据表明，被诊断为PTSD的军人和退伍老兵中，功能受损和疾病严重程度增加与分离症状有关。同样，现场急救人员（例如警察，火警，医务人员）也被发现患有分离症状。尽管有这些发现，但很少研究调查分离症状是否与这些人群中功能受损加剧相关。目标：我们研究了可能发生的军人、退伍老兵和现场急救人员的功能障碍和症状水平之间的关系：包括人格解体，现实解体，情绪抑制，走神，记忆解离和身份分离等症状。我们进一步考察了分离症状中介PTSD症状和功能障碍之间关系的假设方法：回溯性回顾了一个住院PTSD治疗计划的81位住院病人的医疗图表，62名包括在了目前的分析中。现场急救人员与军人/退伍军人症状水平进行平均值比较，然后进行相关分析和中介分析。结果：与现场救援人员相比，军人和退伍老兵表现出较高水平的现实解体、功能障碍、述情障碍、焦虑和抑郁。在总样本中，分离症状是功能障碍最强的相关因子；并且在分离症状群中，人格解体症状表现出与损伤关系最强的关系。 调节分析显示总分离症状和人格解体症状显着中介了PTSD症状和功能障碍之间的关系。结论：这些发现强调了在军人，退伍老兵和患有PTSD的现场急救人员评估和治疗分离症状，与PTSD的分离亚型一样重要。 在功能和症状水平上成功恢复可能需要治疗分离症状，特别是现实解体症状。.",46

The current study used mixture modelling to describe typologies in life stress exposure and availability of protective resources in individuals with and without eating disorders (EDs). Methods A case – control sample ( n = 916) completed measures of stressful life events, resilience protective factors, emotion regulation, and symptoms of EDs, depression and anxiety. We conducted latent class analyses to identify subgroups of stress exposure and profile analyses of emotional regulation and resilience. The resulting two latent variables were combined to explore effects on ED status and symptomatology, depression, and anxiety as distal outcome variables. Results We identified four classes of stressful life events (generally low, some abuse/bullying, sexual/emotional assaults, and high adversity). For protective resources, we identified six profiles that ranged from low to higher levels of protection with variations in social/family resources. The latent protection variable contributed more strongly to the distal outcomes than the latent stress variable, but did not moderate the latent stress and distal outcome variable relationships. Profiles characterized by lower protective resources included higher proportions of individuals with a lifetime ED, and were associated with higher scores on all symptom measures. Conclusions Intra- and interpersonal protective resources were strongly associated with lifetime EDs and current mental health symptom burden after accounting for stressful event exposure, suggesting protective factors may be useful to target in the clinical treatment of patients with ED.",46

The objective of this study is to investigate the attribution of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to the presence of extensive body burn. This was a cross-sectional descriptive and analytical study that took place from May to August 2017 and which involved (50) fifty patients labeled severe burns. The burns were second degree superficial (63.50%) and affected between 1 and 10% of the body surface in 72% of cases. The event appealed to a sense of horror at the mention (28%). Post-traumatic stress disorder was found in 6% of victims. The chi-square test found a significant dependence with a P-value of 0.0043 between the PTSD score and the body surface area burned. The extent of the burn injuries in the victims, in addition to reflecting the severity of the accident, is a risk factor associated with the occurrence of psychotrauma. In a dual preventive and therapeutic approach, psychotraumatological follow-up should be offered to any major burn victim.",46

This prospective study aimed (a) to examine the course of postchemotherapy symptoms of emotional distress, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties among breast cancer survivors and (2) to assess the effect of changes in optimism and subjective stress on the trajectory of these symptoms. Methods Ninety‐eight breast cancer survivors, diagnosed at stages I to III, aged 30 to 74, recruited consecutively (response rate 84.7%) completed fatigue, emotional distress, self‐reported cognitive difficulties, optimism, and subjective stress questionnaires at three points in time: upon enrollment (1‐6 months after completing treatment, Time 1) posttreatment, 6 months (Time 2), and 12 months (Time 3). A linear mixed‐effects model was used to analyze the data. Results Emotional distress decreased between time‐points, level of cognitive difficulties remained stable, and a marginal decrease in fatigue was evident. Optimism or subjective stress predicted changes in each of the symptoms ( P &lt;.01), except for the effect of optimism on cognitive difficulties ( P =.06). The interactions between time and optimism and between time and subjective stress were only significant regarding their effect on emotional distress ( P &lt;.05), showing that the strongest effect of these variables was at Time 2. Conclusion The course of postchemotherapy symptoms shows patterns of stability and change over a 1‐year period. Optimism and subjective perceptions of stress were shown to affect the decrease of symptoms. Therefore, these two factors should be specifically targeted in psycho‐social interventions.",47

We examine whether family members who witness resuscitations have increased post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms at one month following the event.Methods: We identified family members of critically ill patients via our emergency department (ED) electronic health record. Patients were selected based on their geographic triage to an ED critical care room. Family members were called a median of one month post-event and administered the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), a 22-item validated scale that measures post-traumatic distress symptoms and correlates closely with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Family members were placed into two groups based on whether they stated they had witnessed the resuscitation (FWR group) or not witnessed the resuscitation (FNWR group). Data analyses included chi-square test, independent sample t-test, and linear regression controlling for gender and age.Results: A convenience sample of 423 family members responded to the phone interview: 250 FWR and 173 FNWR. The FWR group had significantly higher mean total IES-R scores: 30.4 vs 25.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], -8.73 to -0.75; P&lt;.05). Additionally, the FWR group had significantly higher mean score for the subscales of avoidance (10.6 vs 8.1; 95% CI, -4.25 to -0.94; P&lt;.005) and a trend toward higher score for the subscale of intrusion (13.0 vs 11.4; 95% CI, -3.38 to .028; P = .054). No statistical significant difference was noted between the groups in the subscale of hyperarousal (6.95 vs 6.02; 95% CI, -2.08 to 0.22; P=.121). All findings were consistent after controlling for age, gender, and immediate family member (spouse, parent, children, and grandchildren).Conclusion: Our results suggest that family members who witness ED resuscitations may be at increased risk of PTSD symptoms at one month. This is the first study that examines the effects of family visitation for an unsorted population of very sick patients who would typically be seen in the critical care section of a busy ED.",47

The aim of this study was to examine whether the presence of resilience resources before deployment, and the potential loss of these resources over time, are associated with the risk of PTSD symptoms five years post-deployment. The study focused on Dutch service members, deployed to Afghanistan or the Gulf of Aden. Pre-deployment resilience resources (i.e. coping self-efficacy, team cohesion, and perceived organizational support) were measured in 2012–2013 (n = 786). Five years after deployment a follow-up study (n = 148) measured the same resources as well as PTSD symptoms. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that fewer resources before deployment as well as a post-deployment decline in resources predicted PTSD. Low coping self-efficacy and low perceived organizational support before deployment as well as a decline in these resources over time were significantly related to PTSD symptoms five years post-deployment. This study therefore provides initial support for a relationship between a resource loss process and PTSD symptoms in veterans five years post-deployment.",47

In addition, it examined whether self-reported physical and interpersonal exposure to acts of political violence predicts PTS symptoms beyond the objective exposure effects (i.e., the proximity of participants’ place of residence to high-, moderate-, or low-intensity political violence). A representative sample of 2,992 Jewish high school students (Grades 10 and 11) was taken. We used self-reporting to measure the level of religiosity and the Impact of Events Scale–Revised (IES-R) to measure PTS symptoms. Results show that self-reported exposure to acts of political violence adds a significant additional amount of variance to the prediction of PTS symptoms after objective exposure is already included in the regression equation. Religiosity was found as a risk factor for PTS symptoms such that the greater the religiosity of the adolescents, the higher their PTS symptoms. Therefore, prevention interventions should target the vulnerable group of religious Jewish adolescents.",47

To estimate associations between exposure to the events of September 11, 2001, (9/11) and low birth weight (LBW), preterm delivery (PD), and small size for gestational age (SGA). Methods. We matched birth certificates filed in New York City for singleton births between 9/11 and the end of 2010 to 9/11-related exposure data provided by mothers who were World Trade Center Health Registry enrollees. Generalized estimating equations estimated associations between exposures and LBW, PD, and SGA. Results. Among 3360 births, 5.8% were LBW, 6.5% were PD, and 9% were SGA. Having incurred at least 2 of 4 exposures, having performed rescue or recovery work, and probable 9/11-related posttraumatic stress disorder 2 to 3 years after 9/11 were associated with PD and LBW during the early study period. Conclusions. Disasters on the magnitude of 9/11 may exert effects on reproductive outcomes for several years. Women who are pregnant during and after a disaster should be closely monitored for physical and psychological sequelae. Public Health Implications. In utero and maternal disaster exposure may affect birth outcomes. Researchers studying effects of individual disasters should identify commonalities that may inform postdisaster responses to minimize disaster-related adverse birth outcomes.",47

However, little is known about individual differences in the longitudinal reactions to lockdown. We designed a longitudinal study (a) to identify the various trajectories of symptoms of depression and anxiety in the general population during and after lockdown; (b) to determine which positive psychological resources prevent individuals from falling into groups with the most severe trajectories; (c) to test the mediating role of psychological flexibility. We collected and analysed longitudinal data on a sample of French participants ( N = 1399, M age = 43.4; SD age = 12; 87.8% women) during the end of the first lockdown. Participants were asked to report their psychological resources and (in)flexibility at baseline and symptoms of anxiety and depression at each measurment occasion (five weekly observations from 17 March to 11 May 2020, including baseline). Using growth mixture modelling, seven dynamic profiles of symptoms were identified: four for depression and three for anxiety. Resilience emerged as the most frequent trajectory. Wisdom, optimism, hope, self-efficacy and peaceful disengagement significantly prevented individuals from belonging to the symptomatic groups. Moreover, psychological flexibility emerged as a significant mediator of these effects. This study highlights the importance of cultivating protective factors and psychological flexibility to prevent mental health damage during potentially traumatic events (PTE) and to favour resilience trajectories.",47

We examine this issue in UNICEF's 1995 National Trauma Survey (NTS) of 8-19-year-olds (n = 942) who survived the Rwandan Genocide and lived and attended schools in the community. PTSS were assessed with a symptom checklist based on DSM-IV indexed using an overall score comprising the sum of scores on all items and mean item scores of each of five distinct factors identified in a factor analysis within this sample. Eighty percent of the sample had witnessed massacres; 25%, rape/sexual mutilation. The overall symptom score among children was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than among adolescents. Among the five separate factors, this direct association of age with symptom levels held for two: re-experiencing (p < 0.001) and dysphoric arousal (p < 0.05), but not for the remaining three: avoidance, numbing, and anxious arousal. This discordance in factorial response to violence may help explain prevailing inconsistencies in the age-PTSS association reported to date.",47

However, its lack of empirical evidence of safety and effectiveness has been criticized.To assess the effectiveness of PFA-ABCDE, an original PFA protocol, for preventing PTSD one month after the intervention and decreasing PTSD symptoms at one and six months of follow up.We assessed the eligibility of 1,140 adult survivors of recent trauma (≤ 72 hours) consulting five emergency departments in Chile. Two hundred twenty-one were randomized to receive either PFA-ABCDE (active listening, breathing retraining, categorization of needs, referral to ancillary services, and psychoeducation) or only psychoeducation. We used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to assess PTSD diagnosis. The Posttraumatic Checklist (PCL), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and a 0-10 points analogue visual scale were used to assess PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and immediate distress relief after the intervention.We found no difference between the experimental and control groups in the frequency of PTSD one month after the intervention (PFA-ABCDE = 23/76 [30.3%], psychoeducation = 18/75 [24.0%], adjusted odds ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval = 0.63-3.07, p = .408). Immediately after the intervention, participants who received PFA-ABCDE reported greater distress relief (PFA-ABCDE mean = 9.06, psychoeducation mean = 8.55, Cohen's d = 0.30, p = .038). Fewer PTSD symptoms were reported by those who received PFA-ABCDE one month after the intervention (PFA-ABCDE mean = 36.26, psychoeducation mean = 43.62, Cohen's d = 0.42, p = .033). We found no difference in depressive symptoms at one-month follow up (p = .713) nor in PTSD symptoms six months after the intervention (p = .986).PFA-ABCDE does not prevent PTSD diagnosis, but it provides immediate distress relief and decreases PTSD symptoms in the short term.Antecedentes: Los Primeros Auxilios Psicológicos (PAP) han sido recomendados para prevenir el Trastorno de Estrés Postraumático (TEPT) en supervivientes de trauma.

Doscientos veintiún fueron aleatorizados a recibir PAP-ABCDE (escucha activa, reentrenamiento de la respiración, categorización de necesidades, derivación a redes de apoyo, y psicoeducación) o sólo psicoeducación. Utilizamos la Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) para evaluar el diagnóstico de TEPT. La Posttraumatic Checklist (PCL), la Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), y una escala visual análoga de 0-10 puntos fueron utilizadas para evaluar síntomas de TEPT, síntomas depresivos, y alivio inmediato de distrés luego de la intervención.Resultados: No encontramos diferencia entre el grupo experimental y el grupo control en la frecuencia de TEPT un mes después de la intervención (PAP-ABCDE = 23/76 [30,3%], psicoeducación = 18/75 [24,0%], odds ratio ajustado = 1,39, intervalo de confianza 95% = 0,63-3,07, p = ,408). Inmediatamente después de la intervención los participantes que recibieron PAP-ABCDE reportaron un mayor alivio de distrés (media en PAP = 9,06, media en psicoeducación = 8,55, d de Cohen = 0,30, p = ,038). Menos síntomas de TEPT fueron reportados un mes después de la intervención por aquellos que recibieron PAP-ABCDE (media de PAP-ABCDE = 36,26, media de psicoeducación = 43,62, d de Cohen = 0,42, p = ,033). No encontramos diferencias en síntomas depresivos al mes de seguimiento (p = ,713) ni en síntomas de TEPT seis meses después de la intervención (p = ,986).Conclusiones: Los PAP-ABCDE no previenen el diagnóstico de TEPT, pero brindan alivio inmediato del distrés y disminuyen la severidad de los síntomas del TEPT en el corto plazo.背景: 早期心理急救 (PFA) 已被广泛推荐用于预防创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD)。然而, 其安全性和有效性的缺乏实证证据受到批评。目的: 评估 PFA-ABCDE (原始 PFA 方案) 在干预后 1 个月预防 PTSD 并在随访 1 个月和 6 个月时减少 PTSD 症状的有效性。方法: 我们评估了 1140 名咨询了智利五个急诊科的近期创伤 (≤ 72 小时) 成年幸存者的资格。 221 人随机接受 PFA-ABCDE (积极倾听, 呼吸再训练, 需求分类, 转介辅助服务和心理教育) 或仅接受心理教育。我们使用复合国际诊断访谈 (CIDI) 来评估 PTSD 诊断。创伤后检查表 (PCL), 贝克抑郁量表-II (BDI-II) 和 0-10 分模拟视觉量表用于评估干预后的 PTSD 症状, 抑郁症状和即时痛苦缓解。结果: 我们发现干预后 1 个月的 PTSD 发生率在实验组和对照组之间没有差异 (PFA-ABCDE = 23/76 [30.3%], 心理教育 = 18/75 [24.0%], 调整优势比 = 1.39, 95% 置信区间 = 0.63-3.07, p= .408)。干预一结束, 接受 PFA-ABCDE 的参与者报告了更大的痛苦缓解 (PFA-ABCDE 平均值 = 9.06, 心理教育平均值 = 8.55, Cohen’s d= 0.30, p= .038) 。干预后一个月接受 PFA-ABCDE 的患者报告的 PTSD 症状较少 (PFA-ABCDE 平均值 = 36.26, 心理教育平均值 = 43.62, Cohen’s d= 0.42, p= .033) 。我们发现在 1 个月的随访中抑郁症状 (p= .713) 和干预后 6 个月的 PTSD 症状 (p= .986) 没有差异。结论: PFA-ABCDE 不能预防 PTSD 诊断, 但它可以立即缓解痛苦并在短期内减轻 PTSD 症状。.",47

However, little is known about coping and resilience in multiple disaster contexts. In this study, we focused on spiritual and secular coping resources and the roles they may play in postdisaster resilience. Methods Participants were noncoastal and coastal residents exposed to the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Psychosocial predictors of central interest were (a) spiritual support and (b) use of coping through humor, and both were hypothesized to be associated with resilience. Covariates included group, gender, education, income, social engagement, charitable work done for others, and lifetime trauma. Findings Logistic regression analyses confirmed that spiritual support (odds ratio [ OR ] = 1.11, p ≤ .01) and use of coping through humor ( OR = 1.17, p ≤ .01) were independently and positively associated with resilience. Disruption in charitable work done for others in a typical year before the hurricanes ( OR = 0.49, p ≤ .05) and income of less than $2,000 per month were negatively associated with resilience ( OR = 0.47, p ≤ .05). Conclusions These data show that spirituality, humor, disruptions in charitable work, and low income were all independently associated with resilience in the years after consecutive disasters. Clinical Relevance Experiencing one or more disasters can create chronic psychosocial stress in an individual, which is associated with long‐term health effects such as inflammation and weakened immune function. Recognizing which coping resources bolster resilience rather than harm is important for improving quality of life in disaster victims.",47

Methods 　Self-report questionnaires were used to investigate 287 Israel veterans who fought in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and 166 wives of these veterans. A structure equation model analyzed the multiple mediating effects. Results 　Veterans' PTSD had a significant and positive effect on their wives' PTG before inclusion of the mediators. However, after inserting the mediators (i.e., veterans' disclosure and intimacy and wives' PTSD) the direct effect of veterans' PTSD on their wives' PTG became non-significant. In addition, veterans' PTSD had a 1-step indirect effect on their wives' PTG through wives' PTSD, and veterans' PTSD also had a 2-step indirect effect on their wives' PTSD through the path from veterans' disclosure to veterans' intimacy. Conclusion 　The results indicated that veterans' disclosure and intimacy as well as their wives' PTSD mediate the relation between veterans' PTSD and their wives' PTG.

Research has shown that PTSS that emerged within days of trauma was a robust predictor of PTSD development.To investigate patterns of early stress responses to trauma and their associations with development of PTSD.We recruited 247 civilian trauma survivors from a local hospital emergency department. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) were completed within 2 weeks after the traumatic event. Additionally, 3 months post-trauma 146 of these participants completed a PTSD diagnostic interview using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5.We first used latent profile analysis on four symptom clusters of the PCL-5 and the dissociation symptom cluster of the ASDS and determined that a four-profile model ('severe symptoms', 'moderate symptoms', 'mild symptoms', 'minimal symptoms') was optimal based on multiple fit indices. Gender was found to be predictive of profile membership. We then found a significant association between subgroup membership and PTSD diagnosis (χ2(3) = 11.85, P < 0.01, Cramer's V = 0.263). Post hoc analysis revealed that this association was driven by participants in the 'severe symptoms' profile, who had a greater likelihood of developing PTSD.These findings fill the knowledge gap of identifying possible subgroups of individuals based on their PTSS severity during the early post-trauma period and investigating the relationship between subgroup membership and PTSD development, which have important implications for clinical practice.",47

Results from the national health and resilience in veterans study,"Military combat trauma is often associated with negative outcomes, including high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Less is known, however, about whether military combat trauma may foster posttraumatic growth (PTG), which has been observed in relation to other trauma types, in representative samples of veterans. We analyzed data from veterans who participated in the National Health and Resilience in veterans Study who reported a military-related trauma (n = 210). Participants completed measures of trauma history, combat exposure, PTSD symptoms, PTG, functioning, and quality of life (QOL). Bivariate correlations, regression analyses, analyses of covariance, and fit of linear and quadratic functions were used to examine relationships between PTSD symptom clusters, PTG and its subdomains, and functioning. Number of deployments (β=0.23) and lifetime PTSD symptom severity (β=0.19), particularly re-experiencing symptoms (β=0.37), were independently associated with greater PTG. An inverted-U-shaped quadratic function provided the best fit for the relationship between PTSD symptoms and PTG (R2 =0.22). Greater PTG was associated with greater mental functioning (β=0.15) and QOL (β=0.24). The inability to make casual inferences in this cross-sectional study; possible bias related to self-report measures; and the lengthy time period between index trauma and assessment of PTSD and PTG. PTG is relatively common among combat veterans, particularly among those with PTSD, and is associated with better mental functioning and QOL. Positive psychology interventions to bolster PTG may help promote functional outcomes in this population.",47

After a stillbirth at ≥ 24 weeks gestational age, 65 women completed structured clinical interviews and questionnaires assessing PTSD symptoms, cognitive predictors (appraisals, dysfunctional strategies), and risk factors (perceived social support, trauma history, obstetric history) at 3 and 6 months. PTSD symptoms decreased between 3 and 6 months (Cohen's d ranged .34-.52). Regression analyses also revealed a specific positive relationship between Rumination and concurrent frequency of PTSD symptoms (β = .45). Negative Self-View and Negative World-View related positively and Self-Blame related negatively to concurrent number of PTSD symptoms (β = .48, .44, -.45, respectively). Suppression and Distraction predicted a decrease and Numbing predicted an increase in time-lagged number of PTSD symptoms (β = -.33, -.28, .30, respectively). Risk factors for PTSD symptoms were younger age (β = -.25), lower income (β = -.29), fewer previous pregnancies (β = -.31), and poorer perceived social support (β = -.26). Interventions addressing negative appraisals, dysfunctional strategies, and social support are recommended for mothers with PTSD following stillbirth.

Further, 111 adult victims of violent crime completed the Structured Clinical Interview, the Modified PTSD Symptom Scale, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire, and the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory. Hierarchical regressions and chi-square tests were conducted for continuous and categorical measures of PTSD. Extremely elevated scores of peritraumatic dissociation (PD) and peritraumatic distress (PDI) were obtained for both sexes. Greater PDI and PD were related to more PTSD symptoms. No significant interaction effects with gender emerged. These results remained when acute stress disorder was controlled for. Analyses on categorical data produced similar results. Victims of violent crimes recall severe peritraumatic reactions. The more severe these are, the more likely they are to develop sign...",47

We examined associations of 9/11-related exposures with mortality in WTC Health Registry enrollees diagnosed with cancer before and after 9/11/2001.This is a longitudinal cohort study of 5061 enrollees with a first-ever primary invasive cancer diagnosis between 1995 and 2015 and followed through 2016. Based on the timing of first cancer diagnosis, pre-9/11 (n = 634) and post-9/11 (n = 4427) cancer groups were examined separately. 9/11-related exposures included witnessing traumatic events, injury on 9/11, and 9/11-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Associations of exposures with all-cause mortality were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression. In the post-9/11 group, cancer-specific mortality was evaluated by enrollee group (WTC rescue/recovery workers vs. non-workers) using Fine and Gray's proportional sub-distribution hazard models, adjusting for baseline covariates, tumor characteristics, and treatment.In the pre-9/11 group, 9/11-related exposures were not associated with all-cause mortality. In the post-9/11 group, increased risk of all-cause mortality was associated with PTSD (adjusted HR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.11-1.65), but not with injury or witnessing traumatic events. Cancer-specific mortality was not statistically significantly associated with 9/11-related exposures. In rescue/recovery workers, increased non-cancer mortality risk was associated with PTSD (aHR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.13-4.00) and witnessing ≥3 traumatic events (aHR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.13-3.55).We did not observe associations between 9/11-related exposures and cancer-specific mortality. Similar to findings in the non-cancer WTC exposed population, PTSD was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality in cancer patients.",48

The etiology of poor family functioning may also differ for men and women serving in the military. The current study recruited U.S. military service members (N = 343, 28% women, 59% White) preparing to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan to examine the effects of symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress (PTS), and alcohol use (frequency and quantity) on family functioning. We also sought to identify whether those effects differed between genders. Across participants, PTS was the only factor significantly associated with worse family functioning (β = .01, SE = .00, t(251.99) = 2.03, p = .043), however the effect of depression was similar in magnitude and trending toward significance (β = .01, SE = .00, t(297.49) = 1.96, p = .051). Interactions between gender, mental health, and alcohol use were non-significant. Findings suggest that addressing service members’ PTS and depression symptoms pre-deployment could improve family functioning. Gender may not be a major factor for pre-deployment mental health and family functioning, although more research is warranted. Contrary to expectations, alcohol use was unrelated to family functioning. Future studies should consider using measures of drinking that capture alcohol-related problems in addition to consumption. As service members prepare to deploy, it is important to understand which factors are most impactful on family functioning as this may help target preventative interventions during the pre-deployment stage.Keywords: Militarypre-deploymentfamily functioningmental healthanxietydepressionstressposttraumatic stressalcohol usegender differences Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",48

Emotion dysregulation has been posited as one factor that may account for observed links between polyvictimization and mental health problems. Accordingly, the current study used latent class analysis to identify patterns of trauma exposure and examine their associations with emotion dysregulation and mental health symptoms. Undergraduates (N = 298) completed a cross-sectional survey of trauma exposure, recent mental health symptoms, and emotion dysregulation. Results revealed a predominately non-interpersonal trauma class (18%), a moderate exposure class (71%), and a polyvictimized class (11%). Polyvictims reported more trauma types, more symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, and anxiety, and more difficulties with emotion regulation than the other two classes. Relative to the predominately non-interpersonal class, a statistically significant indirect effect of trauma exposure on PTS, depression, and anxiety symptoms via emotion dysregulation was observed for polyvictims but not for the moderate exposure class. Although limited by sole reliance on cross-sectional, self-report data, these findings suggest that the pathways linking trauma exposure and mental health symptoms may differ as a function of the pattern of victimization experienced.",48

Two groups of SWs were examined: SWs with high exposure to rocket attacks (n = 50) and SWs with low exposure to rocket attacks (n = 52). Measures included objective, subjective, and professional exposure; PTS; vicarious traumatization (VT); resilience; and PTG. Differences between the two groups were found regarding objective, subjective, and professional exposure, as well as PTS, VT, and PTG. No differences were found regarding resilience. PTS and PTG were positively associated. An interaction between group and resilience in predicting PTS and PTG was found. In the highly exposed group, resilience was negatively associated with PTS and positively with PTG, whereas for the low-exposed group resilience was not associated with PTS and was negatively associated with PTG. The discussion focuses on the need to understand the role of resilience and PTG in the psychological reaction of SWs to direct as well as indirect trauma; it also weighs the possibility that PTG serves as a salutogenic variable under high-trauma exposure but as an illusionary means of self-enhancement under low-level exposure.",48

Research supports the role that exposure, loss, and disruption play in increasing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) severity in children following disasters (La Greca, Silverman, Vernberg, Prinstein, 1996; Verberg et al., 1996). However, there are no assessments or questionnaires that have investigated what type of events during and following a hurricane are most predictive of post-traumatic stress reactions. Using logistic regression analyses, the current study examines children’s hurricane experiences and post-hurricane events in order to develop as assessment tool with psychometric properties that predicts post-traumatic stress symptomatology in children. The 20 items retained for the Hurricane Experiences and Life Disruption (HELD) Questionnaire were found to be significantly predictive of PTSD symptomatology.",48

However, mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is still open for discussion.This study aimed to compare psychological symptoms of MTBI patients with those without MTBI considering demographic auxiliary variables.This prospective cohort study was conducted on 50 MTBI patients and 50 healthy subjects aged 15 - 65 years. Psychological assessment was carried out six months post-injury using a series of self-report measures including the brief symptom inventory (BSI) scale. Other information of the individuals in the two groups was recorded prospectively. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test, t-test, and multiple linear regression tests.There was a significant difference between the MTBI patients and healthy subjects in all subscales and total score of BSI. Our findings showed that obsession-compulsion and anxiety subscales were significantly more common in the MTBI patients than in the healthy subjects. Also, multivariate regression analysis six months post- injury showed that head trauma and substance abuse can have an effect on psychological symptoms.Mild traumatic brain injuries despite of the normal CT scan and history of substance abuse are closely related to psychological symptoms. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with brain trauma 6 months post-injury and subjects with a history of substance abuse be evaluated for psychological distress to support better rehabilitation.",48

Methods: The sample consists of 1,029 students aged 11–17 year old. Of them 533 (51.8%) were female and 496 (48.2%) were male. The following measures were used in the study: War-Traumatic Events Checklist (W-TECh), Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire – Adolescent Short Form (TEIQue-ASF), prosocial behaviour (as part of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - SDQ), parental support scale, Parental Psychological Control scale, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders Symptoms Scale (PTSDSS) and the depression scale. Results: 88.4% (N: 909) experienced personal trauma, 83.7% (N: 861) witnessed trauma to others, and 88.3% (N: 908) have seen demolition of property during the war, mostly by boys. The results also demonstrated that the prevalence of PTSD diagnosis according to DSM-V is 53.5% (N: 549). Further, there is a negative correlation between trait EI and prosocial behaviour in one hand and parental psychological control and PTSD and depression symptoms in the other hand. Likewise, a negative correlation was found between parental support and depression symptoms. Low trait EI and parental psychological control significantly mediated the relationship between exposure to war trauma, and PTSD and depression. In addition, negative parenting factors and low prosocial behavior significantly predicted depression. Conclusion: Trait EI and parental support can be utilized in interventions to empower children and adolescents’ emotional abilities, to strengthen their resilience in facing traumatic event exposure, and thus reduce its effect on PTSD and depression symptoms.",48

The primary aim of this study was to assess the psychiatric outcomes 6 years after a severe injury and their subsequent impact on long-term disability. The secondary aim was to investigate the relationship between a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and long-term psychiatric disorder and its impact on disability.Methods: From April 2004 to February 2006, randomly selected injury patients admitted to 4 hospitals across Australia were assessed during hospitalization and at 72 months after trauma (N = 592). Injury characteristics, the presence of an mTBI (ICD-9 criteria), and previous psychiatric history were assessed during hospitalization. Structured clinical interviews for psychiatric disorders (DSM-IV and DSM-5) and a self-report measure of disability (WHODAS II) were administered at 72 months.Results: At 72 months after a severe injury, 28% of patients met criteria for at least 1 psychiatric disorder, with 45% of those presenting with comorbid diagnoses. The most prevalent psychiatric disorder was a major depressive episode (11%) followed by substance use disorder (9%), agoraphobia (9%), posttraumatic stress disorder (6%), and generalized anxiety disorder (6%). The presence of any psychiatric disorder was found to increase the risk for disability (P < .001, odds ratio = 6.04). An mTBI was found to increase the risk for having some anxiety disorders but not to increase disability by itself.Conclusions: The long-term psychiatric consequences of severe injury are substantial and represent a significant contributor to long-term disability. This study points to an important intersection between injury and psychiatric disorder as a leading contributor to disease burden and suggests this growing burden will impose new challenges on health systems.",48

Thus, this study aims to explore suicidal ideation and attempts in a community sample of Palestinian students and identify the extent to which clinical variables are associated with suicidal ideation. Method: A cross-sectional design was utilized in this study, and 303 college and university students aged 18 to 23 from seven campuses in the Palestinian territory voluntarily and anonymously completed self-report questionnaires that assessed 12 months of suicidal ideation and attempts, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, and sleep problems. Results: The results showed high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts within the last 12 months. Severe symptoms of PTSS, depression, and sleep problems were reported compared with other college samples. An exploratory path analysis showed that PTSS is directly associated with suicidal ideation and indirectly by its association with sleep problems and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: The results highlight the elevated mental health difficulties of students living under prolonged exposure to violence and could be helpful to policy and decision-makers in health care and academic institutions in implementing and design interventions aim to reduce depression and PTSS. Screening for PTSS and depression is a vital first step in suicide prevention efforts in college students exposed to trauma. Future studies should assess the types of traumatic stress exposure and health risk behaviors to offer a more in-depth view. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).",48

To elucidate the discrepancies, the present study examined the interaction between rape acknowledgement and ambivalent sexism in relation to depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.The analyzed sample included 128 female rape survivors who were drawn from a larger college sample of 1,595 participants. The participants completed measures of sexual assault experiences, ambivalent sexism, and depression and PTSD symptoms.The results supported a significant interaction between acknowledgement status and benevolent sexism in relation to both depression and PTSD symptoms. Conversely, the present study failed to find support for an interaction between acknowledgment status and hostile sexism.The clinical implications suggest that rather than seeing acknowledging rape as essential to the recovery process, clinicians should assess for and take into account other factors that may contribute to psychological functioning. Additionally, the findings support that more complex models of trauma recovery should be investigated with the goal of working toward a more comprehensive understanding of the longitudinal process of rape acknowledgment.",48

The present study thus examined psychosocial differences according to the respondent status in a 5-year follow-up survey among participants in the prospective health surveys on survivors of the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami Disaster study in Iwate Prefecture, Japan.We analyzed data from 10,203 Japanese survivors aged ≥18 years (mean age, 65.6 years; 38.0% men) and who underwent health examinations at baseline in 2011. Participants were classified into responders and nonresponders according to their 2015 health examination participation status. Psychological distress was evaluated using the Kessler 6 scale and categorized as none, mild, and severe. Multinominal logistic regression was used to examine the risk of psychological distress in relation to participation status.In the 2015 survey, 6,334 of 6,492 responders and 1,686 of 3,356 nonresponders were analyzed. The most common reasons for nonparticipation in the survey were participated in other health examinations, examined at a hospital, and did not have time to participate. Nonresponse in males was associated only with mild psychological stress, whereas nonresponse in females was associated with mild and severe psychological distress.Nonresponders in the follow-up survey had a higher risk of psychological distress than responders.

The contribution of factors such as health care continuity and psychological support reinforces the importance of specific postdisaster resources to meet the needs of older adults following hurricanes. These results suggest the importance of designing hurricane preparedness guidelines specifically for older adults.",48

The predictive and moderating effects of the child's baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and parent's psychopathology were evaluated using linear mixed models (LMM) from pre- to post-treatment and from pre- to 3- and 12-month follow-ups.At post-treatment and 3-month follow-up, youth with an index trauma of sexual abuse, severe symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, more comorbid disorders, negative posttraumatic beliefs, and with a parent with more severe psychopathology fared worse in both treatments. For children with more severe self-reported PTSD symptoms at baseline, the (exploratory) moderator analysis showed that the EMDR group improved more than the CBWT group, with the opposite being true for children and parents with a less severe clinical profile.The most consistent finding from the predictor analyses was that parental symptomatology predicted poorer outcomes, suggesting that parents should be assessed, supported and referred for their own treatment where indicated. The effect of the significant moderator variables was time-limited, and given the large response rate (>90%) and brevity (<4 hours) of both treatments, the present findings suggest a focus on implementation and dissemination, rather than tailoring, of evidence-based trauma-focused treatments for paediatric PTSD tied to a single event.Antecedentes: Dado que pocos ECA (ensayos controlados aleatorizados) han comparado tratamientos activos para el TEPT pediátrico, se sabe poco acerca de si las variables basales (es decir, pre-aleatorización) predicen o moderan los resultados en los tratamientos evaluados.Objetivo: Identificar predictores y moderadores de los resultados del TEPT pediátrico para la Terapia de Reprocesamiento y Desensibilización por Movimientos Oculares (EMDR) y la Terapia de Escritura Cognitiva Conductual (CBWT en sus siglas en ingles).Método: Los datos se obtuvieron como parte de un ensayo controlado aleatorizado multicéntrico de hasta seis sesiones (de hasta 45 minutos cada una) de terapia EMDR, CBWT o lista de espera, que incluyó a 101 jóvenes (de 8 a 18 años de edad) con un diagnóstico de TEPT (total/subumbral) vinculado a un solo evento. Los efectos predictivos y moderadores de las características sociodemográficas y clínicas basales del niño y la psicopatología de los padres se evaluaron mediante modelos lineales mixtos (MLM) desde antes y después del tratamiento y desde antes hasta los 3 y 12 meses de seguimiento.Resultados: En el post-tratamiento y en el seguimiento a los 3 meses, los jóvenes con un trauma índice de abuso sexual, síntomas severos de TEPT, ansiedad, depresión, más trastornos comórbidos, creencias postraumáticas negativas y con un padre con psicopatología más severa obtuvieron los peores resultados en ambos tratamientos. Para los niños con síntomas de TEPT auto-informados más graves al inicio del estudio, el análisis del moderador (exploratorio) mostró que el grupo EMDR mejoró más que el grupo CBWT, siendo lo opuesto para los niños y los padres con un perfil clínico menos grave.Conclusiones: El hallazgo más consistente de los análisis de predictores fue que la sintomatología de los padres predijo peores resultados, lo que sugiere que los padres deben ser evaluados, apoyados y referidos para su propio tratamiento cuando esté indicado. El efecto de las variables moderadoras significativas fue limitado en el tiempo, y dada la gran tasa de respuesta (> 90%) y la brevedad (<4 horas) de ambos tratamientos, los presentes hallazgos sugieren un enfoque en la implementación y diseminación, en lugar de la adaptación, de tratamientos centrados en el trauma basados en la evidencia para el TEPT pediátrico vinculados a un solo evento.背景: 由于很少有 RCT 比较儿科 PTSD 的积极治疗, 因此对基线 (即随机分组前) 变量是否或者哪些可以预测或调节评估治疗的结果知之甚少。;目的: 确定眼动脱敏与再加工疗法 (EMDR) 和认知行为写作疗法 (CBWT) 的儿科 PTSD 结果的预测因素和调节因素。;方法: 数据获取于一项多中心, 随机对照试验的一部分, 该试验涉及 101 名有单次事件PTSD 诊断 (完全/亚阈值) 青年 (8-18 岁) 参加了最多 6 次 (每次最多 45 分钟) 的 EMDR 治疗, CBWT 或候补名单。;从治疗前到治疗后以及从治疗前到 3个月和 12个月的随访, 使用线性混合模型 (LMM) 评估儿童基线社会人口学和临床特征以及父母精神病的预测和调节作用。;结果: 在治疗后和 3 个月的随访中, 有性虐待相关创伤, PTSD 严重症状, 焦虑, 抑郁, 更多共病障碍, 消极的创伤后信念以及父母有更严重精神病的青少年的情况在这两种治疗中都更糟。;对于基线自我报告的 PTSD 症状更严重的儿童, (探索性) 调节分析表明 EMDR 组比 CBWT 组改善更多, 而对于临床特征较轻的儿童和父母则相反。;结论: 预测分析中最一致的发现是父母的症状预测了较差的结果, 这表明父母应该在有需要的情况下接受评估, 支持和转诊以进行自己的治疗。;显著调节变量的效应是有时间限制的, 并且鉴于两种治疗的大反应率 (>90%) 和简短性(<4 小时), 目前的研究结果建议关注实施和传播, 而不是针对单个事件相关的儿科 PTSD 量身定制的循证创伤治疗.",49

This study examined associations of pre-deployment insomnia with post-deployment post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidal ideation among US Army soldiers. Soldiers from three Brigade Combat Teams completed surveys 1–2 months before deploying to Afghanistan in 2012 (T0), on return from deployment (T1), 3 months later (T2), and 9 months later (T3). Logistic regression was performed to estimate associations of pre-deployment (T0) insomnia with post-deployment (T2 or T3) PTSD and suicidal ideation among respondents who completed surveys at all waves (n = 4645). A hierarchy of models incorporated, increasing controls for pre-deployment risk factors and deployment experiences. Pre-deployment insomnia was associated with increased risk of post-deployment PTSD (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.58% to 3.82%, p < .0005) and suicidal ideation (AOR = 2.78, 95% CI = 2.07% to 3.74%, p < .0005) in models adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and prior deployment history. Adjustment for other pre-deployment risk factors and deployment experiences attenuated these associations; however, insomnia remained significantly associated with post-deployment PTSD (AOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.19% to 1.89%, p = .001) and suicidal ideation (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.04% to 1.95%, p = .027). Subgroup models showed that pre-deployment insomnia was associated with incident PTSD (AOR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.17% to 2.07%, p = .003) and suicidal ideation (AOR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.16% to 2.40%, p = .006) among soldiers with no pre-deployment history of these problems. Pre-deployment insomnia contributed to prediction of post-deployment PTSD and suicidal ideation in Army soldiers, suggesting that detection of insomnia could facilitate targeting of risk mitigation programs. Future studies should investigate whether treatment of insomnia helps prevent PTSD and suicidal ideation among deployed service members.",49

The treatment program was implemented by the teachers trained by the study team to deliver a weekly, eight-session, protocol-based intervention in school setting. The degree of the fidelity to the original program was tested via video-recordings and subsequent analyses of the sessions. Effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated by a pre-test/post-test comparison using the CPTS-RI, Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS), and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).Results: All participants were accompanied minors. A significant proportion of them had either witnessed or been personally exposed to traumatic events. Statistically significant reduction in post-intervention evaluation was observed in the SCAS total score (t = 3.73, p = 0.001); CPTS-RI total score (t = 2.72, p = 0.011) and in the intrusive (t = 3.88, p = 0.001) and arousal (t = 2.60, p = 0.015) symptoms of the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In line with improvement in emotional problems as revealed in the anxiety and PTSD scales, the SDQ subcategory of the emotional problems was the only symptom area that showed a significant improvement (t = 2.85, p = 0.008). No significant change was seen in the SDQ subcategories of conduct (t = 1.01, p = 0.32), hyperactivity (t = 1.30, p = 0.20), peer problems (t = .66, p = 0.51), or in prosocial behavior (t = 2.15, p = 0.039). A significant proportion of the participants did no longer meet the diagnostic threshold for anxiety (p = 0.001) and PTSD (p = 0.021) after completion of the intervention. However, the post-intervention SDQ subcategories and the total SDQ score showed no significant difference as compared with the pre-intervention group.Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first interventional study reporting promising results from a school-based, teacher-led and culturally sensitive psychological intervention program for refugee children in Turkey. Such protocol-based interventions need to be examined in controlled designs and larger samples so that a well-established intervention can be created and disseminated to provide the psychosocial support for this vulnerable and traumatized population.",49

Demographic and injury-related factors account for a small proportion of variance in participation post-injury. Personal factors such as resilience may also impact outcomes. This study aimed to examine the association of resilience alongside demographic, injury-related, cognitive, emotional, and family factors with participation following TBI. It was hypothesized that resilience would make an independent contribution to participation outcomes after TBI. Participants included 245 individuals with mild-severe TBI [Mage = 44.41, SDage = 16.09; post traumatic amnesia (PTA) duration M 24.95 days, SD 45.99] who completed the Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools-Objective (PART-O), TBI Quality of Life Resilience scale, Family Assessment Device General Functioning Scale, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, National Adult Reading Test, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale an average 4.63 years post-injury (SD 3.02, R 0.5-13). Multiple regression analyses were used to examine predictors of PART-O scores as the participation measure. Variables in the model accounted for a significant 38% of the variability in participation outcomes, F(13, 211) = 9.93, p < 0.05, R2 = 0.38, adjusted R2 = 0.34. Resilience was a significant predictor of higher participation, along with shorter PTA duration, more years since injury, higher education and IQ, and younger age. Mediation analyses revealed depression mediated the relationship between resilience and participation. As greater resilience may protect against depression and enhance participation this may be a focus of intervention.",49

In addition, liability to develop these moderately heritable disorders is partly determined by common genetic variance, which is starting to be uncovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). However, it is currently unknown to what extent genetic vulnerability and trauma interact. We investigated whether genetic risk based on summary statistics of large GWASs for PTSD and MDD predisposed individuals to report an increase in MDD and PTSD symptoms in a prospective military cohort (N = 516) at five time points after deployment to Afghanistan: one month, six months and one, two and five years. Linear regression was used to analyze the contribution of polygenic risk scores (PRSs, at multiple p-value thresholds) and their interaction with deployment-related trauma to the development of PTSD- and depression-related symptoms. We found no main effects of PRSs nor evidence for interactions with trauma on the development of PTSD or depressive symptoms at any of the time points in the five years after military deployment. Our results based on a unique long-term follow-up of a deployed military cohort suggest limited validity of current PTSD and MDD polygenic risk scores, albeit in the presence of minimal severe psychopathology in the target cohort. Even though the predictive value of PRSs will likely benefit from larger sample sizes in discovery and target datasets, progress will probably also depend on (endo)phenotype refinement that in turn will reduce etiological heterogeneity.",49

One possible way to prevent mental health problems is to build-up coping resources that promote resilience to the effects of disaster work. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a resilience building workshop, the Disaster Worker Resiliency Training Program (DWRT), in disaster workers previously exposed to Hurricane Sandy. Disaster workers (N = 167) were randomly assigned to the DWRT workshop (n = 78) or a waitlist (n = 89). Workers completed self-report measures on healthy lifestyle behaviors, perceived stress, depression, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms at baseline and 3-month follow-up. They also completed a measure assessing subsequent trauma-exposure between the baseline and 3-month post-intervention. Participants in the workshop condition, as compared to those in a waitlist control, reported significantly greater improvements from pre-intervention (T1) to 3-month follow-up (T2) in healthy lifestyle behaviors (η2 = .03; p = .03), stress management (η2 = .03, p = .04), and spiritual growth (η2 = .03, p = .02). Among participants reporting subsequent trauma exposures between T1 and T2 (n = 101), participants in the waitlist condition, were more likely to report significant increases in perceived stress (η2 = .07, p < .01), PTSD (η2 = .05, p = .03), and depression (η2 = .07, p < .01) symptoms. Participation in the resilience workshop promoted engagement in positive health behaviors and reduced the incidence of mental health symptoms, especially when administered prior to a repeat trauma exposure. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term health effects of participation in the program.",49

Aims To provide a first assessment of major factors associated with distress and dysfunctional behaviour following the disasters. Method All refugee families living in Miyagi were sent a questionnaire 10–12 months after the disasters. 21 981 participants (73%) returned questionnaires. Questions assessed psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, K6), dysfunctional behaviours, demographics, event exposure, change in physical activity, household visitors and emotional support. Results Nine percent scored 13+ on the K6 indicating risk of severe mental illness. Psychological distress was greater among Fukushima refugees. Demographic variables, family loss, illness history and change in physical activity were associated with psychological distress and dysfunctional behaviours. Associations between psychological distress and dysfunction and visitors/supporters depended on relation to supporter.

We assessed if similar trends occur in the UK Armed Forces. We selected UK studies based on our data base of King’s Centre for Military Health Research publications from 2006 until January 2016 with at least one of the following measures: PTSD checklist-civilian version (PCL-C), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). The studies included personnel assessed for these outcomes after their most recent deployment. A search in Medline, Psycho-Info and Embase confirmed that no relevant publication was missed. Twenty one thousand, seven hundred and forty-six deployed personnel from nine studies contributed to the meta-analyses by time since end of deployment in the PTSD analysis. The number of studies for period of time varied from two to four studies.

However, it has been hypothesized that in extreme situations such as major disasters where positive expectations cannot overcome the grim reality on the ground, being optimistic might be a disadvantage. To test this mismatch hypothesis, this study explores whether higher pre-disaster dispositional optimism is associated with higher posttraumatic stress (PTS) and depressive symptoms among individuals who experienced the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. Information on optimism was collected from community-dwelling residents aged ≥65 years seven months before the 2011 Earthquake/Tsunami in Iwanuma, a Japanese city located 80-km from the epicenter. Data on disaster-related personal experiences (e.g., loss of relatives or friends/housing damage), as well as depressive and PTS symptoms, were collected during a follow-up survey in 2013, 2.5 years after the earthquake and tsunami. Multiple logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate the associations between disaster experiences, optimism, and depressive/PTS symptoms among 962 participants. Higher pre-disaster dispositional optimism was associated with lower odds of developing depressive symptoms (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.95) and PTS symptoms (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.99) after the earthquake. Contrary to the mismatch hypothesis, high dispositional optimism buffered the adverse impact of housing damage on depressive symptoms (interaction term coefficient = −0.63, p = 0.0431), but not on PTS symptoms. In contrast to the mismatch hypothesis, the results suggest that dispositional optimism is a resilience resource among survivors of a disaster.",49

It is critical to identify risk factors for parenting difficulties even prior to parenthood. Pre-parenthood beliefs and expectations remain stable, are tied to later parenting behaviors, and thus may reveal a potential point of prevention for later parenting difficulties. However, to date, childhood maltreatment has not been investigated in regard to parenting expectations and beliefs among non-parents. The aim of the current study was to determine whether forms of cumulative maltreatment was related to more negative expectations of parenthood (i.e. infant, partner, self, social) and children’s development among 477 non-parents (M = 26.49SD = 8.34; 70% female; 63.3% White). Levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and exposure to other traumatic events were also examined. Cumulative maltreatment was not associated with perceptions of parenthood nor with negative and unrealistic expectations about child development. Yet, greater levels of PTSS were tied to more negative parenting expectations in several domains (B = −.07 - −.14), which suggests that trauma symptoms, rather than maltreatment experiences, may be more detrimental to parenting expectations. Interestingly, greater exposure to other traumatic events were associated with more positive parenting expectations (B = .11–.13). These findings may speak to the resilience of maltreatment survivors, and trauma survivors in general, who are not suffering from PTSS with regard to expectations about parenthood.",49

We examined for predictors and compared the data-driven categories of patients with a priori operational definitions of treatment response.Secondary data analysis using growth mixture modelling (GMM). Missing data were imputed. Trajectories of self-reported depressive symptoms were plotted using scores taken at six nominal time points over 86 weeks from randomisation in all 465 patients.A piecewise GMM categorised patients into two classes with initially similar and subsequently distinct trajectories. Both groups had a significant decline in depressive symptoms over the first 18 weeks. Eighty-four per cent (84.1%, n = 391) of patients were classed as 'continued-improvers' with symptoms reducing over the duration of the study. A further class of 15.9% (n = 74) of patients were termed 'halted-improvers' with higher baseline depression scores, faster early recovery but no further improvement after 18 weeks. Presence of baseline comorbidity somewhat increased membership to the halted-improvers class (OR = 1.40, CI: 1.00-1.96). By end of study, compared with classes, a clinical remission cut-off score (≤27) and a symptom reduction score (≥50%) indexing treatment response misclassified 15% and 31% of cases, respectively.A fast reduction in depressive symptoms in the first few weeks of treatment may not indicate a good prognosis. Halted improvement is only seen after 18 weeks of treatment. Longitudinal modelling may improve the precision of revealing differential responses to treatment. Improvement in depressive symptoms may be somewhat better in the year after treatment than previously considered.",50

Yet, there remains limited empirical evidence for the mechanisms that might drive either PTSD or complex features in this group, and ongoing debate about the suitability of existing cognitive behavioural models and their related NICE-recommended treatments. In a prospective study of young people in out-of-home care, we sought to identify demographic and cognitive processes that may contribute to the maintenance of both PTSD symptom and complex features.We assessed 120 10- to 18-year-olds in out-of-home care and their primary carer at two assessments: an initial assessment and 12-month follow-up. Participants completed questionnaires on trauma history, PTSD symptoms and complex features, while young people only also self-reported on trauma-related (a) maladaptive appraisals, (b) memory quality and (c) coping. Social workers reported on maltreatment severity.Young people's maltreatment severity was not a robust predictor of either PTSD symptoms or complex features. All three cognitive processes were moderately-to-strongly correlated with baseline and 12-month PTSD symptoms and complex features, with maladaptive appraisals the most robust unique driver of both, even when controlling for initial PTSD symptom severity.Existing cognitive models of PTSD are applicable in this more complex sample of young people. The model was also found to be applicable to the additional features of complex PTSD, with the same processes driving both outcomes at both time points. Clinical implications are discussed.",50

Patients in the WTC EHC were initially enrolled for physical symptoms, most of which were respiratory, however a large portion of the enrollees scored positive for probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this paper we identify patient characteristics associated with probable PTSD. We also determine the characteristics associated with the longitudinal change of PTSD symptoms, including persistence and remittance, using the widely used Posttraumatic Check List-17 (PCL) cut-off value of 44, as well as changes in PCL total score and symptom cluster scores in patients of Low and High PTSD symptom severity. Few patients with elevated scores achieved a score below 44. However, longitudinal improvement in PCL score at follow-up was identified for patients with High PTSD scores (PCL &gt; 57.5). Changes in PCL symptom clusters differed between those with High and Low PCL scores. These data suggest improvement over time in PCL score that differs depending on the severity of the score and variable responses in the PCL symptom clusters.",50

Potential moral injury and atrocity was significantly associated with all outcomes except for alcohol use disorder, and combat was significantly associated with the arousal PTSD symptom cluster and depressive symptom severity. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the association between combat experiences and PTSD symptom, depression, and anxiety severity. Clinically, it stresses the importance of evaluating specific traumatic events to improve treatment outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",50

However, their actual mechanism of impact remains under-researched. The aim of this study was therefore to explore protective and promotive resilience mechanisms to inform future interventions and policy. Promotive resilience is seen as a direct main effect and protective resilience as a moderating effect. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of Syrian youth recently resettled in Norway, aged 13-24 years. Regression and moderation analyses were used to explore different interactions, including moderated mediation using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Result: A direct main effect of promotive resilience was found for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and general mental distress, but not for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). No moderating effects of protective resilience were found. Post-migration stressors mediated the effects of potentially traumatic events (PTE) from war and flight, and this indirect effect was present at all levels of resilience. Conclusion: Despite high risk exposure and mental distress, resilience was also high. Broad resilience interventions targeting multiple factors would likely benefit the group, but these should include both individual assets and building supportive environments. Additionally, reducing current stress and providing treatment for those in need could enable recovery and increase the efficacy of resilience factors already present.",50

Weekly self-reported primary panic disorder symptoms and secondary depressive symptoms were analysed.Results: primary panic disorder symptoms and secondary depressive symptoms improved significantly during the course of treatment, and at six months follow-up. Parallel process latent growth curve modelling showed that the trajectory of depressive symptoms and trajectory of panic disorder symptoms were significantly related. A supplementary analysis with cross-lagged panel modelling showed that (1) pre-treatment depressive symptoms predicted a positive effect of panic disorder symptoms early in treatment; (2) high early treatment panic disorder symptoms predicted low depressive symptoms at post-treatment.Conclusions: Guided ICBT for panic disorder is effective for both primary panic disorder symptoms and secondary depressive symptoms. Patients with high pre-treatment secondary depressive symptoms may constitute a vulnerable subgroup. A high level of panic disorder symptoms early in treatment seems beneficiary for depressive symptoms outcome. A time-dependent model may be necessary to describe the relationship between PAD symptoms and depressive symptoms during the course of treatment.",50
https://openalex.org/W3008016922,10.1002/smi.2935,Personal growth initiative and posttraumatic stress among survivors of transportation accidents: Mixture modeling indicating changes in group membership over time,"Abstract The current study explored subgroups in reported personal growth initiative (PGI) and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and examined the changes in class memberships among survivors of a transportation accident. Participants at Time 1 were 602 adults who reported directly experiencing a transportation accident within the past year ( M months = 6.36; SD months = 3.20). Of these participants, 171 adults completed the follow‐up survey after 3 months (Time 2). Finite mixture modeling was conducted to identify the heterogeneity of PTSS in relation with PGI at each time point. At Time 1, a four‐class model was the best‐fitting model, and at Time 2, a three‐class model was the best‐fitting model. As hypothesized, when examined cross‐sectionally, various subgroups were identified at each time point, finding subgroups with moderate to high levels of PGI but differing in their PTSS. However, when examining the longitudinal changes in class membership from Time 1 to Time 2, members of subgroups with higher PGI skills at Time 1 were more likely to be assigned to subgroups with lower PTSS at Time 2. The current study suggests a potential application of PGI skills in alleviating PTSS after a transportation accident and having a critical role in adjustment after hardship.",50

This study evaluates prospective associations of perceived unit cohesion with a range of mental health outcomes following combat deployment.U.S. Army soldiers were surveyed approximately 1-2 months before deployment to Afghanistan (T0); and 1 month (T1), 3 months (T2), and 9 months (T3) after return from deployment. Logistic regression was performed to estimate associations of perceived unit cohesion at T0 with risk of PTSD, major depressive episode (MDE), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), alcohol or substance use disorder (AUD/SUD), and suicidal ideation at T2 or T3 among soldiers who completed all study assessments (N = 4,645). Models were adjusted for sociodemographic and Army service characteristics, predeployment history of the index outcome, and deployment stress exposure.Higher perceived unit cohesion at T0 was associated with lower risk of PTSD, MDE, GAD, AUD/SUD, and suicidal ideation at T2 or T3 (AORs = 0.72 to 0.85 per standard score increase in unit cohesion; P-values < 0.05). Models of incidence of mental disorders and suicidal ideation among soldiers without these problems predeployment yielded similar results, except that perceived unit cohesion was not associated with incident AUD/SUD.Soldiers who reported strong unit cohesion before deployment had lower risk of postdeployment mental disorders and suicidal ideation. Awareness of associations of perceived unit cohesion with postdeployment mental health may facilitate targeting of prevention programs.",50

Epigenetic alterations in response to trauma have been identified as mechanism of adaptation and may therefore predict deployment-related PTSD symptoms. To date, human studies of epigenetic marks for traumatic stress have been largely constrained by short-term analyses of one or two time points.This study in a prospective Dutch military cohort (N ​= ​125) examined longitudinal changes of DNA methylation profiles before, as well as one and six months after deployment-related combat exposure in relation to the development of PTSD symptoms over a period of up to five years after deployment. We investigated the predictive value of specific methylation changes for immediate and delayed-onset PTSD symptoms and recovery. This epigenetic prediction was compared to polygenic risk score predictions obtained from the currently available largest genome-wide association study of PTSD.A total of fourteen genomic regions were identified in which PTSD symptom levels were associated with methylation changes over time (pre-deployment, one, and six months post-deployment). Of these regions, four were significant determinants of longitudinal development of PTSD symptoms. In addition, we observed that, together with risk level during deployment (operating inside or outside the military base) and physical childhood trauma, post-deployment decreases in methylation at a genomic region in EP300/miRNA1281 was associated with a delayed onset of PTSD compared to a resilient profile. Polygenic risk, in contrast, was related to PTSD onset within six months after deployment but was not associated with long term outcomes.The present study suggests predictive utility of changes in DNA methylation for the subsequent development of PTSD symptoms and showed that the currently available measure of polygenic risk is primarily related to non-delayed disease onset.",50

Researchers exploring the association between flood-exposure and psychopathology attempt to understand the conditions and mechanisms through which potential benefits may occur. One such potential factor that may contribute to resilience in the face of disaster is social support system. However, there is scarcity of researches concerning the protective effects of social support following floods, in adult samples. Thus, the present study examined the moderating and indirect effects of perceived social support from family and friends in the association between flood-exposure and symptoms of PTSD and depression. The study was a cross sectional in nature. Survey data were collected from 87 adult survivors of flood fury in Kashmir valley, aged 30–40. High level of family and friends’ support reduced the association between flood-exposure and symptoms of PTSD and depression whereas a low level of such support enhanced this association. Results also suggested that family support carried a significant proportion of variance in predicting depression. Given the potential for negative mental health outcomes following natural disasters, efforts to enhance adults’ social support may be especially important.",50

This is problematic as negative and unrealistic beliefs regarding parenthood and children may be a key mechanism by which PTSS increases vulnerability for adverse parenting outcomes. The aims of the study were to examine whether PTSS and the specific posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters were related to more negative parenting perceptions and to more unrealistic beliefs regarding children’s development among 212 trauma-exposed parents (Mage = 36.68 SD = 7.38; 60.9% female; 54.3% White). Higher levels of PTSS corresponded with more negative parenting perceptions and more unrealistic expectations of children. Intrusion, avoidance, and negative alterations in cognitions and mood were not associated with parenting perceptions. Trauma-related alterations in arousal and reactivity were related to more negative parenting-related beliefs regarding one’s child and oneself. PTSS, particularly trauma-related changes in arousal and reactivity symptoms, may be relevant in understanding perceptions of parenthood and beliefs regarding children’s development. These symptoms may be targeted via trauma-focused treatments to increase adaptive parenting outcomes for parents who have experienced trauma.",50

However, the impact of community-level socioeconomic disparities on recovery after burn injury is unknown. We aimed to characterize the association between community-level socioeconomic disparities and health-related quality of life (HRQL) after burn injury. These findings might inform rehabilitation service delivery and policy making at administrative levels. Methods Participants with the NIDILRR Burn Model System who were ≥14 years with a zip code were included. Sociodemographic and injury characteristics and 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and Veterans RAND (VR-12) physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores 6 months after injury were extracted. Data were deterministically linked by zip code to the Distressed Communities Index (DCI), which combines seven census-derived metrics into a single indicator of economic well-being that ranges from 0 (lowest distress) to 100 (highest distress). Multilevel linear regression models estimated the association between DCI and HRQL. Results The 342 participants were mostly male (239, 69%) had a median age of 48 years (IQR 33–57) and sustained a median burn size of 10% TBSA (IQR 3–28%). More than one-third of participants (117, 34%) lived in a neighborhood within the two most distressed quintiles. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and pre-injury HRQL, increasing neighborhood distress was negatively associated with PCS (ß-0.05, SE 0.02, p=0.01). Age and pre-injury PCS were also significantly associated with 6-month PCS. There was no association between neighborhood distress and 6-month MCS. However, pre-injury MCS was significantly associated with 6-month MCS (0.56, SE 0.07, p&amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions Neighborhood distress is associated with lower PCS after burn injury but is not associated with MCS. Regardless of neighborhood distress, pre-injury HRQL is significantly associated with both PCS and MCS during recovery.",50
https://openalex.org/W2805896075,10.1016/j.cpr.2018.05.008,Trajectories of resilience and dysfunction following potential trauma: A review and statistical evaluation,"Given the rapid proliferation of trajectory-based approaches to study clinical consequences to stress and potentially traumatic events (PTEs), there is a need to evaluate emerging findings. This review examined convergence/divergences across 54 studies in the nature and prevalence of response trajectories, and determined potential sources of bias to improve future research. Of the 67 cases that emerged from the 54 studies, the most consistently observed trajectories following PTEs were resilience (observed in: n = 63 cases), recovery (n = 49), chronic (n = 47), and delayed onset (n = 22). The resilience trajectory was the modal response across studies (average of 65.7% across populations, 95% CI [0.616, 0.698]), followed in prevalence by recovery (20.8% [0.162, 0.258]), chronicity (10.6%, [0.086, 0.127]), and delayed onset (8.9% [0.053, 0.133]). Sources of heterogeneity in estimates primarily resulted from substantive population differences rather than bias, which was observed when prospective data is lacking. Overall, prototypical trajectories have been identified across independent studies in relatively consistent proportions, with resilience being the modal response to adversity. Thus, trajectory models robustly identify clinically relevant patterns of response to potential trauma, and are important for studying determinants, consequences, and modifiers of course following potential trauma.",50

A number of early psychological interventions have been developed to try to prevent chronic difficulties. Objective: The objective of this study was to establish the current evidence for the effectiveness of multiple session early psychological interventions aimed at preventing or treating traumatic stress symptoms beginning within three months of trauma exposure. Methods: Randomized controlled trials of early multiple session psychological interventions aimed at preventing or reducing traumatic stress symptoms of individuals exposed to a traumatic event, fulfiling trauma criteria for an ICD or DSM diagnosis of PTSD were identified through a search of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Clinical Trials Registers database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and PILOTS. Two authors independently extracted study details and data and completed risk of bias assessments. Analyses were undertaken using Review Manager software. Quality of findings were rated according to 'Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation' (GRADE) and appraised for clinical importance. Results: Sixty-one studies evaluating a variety of interventions were identified. For individuals exposed to a trauma who were not pre-screened for traumatic stress symptoms there were no clinically important differences between any intervention and usual care. For individuals reporting traumatic stress symptoms we found clinically important evidence of benefits for trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT-T), cognitive therapy without exposure and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). Differences were greatest for those diagnosed with acute stress disorder (ASD) and PTSD. Conclusions: There is evidence for the effectiveness of several early psychological interventions for individuals with traumatic stress symptoms following trauma exposure, especially for those meeting the diagnostic threshold for ASD or PTSD. Evidence is strongest for trauma-focused CBT.Antecedentes: El Trastorno de Estrés Postraumático (TEPT) es un trastorno frecuente y debilitante que tiene un impacto significativo en las vidas de los que lo padecen. Se han desarrollado una serie de intervenciones psicológicas tempranas para tratar de prevenir dificultades crónicas.Objetivo: El objetivo de este estudio fue establecer la evidencia actual para la eficacia de intervenciones psicológicas tempranas con múltiples sesiones con el objetivo de prevenir o tratar síntomas de estrés traumático que comenzaron en los tres meses posteriores a la exposición al trauma.Métodos: Se realizó una búsqueda bibliográfica basada en la base de datos de Cochrane de Estudios Clínicos de Trastornos Mentales Frecuentes, en el registro de ensayos controlados de Cochrane, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO y PILOTS, para identificar ensayos controlados randomizados de intervenciones psicológicas tempranas de múltiples sesiones que tenían el objetivo de prevenir o reducir síntomas de estrés traumático en individuos expuestos a un evento traumático, y que cumplían los criterios de TEPT según la CIE o el DSM. Dos autores independientes extrajeron los detalles e información del estudio y completaron una evaluación de riesgo de sesgo. Se llevaron a cabo análisis usando el software Review Manager. La calidad de los hallazgos fue puntuada según los ‘Grados de Recomendación, Valoración, Desarrollo y Evaluación’ (GRADE pos sus siglas en inglés) y evaluada por su importancia clínica.Resultados: Se identificaron sesenta y un estudios que evaluaban una variedad de intervenciones. Para aquellos individuos que estuvieron expuestos a un trauma que no tuvieron una pre-evaluación de síntomas de estrés traumático no hubo una diferencia clínica importante entre cualquier intervención y cuidado usual. Para los individuos que reportaron síntomas de estrés traumático encontramos evidencia clínicamente significativa de los beneficios de la terapia cognitiva focalizada en el trauma (CBT-T por sus siglas en inglés), terapia cognitiva sin exposición y desensibilización y reprocesamiento a través de movimientos oculares (EMDR por sus siglas en inglés). Las diferencias fueron mayores para aquellos diagnosticados con trastornos de estrés agudo (ASD por sus siglas en inglés) y TEPT.Conclusiones: Existe evidencia para la eficacia de varias intervenciones psicológicas tempranas para individuos con síntomas de estrés traumático posterior a la exposición a un trauma, especialmente para aquellos que cumplen con los criterios para un diagnóstico completo de ASD o TEPT. La evidencia es más fuerte para la CBT-T.背景：创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）是一种常见的, 使人衰弱的疾病，对患者的生活有重大影响。为预防发展为慢性疾病，已经开发出许多早期心理干预措施。目标：本研究的目的是为旨在预防或治疗创伤暴露三个月内开始出现的创伤应激症状的多阶段早期心理干预的有效性建立现有证据。方法：通过搜索Cochrane常见精神障碍小组临床试验注册数据库, Cochrane 临床对照试验数据库, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO 和 PILOTS，确定了早期多阶段心理干预的随机对照试验。这些干预旨在预防或减轻遭受创伤事件且符合 ICD 或 DSM 诊断 PTSD 的创伤标准的个体的创伤应激症状。两位作者分别独自提取了研究细节和数据，并完成了误差风险评估。使用 Review Manager 软件进行分析。根据‘推荐分级的评估, 制定与评价’（GRADE）对结果的质量进行评级并评估其临床重要性。结果：确定了评估多种干预措施的61项研究。对于有创伤暴露但未预先筛查创伤应激症状的个体，任何干预措施和日常护理间均无重要的临床差异。对于报告有创伤应激症状者，我们发现聚焦创伤的认知行为疗法（CBT-T）, 无暴露认知疗法以及眼动脱敏与再加工（EMDR）效益的重要临床证据。在被诊断为急性应激障碍（ASD）和 PTSD 的患者中差异最大。结论：有证据表明了对于创伤暴露后患有创伤应激症状者，特别是那些达到 ASD 或 PTSD 诊断阈值的个体，几种早期心理干预的有效性。对于聚焦创伤的 CBT 证据最充分。.",51

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Level-1 trauma center. Patients: Children (8 to 18), undergoing surgery for orthopaedic trauma. Intervention: Upper and lower extremity surgery for orthopaedic trauma. Main outcome measurements: PTSD symptoms at postoperative follow-up as determined by the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS). Results: A total of 176 children with an average age at surgery of 13 years (8 to 18.8 years) participated in the study. Twenty-six subjects had high levels of PTSD symptoms (15%; 95% CI = 10.0 to 21.1%). Univariable and multivariable analyses determined that female sex (OR 2.63, 95% CI = 1.06 to 6.67, P = 0.04), older age at surgery (OR 1.25, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.51, P = 0.02), and undergoing a previous surgery (OR 2.86, 95% CI = 1.06 to 7.73, P = 0.04) were all associated with increased PTSD risk. Conclusions: Children and adolescents experience a high level of PTSD symptoms (15%) after surgery for orthopaedic trauma. Clinicians should be aware of PTSD symptoms in children and adolescents after surgery for orthopaedic injuries and use comprehensive screening to facilitate timely intervention and treatment.

Most people who experience such events recover from them, but people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) continue to be severely depressed and anxious for months or even years following the event. Palestinians are especially at a higher risk for developing anxiety disorders and PTSD due to their chronic exposure to political violence, prolonged displacement, and others as a limited professional, educational, financial opportunities, and mental health services. This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the literature and established studies concerning Anxiety disorders besides PTSD in Palestine.Methods PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar was used to search for materials, for the critical analysis of empirical articles, the following aspects were considered: study type, sample, and the key findings. Results Twenty-four studies from Palestine (West Bank and Gaza) were included in this review. Five studies related to children, five related to Adolescent, three related to women, three related to physical diseased and four related to gender and age differences.Results showed that anxiety disorders and PTSD were one of the most common mental disorders in Palestine. Anxiety and PTSD develop from a complex set of risk factors, including genetics, personality, and life events. They are highly associated with poor quality of life and disability. The results indicate that a significant proportion of Palestinian experiencing serious psychological distress especially anxiety and PTSD. Therefore, a mental health policy for Palestinians must deal with several challenges. Distinct barriers including inconsistent availability of medications, absence of multidisciplinary teamwork, insufficient specialists, fragmented mental health system, and occupation need to be addressed.Conclusion As a primary prevention, the occupation should be considered as a main source of the anxiety and other mental health disorders in Palestine. Besides, there is a need to implement mental health care system through the multidisciplinary work and raising awareness regarding prevalent of mental disorders.",51

Growth mixture modeling was used to assess profiles of early victimization during adolescence (14–17 years). Discrete time survival mixture analysis was used to assess time to treatment entry and substance use disorder diagnosis. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) were used as predictors of survival time. Mixture models revealed three profiles of victimization: sustained poly-victimization, moderate/decreasing victimization, and low victimization. Youth in the sustained poly-victimization class were more likely to enter treatment earlier and have a substance use diagnosis earlier than other classes. PTSD was a significant predictor of treatment entry for youth in the sustained poly-victimization class, and MDD was a significant predictor of substance use disorder diagnosis for youth in the moderate/decreasing victimization class. Therefore, substance use prevention programming targeted at youth experiencing poly-victimization in early adolescence—especially those who have PTSD or MDD—is needed.",51

The DSM-5 clarified PTSD Criterion A to delineate direct and indirect trauma exposures, but effects on the conditional probability of PTSD and functional impairment remain unknown. The objectives of this study were to provide contemporary estimates of PTSD prevalence and conditional probabilities in the US military veteran population, determine the likelihood of developing PTSD following direct versus indirect exposures to potentially traumatic events (PTEs), and examine the effects of direct and indirect PTEs and PTSD on functional impairment.Methods: Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS), an online survey of a nationally representative sample of US military veterans conducted from November 2019 to March 2020 (median completion date: November 21, 2019). Trauma exposures were assessed with the Life Events Checklist-5 and PTSD with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5.Results: The weighted prevalence of lifetime PTSD was 9.4% (95% CI, 8.5%-10.3%) and of past-month PTSD was 5.0% (95% CI, 4.3%-5.7%). Direct PTEs were associated with increased odds of lifetime (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.30-1.42) and past-month PTSD (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.31-1.46), but indirect PTEs were not (lifetime OR = 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.03; past-month OR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97-1.00). Both PTSD (unstandardized B = 6.11, SE = 0.35) and direct PTEs (unstandardized B = 0.13, SE = 0.04), but not indirect PTEs, were significantly associated with functional impairment after adjustment for demographic and psychiatric variables.Conclusions: The prevalence of lifetime PTSD in US military veterans (9.4%) is slightly higher than 2016 estimates (6.9%-8.1%). Direct and indirect PTEs are prevalent in US military veterans, with only direct PTEs associated with higher conditional probability of past-month PTSD and greater functional impairment.",51

Married families (N = 293) with at least one child between the ages of 4 and 12 were recruited from a Midwestern state. Service members were from the Reserve Component (National Guard or Reserves); fathers (N = 253) and/or mothers had deployed (N = 45) to the recent conflicts in the Middle East. Multiple-method (observations of parenting and couple interactions; questionnaires) and multiple informant measures were gathered online and in the homes of participants, from parents, children, and teachers. Findings demonstrated associations between mothers' and fathers' PTSD symptoms and a latent variable of child adjustment comprising teacher, parent, and child report. Mothers' but not fathers' PTSD symptoms were also associated with dyadic adjustment and parenting practices; parenting practices were in turn associated with child adjustment. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for military family stress research and interventions to support and strengthen parents and families after deployment.",51

Longitudinal studies in developing countries are scarce. Particularly, Argentina had one of the longest lockdowns. Differences in preventive measures against the virus spread between countries may differentially affect the mental health of the populations. Here we aimed to characterize distinct psychological-distress and related-symptoms trajectories associated with the pandemic and explore risk/protective factors. In this longitudinal study, data from 832 Argentineans were collected every 3-5 months, between April 2020-August 2021. Mean psychological-distress levels and related-symptoms tended to increase over time. However, latent-class analysis identified four distinct psychological-distress trajectories. Most individuals had consistently good mental health (Resilient). Two classes showed psychological-distress worsening during the initial phase of the pandemic and recovered at different time points (Fast Recovery; Slow Recovery). The remaining class maintained a mild -level of psychological-distress and began to deteriorate in March 2021 (Deteriorating) continuously. Individuals who are younger, female, have pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses, or have high neuroticism or lower resilience were more likely to experiencing fluctuations in psychological-distress. The mental health trajectory during the pandemic had a complex dynamic. Although most participants remained resilient, a vulnerable group was detected, which deteriorated over time and should be considered by health-services.",51
https://openalex.org/W2913042601,10.1002/jts.22368,Addressing Disaster Exposure Measurement Issues With Latent Class Analysis,"Abstract Disaster exposure can put survivors at greater risk for subsequent mental health (MH) problems. Within the field of disaster MH research, it is important to understand how the choice of analytic approaches and their implicit assumptions may affect results when using a disaster exposure measure. We compared different analytic strategies for quantifying disaster exposure and included a new analytic approach, latent class analysis (LCA), in a sample of parents and youth. Following exposure to multiple floods in Texas, a sample of 555 parents and 486 youth were recruited. Parents were predominantly female (70.9%) and White (60.8%). Parents were asked to have their oldest child between the ages of 10 and 19 years old participate ( M = 13.74 years, SD = 2.57; 52.9% male). Participants completed measures on disaster exposure, posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety. The LCA revealed four patterns of exposure in both parents and youth: high exposure (15.5% parent, 9.5% child), moderate exposure (19.8% parent, 28.2% child), community exposure (45.9% parent, 34.4% child), and low exposure (18.8% parent, 27.8% child). In terms of MH, there were similarities across analytic approaches, but the LCA highlighted a threshold effect, with the high exposure class doing worse than all others, d = 1.12. These results have important implications in understanding the different exposure experiences of survivors and the linkage to MH outcomes. The findings are also informative in the development and use of screening tools used in postdisaster contexts in determining who may or may not need MH services.",51

However, conceptual efforts to delineate the effects of childhood abuse on treatment trajectories for traumatized military veterans are lacking. This study compared trauma and psychological symptom profiles for developmentally abused and non-abused Canadian Forces (CF) veterans (N = 108) diagnosed with operational PTSD. Subscale scores from the Detailed Assessment of PTSD Scale (DAPS) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) were submitted to MANOVA. The analysis resulted in a composite variable reflecting’ symptom suppression efforts’ that separated abused veterans (n = 55) from non-abused veterans (n = 53). Post hoc analyses showed significant differences between the abused sub-groups (i.e., physical and sexual abuse [n = 15]; physical abuse only [n = 17]; sexual abuse only [n = 23]) and the non-abused group. Veterans with abuse histories had higher symptom suppression scores, reflecting higher levels of substance abuse, post-traumatic dissociation, interpersonal mistrust, as well as, lower depression and PTSD impairment scores. Implications for clinicians and an alternative intervention for treating traumatized military personnel with histories of developmental abuse are discussed.",51

A previous study showed that CSE affects subsequent PTSS levels, but not vice versa among a sample exposed 0–6 months ago. In this four-wave follow-up study we examined the cross-lagged relationships between CSE and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among those exposed to PTEs (potentially traumatic events) 1–2 years before T1 in order to examine direction of influence. Research questions were: 1) what are the cross-lagged associations between CSE and PTSS levels among those exposed to PTE in the relatively long-term (1–2 years ago, called PTE long-term group), and 2) to what extent do these associations differ from the cross lagged associations among those exposed to PTE in the relatively short-term (0–6 months ago)? Study samples consist of adult respondents of a representative internet panel who experienced a PTE between 1 and 2 years before T1, and did not experience any new PTE between T1 and T3 (long-term group, N = 438) and those exposed in the six months before T1, and not exposed to any additional PTE (short-term group, N = 400). Levels of CSE and PTSS were measured with 4-month intervals. In addition, prospectively assessed personality traits and peritraumatic distress were entered in the analyses. Structural equation modeling showed that CSE perceptions will continue to influence subsequent PTSS levels in the long-term, just as they did in the short-term. Contrary to the more short-term post-exposure period however, CSE levels do not just influence recovery from PTSS. Over time, degree of PTSS experienced also influences subsequent CSE perceptions. Results suggest that while trauma-related CSE perceptions are relatively robust in the short-term recovery period, they can be affected by posttraumatic stress in the long-term.",51

The mediating role of rumination processes,"The aim of this study was to test a cognitive model of posttraumatic symptoms (PTS) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) after exposure to a natural disaster. It was hypothesized that although subjective severity of trauma would be related to the severity of PTS, this relation would be mediated by brooding and cognitive strategies related to the presence of repetitive negative content in thoughts. Furthermore, the relation between severity and PTG would be fully mediated by deliberate rumination (DR), cognitive strategies related to conscious efforts focused on handling the event. To evaluate the cognitive model, adults (N=351) who lost their homes as a result of the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Chile on February 27, 2010, were selected. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The resulting model had adequate indices of goodness adjustment and showed that brooding completely mediated the relation between subjective severity and PTS, and DR completely mediated the relation between subjective severity, brooding, and PTG. These results highlight the role of both the content and process of rumination in mediating the association between subjective severity of trauma, PTS, and PTG. The implications of these results for a more comprehensive model of symptom severity that occurs after trauma are discussed.",51

Depression and suicidal ideation were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Self-reported suicide attempts during the past year were recorded at each follow-up examination, at 1, 2, 3, 10, 15 and 20 years post-injury.Results: Throughout the 20 years of follow-up, rates of depression ranged from 24.8–28.1%, suicidal ideation ranged from 7.0–10.1% and suicide attempts (past year) ranged from 0.8–1.7%. Participants who endorsed depression and/or suicidal behaviour at year 1 demonstrated consistently elevated rates of depression and suicidal behaviour 5 years after TBI.Conclusion: Compared to the general population, individuals with TBI are at greater risk for depression and suicidal behaviour many years after TBI. The significant psychiatric symptoms evidenced by individuals with TBI highlight the need for routine screening and mental health treatment in this population.",51

Within the model, bivariate correlations among variables were all significant within each time point. Between years 1 and 2 and between years 2 and 5, depressive symptoms had a larger effect on SI than SI had on depressive symptoms. Between years 5 and 10, there was reciprocal causality between the 2 variables. Functional independence more strongly predicted depressive symptoms than the reverse between years 1 and 2 as well as years 2 and 5, but its unique effects on SI over time were extremely marginal or absent after controlling for depressive symptoms.A primary goal for rehabilitation and mental health providers should be to monitor and address elevated symptoms of depression as quickly as possible before they translate into SI, particularly for individuals with TBI who have reduced functional independence.

Forecasting the Course of Post-Traumatic Stress Following Emergency Room Admission: A Machine Learning Approach,"Previous studies identified distinct trajectories of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. These studies typically focus on sociodemographic information and severity of potential traumatic brain injury. Moreover, they often investigate these potential predictive factors a long time after the traumatic event took place, thereby limiting the possibility to discern what is a risk factor and what is the consequence of the psychopathology. Thus, there is need to include data comprehensively and to do so immediately after the potentially traumatic event. We examined a broad range of variables in n=338 patients after Emergency Room admission after having experienced a traumatic event. The current work utilizes machine learning to predict post-traumatic stress responses based on biological indicators garnered from electronic medical records including immune markers, heart rate, pulse, along with inter-related endocrine and genetic markers.",52

However, there has been little systematic investigation of the association of anger with psychopathology or other individual characteristics in disaster survivors. This study examined anger responses reported by disaster survivors and correlates of that anger.Structured interviews were conducted with a volunteer sample of 379 employees of 7 agencies that were highly affected by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. Individuals were asked about their level of anger toward various entities and their coping methods after the disaster. Assessments were made for disaster-related posttraumatic stress disorder and other psychiatric disorders using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV. Specifics of disaster trauma exposure were assessed using the Disaster Supplement.Anger was prevalent but was not associated with disaster trauma exposure. Anger was generally associated with lower level of education, younger age, and racial minority group membership, and was more prominent in survivors with indicators of post-disaster mental health problems.Anger may serve as an identifier of individuals at risk for psychopathology or who are at least highly distressed. There are potential implications for risk communication to address anger in the post-disaster setting.",52
https://openalex.org/W2798184409,10.1093/jbcr/irz014,The Impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences on Burn Outcomes in Adult Burn Patients,"Abstract Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), including child maltreatment and household dysfunction, define adverse events that occur before 18 years of age. National and state data show that between 12.5 and 14.5% of the adult population report ≥4 ACEs (HIGH-ACE), respectively. HIGH-ACEs are associated with more chronic health problems. To date, the interaction between ACEs and burn injuries has not been studied. Herein, we sought to define the ACE exposure in our burn patients and its impact on early outcomes. Inpatient and outpatient adult burn survivors (≥18 years of age) were enrolled. Subjects completed surveys assessing adverse experiences (ACEs-18), needs, strengths, and resiliency at consent, and pain, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social participation surveys at 2 weeks to 3 months postinjury. Demographics, burn, and hospital course data were also collected. Chi-square and student’s t-tests were used for descriptive analysis and to compare the groups (HIGH-ACE vs LOW-ACE). The HIGH-ACE group (n = 24; 45.3%) reported more depressive symptoms (P &amp;lt; .04) than the LOW-ACE group (n = 29, 54.7%). HIGH-ACE patients were less resilient when facing stressful events (P ≤ .02) and more likely to screen positive for probable PTSD (P = .01) and to score lower on the Life Impact Burn Recovery Evaluation Profile (LIBRE Profile), which assesses for social participation, in the domain of Family and Friends (P = .015). Our exploratory study suggests that ACE screening may help detect burn patients at risk for a more complicated recovery, thereby promoting personalized assistance in recovery.",52
https://openalex.org/W2905601050,10.1037/adb0000430,Dynamic changes in marines’ reports of PTSD symptoms and problem alcohol use across the deployment cycle.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol misuse are commonly co-occurring problems in active-duty service members (SMs) and veterans. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the temporal associations between these problems in the acute period following exposure to combat stressors. Discerning the temporal associations between these problems across the deployment cycle could inform prevention and treatment efforts. In this study, we examined the association between PTSD symptom severity and problem alcohol use in a large cohort of United States Marines (n = 758) evaluated prior to deployment and approximately 1, 5, and 8 months postdeployment. Results indicate that problem alcohol use was associated with a subsequent exacerbation of PTSD symptoms between the 1st and 2nd and 2nd and 3rd postdeployment assessments. PTSD symptom severity was associated with increased problem alcohol use between the 1st and 2nd postdeployment assessments. These findings suggest that problem drinking may lead to new onset or worsening of PTSD symptoms over time and that SMs with greater PTSD symptom severity upon returning from deployment may increase alcohol use in the weeks immediately following homecoming.

Perceived quality of neighborhood green space was measured using a scale adapted from the Neighborhood Open Space (NOS) scale, and concentration of greenness was measured objectively using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Probable PTSD was measured using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and hurricane-related distress using the Impact of Event Scale (IES-R). Generalized linear mixed models were used to fit individual models. Based on the results, structural equation models were employed to test direct and indirect pathways simultaneously. Models were adjusted for neighborhood- and individual-level confounders.Greater perceived quality of neighborhood green space was significantly associated with lower likelihoods of probable PTSD and hurricane-related distress. The effects of perceived green space quality on hurricane-related distress were mediated by higher levels of emotional resilience. Social cohesion, although significantly correlated with PTSD and distress, did not mediate the effect of perceived green space quality on either. Neighborhood NDVI was significantly associated with hurricane-related distress, but not with PTSD.We conclude that living in neighborhoods with greater perceived quality of green space was associated with lower levels of post-hurricane distress, with mediation especially through the emotional resilience pathway. These findings suggest that in disaster recovery policy frameworks, more attention should be paid to the benefits of high-quality neighborhood green infrastructure.",52

In this article, we first consider the dominant psychological approach to disasters and its narrow focus on psychopathology (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder). We then review research on a broader approach that has identified heterogeneous, highly replicable trajectories of outcome, the most common being stable mental health or resilience. We review trajectory research for different types of disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, we consider correlates of the resilience trajectory and note their paradoxically limited ability to predict future resilient outcomes. Research using machine learning algorithms improved prediction but has not yet illuminated the mechanism behind resilient adaptation. To that end, we propose a more direct psychological explanation for resilience based on research on the motivational and mechanistic components of regulatory flexibility. Finally, we consider how future research might leverage new computational approaches to better capture regulatory flexibility in real time.

To develop such methods, factors that contribute to children's vulnerability and key signs of distress reactions after disasters need to be understood. To address these issues, we evaluated pre-disaster community violence exposure as a vulnerability factor for children's post-disaster reactions and somatic symptoms as a key post-disaster outcome. We evaluated 426 children exposed to Hurricane Katrina at two timepoints (3–7 months and 13–17 months post-disaster). Structural equation models evaluated community violence exposure, hurricane exposure, and posttraumatic stress and somatic symptoms. Community violence exposure was associated with increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms among disaster-impacted youth, and did not moderate the relationship between disaster exposure and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with somatic symptoms in the short-term recovery period (3–7 months), but not associated with somatic symptoms during the longer-term recovery period (13–17 months). This study did not include school-level factors, and somatic symptoms were based on parent reports. The study did not include parent functioning information or distinguish between whether somatic symptoms were medical or functional in nature. Post-disaster school-based screeners may need to incorporate questions related to children's past exposure to community violence and their somatic symptoms to provide trauma-informed care for children.",52

The Syrian crisis is 8 years old and yet little is known about the impact of the conflict on the well-being of Syrians who remain. This gap was addressed by conducting an empirical study on the mental health burden of Syrian children in two areas of the country.492 children between 8 and 15 years were randomly selected from schools in Damascus and Latakia. The incidence of psychological disorder symptoms was measured using self-report screening instruments, the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-8) and the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS-25). Simultaneously, sociodemographic and traumatic event information was collected. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors that influence the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.In our sample, 50.2% of students were internally displaced and 32.1% reported a negative experience. 60.5% of those tested had at least one probable psychological disorder with PTSD the most common (35.1%), followed by depression (32.0%), and anxiety (29.5%). Binary logistic regression indicated that PTSD symptoms were predicted by: living in Damascus [odds ratio (OR) 2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51-3.69], being female (1.54, 1.02-2.34), having depression and anxiety (2.55, 1.48-4.40), and the negative experiences; displacement and daily warzone exposure (1.84, 1.02-3.30 and 2.67, 1.08-6.60).Syrian children are experiencing traumatic events and war-associated daily stresses that are hugely impacting psychological well-being.

We document the long-term consequences for population health of exposure to an extreme event, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, which killed an estimated quarter of a million people worldwide. Using data from an extremely rich population-representative longitudinal survey, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR), we explore how this major natural disaster affected survival and psychosocial health of adults in the 15 years after the tsunami. Leveraging the unanticipated nature of the tsunami, contrasts between those who were directly affected by the disaster and those who were not can plausibly be interpreted as causal. We also investigate the impacts of specific exposures and stressors. Results for mortality and post-traumatic stress reactivity establish that a large-scale natural disaster exerts enduring impacts on health and well-being. In communities that were directly affected by the tsunami, survivors are positively selected with respect to characteristics associated with longevity. For some, this advantage dissipates over time as the deleterious effects of their experiences during the tsunami and in its aftermath emerge over the long term, both in terms of subsequent survival rates and psychosocial health.",53

Research in police and nontraditional responders suggests that PTSD mediates the relationship between 9/11 physical exposures and LRS, but not vice versa. We replicated these findings in WTC rescue/recovery workers (R/R workers), extended them to exposed community members, and explored the interplay between both physical and psychological 9/11 exposures, probable PTSD, and LRS over a 10-year follow-up. Methods Participants were 12,398 R/R workers and 12,745 community members assessed in three WTC Health Registry surveys (2003–2004, 2006–2007, and 2011–2012). LRS and 9/11 exposures were self-reported. Probable PTSD was defined as a PTSD Checklist score ≥44. Results Probable PTSD predicted LRS (R/R workers: β = 0.88–0.98, p &lt; .001; community members: β = 0.67–0.86, p &lt; .001) and LRS predicted PTSD (R/R workers: β = 0.83–0.91, p &lt; .001; community members: β = 0.68–0.75, p &lt; .001) at follow-ups, adjusting for prior symptoms and covariates. In both R/R workers and community members, probable PTSD mediated the relationship between 9/11 physical exposures (dust cloud, long duration of work) and LRS (indirect effects, p = .001–.006), and LRS mediated the physical exposure-PTSD relationship (indirect effects, p = .001–.006). In R/R workers, probable PTSD mediated the psychological exposure (losing friends or loved ones, witnessing horrific events)–LRS relationship (indirect effect, p &lt; .001), but LRS did not mediate the psychological exposure-PTSD relationship (indirect effect, p = .332). In community members, high 9/11 psychological exposure predicted both probable PTSD and LRS at follow-ups; probable PTSD mediated the psychological exposure-LRS relationship (indirect effect, p &lt; .001), and LRS mediated the psychological exposure-PTSD relationship (indirect effect, p = .001). Conclusions Probable PTSD and LRS each mediated the other, with subtle differences between R/R workers and community members. A diagnosis of either should trigger assessment for the other; treatment should be carefully coordinated.",53

However, less is known about the factors that might mitigate the effects of loneliness on mental health outcomes such as depression. We propose that resilience resources may serve as potential protective factors that buffer the impact of loneliness on depressive symptoms. This study aimed to (a) test the effects of loneliness, as well as resilience factors of perceived family support and optimism, on depressive symptoms, and (b) examine resilience factors as moderators of the relationship between loneliness and depressive symptoms. Participants derived from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative sample of the population aged 50 years and older. The analytic sample was selected with baseline measurements in either 2006 or 2008 and two follow-ups across four-year intervals (N= 7,336). Structural equation modeling with latent variables and interaction terms was used to investigate study aims. Results revealed that (a) loneliness was significantly related to an increase in depressive symptoms; both perceived family support and optimism significantly reduced depressive symptoms, and (b) the link between loneliness and depressive symptoms was weaker when older adults reported higher levels of perceived family support and greater optimism. This study highlights the important protective roles played by perceived family support and optimism in reducing the adverse impact of loneliness on depression. Results suggest that strengthening family support and fostering optimism might be promising avenues for improving mental health in older adults particularly among those experiencing loneliness.",53

Latent transition analysis of pain Numeric Rating Scale, SF-12, and EQ-5D-3L pain and mental health items from 6 to 12 months, and 12 to 24 months post-injury were used to identify symptom transitions.Four transition groups were identified: transition to low problems by 12-months; transition to low problems at 24-months; stable low problems; and no transition from problems. Group-based trajectory modelling of pain and mental health treatments found three treatment trajectories: low/no treatment, a moderate treatment that declined to low treatment 3-12 months post-injury, and increasing treatment over time. Predictors of pain and mental health recovery transitions, identified using multinomial logistic regression, were primarily found to be non-modifiable socioeconomic and health-related characteristics (e.g., higher education, working pre-injury, and not having comorbidities), and low treatment trajectories.Targeted and collaborative rehabilitation should be considered for people at risk of persistent pain or mental health symptoms to optimise their recovery, particularly patients with socioeconomic disadvantage.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTwo-thirds of people experience pain and/or mental health within the first 24-months after hospitalization for road trauma, of whom only 6-7% recover by 12-months, and a further 6% recover by 24-months post-injury.There were three main trajectories of administrative records of treatments received in the first two years after injury: 76 and 83% had low treatment, 18 and 12% had moderate then declining treatment levels, and 6 and 5% had stable high treatment for pain or mental health, respectively.People who recovered from pain or mental health symptoms generally had lower treatment and higher socioeconomic position, highlighting that coordinated rehabilitation care should be prioritized for people living with socioeconomic disadvantage.",53

The course of recovery can be highly variable. This study investigates whether deployment-acquired mTBI is associated with subsequent presence and severity of post-concussive symptoms (PCS) and identifies predictors of persistent PCS among US Army personnel who sustained mTBI while deployed to Afghanistan. We used data from a prospective longitudinal survey of soldiers assessed 1-2 months before a 10-month deployment to Afghanistan (T0), on redeployment to the United States (T1), approximately 3 months later (T2), and approximately 9 months later (T3). Outcomes of interest were PCS at T2 and T3. Predictors considered were: sociodemographic factors, number of previous deployments, pre-deployment mental health and TBI history, and mTBI and other military-related stress during the index deployment. The study sample comprised 4518 soldiers, 822 (18.2%) of whom experienced mTBI during the index deployment. After adjusting for demographic, clinical, and deployment-related factors, deployment-acquired mTBI was associated with nearly triple the risk of reporting any PCS and with increased severity of PCS when symptoms were present. Among those who sustained mTBI, severity of PCS at follow-up was associated with history of pre-deployment TBI(s), pre-deployment psychological distress, more severe deployment stress, and loss of consciousness or lapse of memory (versus being ""dazed"" only) as a result of deployment-acquired mTBI. In summary, we found that sustaining mTBI increases risk for persistent PCS. Previous TBI(s), pre-deployment psychological distress, severe deployment stress, and loss of consciousness or lapse of memory resulting from mTBI(s) are prognostic indicators of persistent PCS after an index mTBI. These observations may have actionable implications for prevention of chronic sequelae of mTBI in the military and other settings.",53

These symptoms can have long-term adverse impacts on parent mental health, family functioning, and the adjustment of the ill child. Independent studies have found such reactions in several different illness groups. However, very little research has systematically compared the prevalence, impact and trajectories over time of post-traumatic stress symptoms in parents across different childhood illness groups with an acute life threat. The current study seeks to map the course of post-traumatic stress reactions in parents of children with various life threatening illnesses over an 18 month period, and identify factors that predict successful adaptation in families. The current study described is of a prospective, longitudinal design. The sample included parents of children admitted to four major hospital departments at the Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, for a life threatening illness or injury. Eligible parents were those who were caregivers of children aged 0-to 18-years admitted to the Oncology, Cardiology, Neurology and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Parents were recruited acutely, and completed self-report questionnaires at four time-points: within the first 4 weeks (T1:); then at 4 months (T2); 7 months (T3); and 19 months (T4) after admission. Questionnaires assessed parent and child mental health and wellbeing, and a number of risk and reliance factors such child illness factors, parent demographic factors, and psychosocial factors. This study is one of the first to document the trajectory of post-traumatic stress responses in parents of very ill children, across illness groups. Given that it will also identify risk and resilience factors, and map the course of parent outcomes over an 18 monthperiod, it has the potential to inform novel strategies for intervention.",53

Modeling of symptom growth trajectories facilitates understanding predictors of individual outcomes over time. Although growth mixture modeling (GMM) has been applied to military populations, few studies have incorporated both pre-deployment and follow-up measurements over an extended time. Methods In this prospective study, 1087 US Army soldiers with varying military occupational specialties and geographic locations were assessed before and after deployment to the Iraq War, with long-term follow-up assessment occurring at least five years after return from deployment. The primary outcome variable was the PTSD Checklist, civilian version, summary score. Results GMM yielded four latent profiles: (1) primarily asymptomatic (n = 194; 17·8%), (2) post-deployment worsening symptoms (n = 84; 7·7%), (3) mild symptoms (n = 320; 29·4%), and (4) pre-existing, with chronic post-deployment elevation of symptoms (n = 489; 45·0%). Regression models comparing the primarily asymptomatic class to symptomatic classes revealed that chronic symptom classes were associated with greater stress exposure, less pre-deployment social support, identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, military reservist or veteran status at most recent assessment, and poorer pre-deployment visual memory. Conclusions PTSD symptom course varies considerably over time after military deployment and is associated with potentially modifiable biopsychosocial factors occurring early in its course, in addition to exposures and military status.

Methods In April 2012 our hospital was designated as a major trauma centre receiving patients from across the region with major trauma including head injury. Since this time 169 paediatric trauma patients have been admitted, including 66 traumatic brain injuries (TBI). All paediatric TBI patients are offered a review at 6–8 weeks post discharge in the neurology nurse outpatient clinic. Results Data were collected on 58 patients (39 male) who were admitted during April 2012-June 2014 as major trauma with mild (n=27), moderate (n=19) and severe (n=11) TBI. Patients were aged 15 months–7 years (median age 9.5 years). Patients had a total length of stay of 1–224 days (median 5 days). 34 patients were admitted to PICU and 23 received neurosurgery. Patients <3 years old or those admitted for long term rehabilitation and not returning to their own school are excluded from this review (n=9). To date 7 patients have failed to attend and 34 patients have attended out-patient review, median time to review was 12 weeks (range 6 weeks – 1 year). 20 (59%) patients had neuro cognitive symptoms at time of last follow-up, these include reduced concentration (n=9), poor memory (n=9), headache (n=8), fatigue (n=6) emotional lability (n=5), anxiety (n=4), sleep disturbance (n=3) and anger outbursts (n=1). No symptoms were expressed by 14 patients. Conclusion Neurocognitive symptoms are commonly present in early follow-up. Further assessment and longitudinal follow up is required to establish duration and severity of these cognitive symptoms. Neurocognitive testing at 6 months post TBI would also further define the nature of these difficulties and direct cognitive rehabilitation and school support.

Changes in the six most common physical symptoms and the most common psychological symptom were evaluated using multilevel growth mixture modeling. Age, gender, comorbidity, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy were included as covariates in the conditional models for symptom occurrence and severity.The total number of symptoms increased significantly from the preoperative to the one month assessment. At five months, the number of symptoms was lower than at one month but significantly higher than at the preoperative assessment. The occurrence of five of the symptoms (i.e., pain, lack of energy, shortness of breath, feeling drowsy, and worrying) increased significantly from before through the first month after surgery and then decreased over time. Cough and difficulty sleeping persisted over the five months of the study. In general, the effect of the four covariates was to increase patients' overall symptom burden.Changes in the occurrence and severity of these seven symptoms were variable. All seven symptoms occurred at relatively high rates and were of moderate severity. Findings can be used to identify patients who are at higher risk for more severe symptoms.",53
https://openalex.org/W2796497737,10.1093/jbcr/iry006.347,425 Psychosocial Posttraumatic Growth in Pediatric Burn Survivors,"Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and other emotional/behavioral challenges are common in children exposed to traumatic events. However, many children also experience positive psychological benefits, termed posttraumatic growth (PTG). PTG has been found in a variety of pediatric populations, as well as in adult burn patients. However, to our knowledge the specific construct of PTG has not been assessed in pediatric burn survivors. This study examined prevalence of PTG, demographic/burn injury correlates of PTG, and associations between PTG and PTSS. Participants were part of a larger Burn Model System national database and included children between the ages of 8 and 17. Participants completed the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS) and Post Traumatic Growth Inventory-Child (PTGI-C). Demographic and burn injury data were also gathered. Linear regression models were completed at 6 months to predict PTGI scores. One model included demographic and injury characteristics as predictors and one model included the psychosocial CPSS score as a predictor. A total of 59 individuals had data for PTGI at 6 months post-burn. The mean PTGI score was 20.6, indicating moderate posttraumatic growth. PTGI scores at 6 months were significantly different (p<.01) between the ethnicity groups, with Hispanic participants indicating higher levels of PTG (mean = 23.5) than non-Hispanic participants (mean = 14.9). Regression results indicate other burns (i.e., non-fire/electric) (p=.01) and TBSA (p<.001) are significantly related to PTGI scores. Those with burns other than flame have on average 9.07 points higher PTGI scores, and for each 10% increase in TBSA, there is an average increase of 2.21 points in PTGI scores after adjusting for other factors (age, ethnicity, type of burn, amputation, and sex). With CPSS scores included in the model, regression results indicate that burns other than flame (p=.01), TBSA (p<.001), and CPSS scores (p=.02) are significantly related to PTGI after adjusting for other factors. For each point increase in CPSS total score, there is an average decrease of 0.27 points in PTGI scores. The majority of children exhibit at least some psychosocial growth following a burn. Hispanic children exhibit significantly more growth than their non-Hispanic peers. Fire/flame injured children exhibit less growth than those burned by other mechanisms. As traumatic stress symptoms increase, PTG slightly decreases. Mental health providers should screen for PTG and look for ways to facilitate PTG, especially in groups that exhibit low rates of growth. Moderate levels of posttraumatic growth occur in most pediatric burn patients. Data on PTG and PTSS should be gathered at discharge in order to better examine change over time and to guide interventions.",53

A study of post-traumatic symptoms, emotional stress, and behavioral problems among 152 children from southern Israel, an area prone to missile attacks, was conducted. Post-traumatic symptoms were assessed by a self-reported version of the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index for Children (CPTS-RI). Emotional and behavioral problems were assessed by the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL), which was completed by the children's mothers. The mothers were asked to answer the CBCL regarding their children's behavior both in the present and prior to the missile attacks. CBCL results were then compared with those of comparable children (n = 125) living in central Israel who were not exposed to missile attacks and whose mothers were asked to answer a similar questionnaire. The results indicated that prolonged exposure to security threats did not result in high levels of posttraumatic symptoms. However, according to the mothers the emotional and behavioral states of the children deteriorated. This was found also when their current emotional and behavioral state was compared to similar children in central Israel. The complex effect of prolonged exposure to security threats is discussed.",53

Subsequently, 3 clinical categories were created: high (score, 40-56), moderate (score, 26-38), and low (score, 8-25).ResultsFrom the entire mild TBI group, 4 patient clusters with distinct patterns for fatigue, emotional distress, and coping styles were found with LCGA. Clusters 1 and 2 showed favorable recovery from fatigue over time, with low emotional distress and the predominant use of active coping in cluster 1 (30%) and low emotional distress and decreasing passive coping in cluster 2 (25%). Clusters 3 and 4 showed unfavorable recovery, with persistent high fatigue and increasing passive coping together with low emotional distress in cluster 3 (27%) and high emotional distress in cluster 4 (18%). Patients with adverse trajectories were more often women and more often experiencing sleep disturbances and pain.ConclusionsThe prognosis for recovery from posttraumatic fatigue is favorable for 55% of mild TBI patients. Patients at risk for chronic fatigue can be signaled in the acute phase postinjury based on the presence of high fatigue, high passive coping, and, for a subgroup of patients, high emotional distress. LCGA proved to be a highly valuable and multipurpose statistical method to map distinct courses of disease-related processes over time.",53

Research also suggests that impaired self-control (in particular, heightened present bias) could be linked to delayed-onset post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among survivors of natural disasters. We examined a hypothesis that the association between disaster experiences and delayed-onset PTSS is mediated through present bias among older survivors of the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami. Methods The baseline survey was conducted for older adults who lived in a city located 80 km west of the epicentre 7 months before the disaster. Approximately 2.5 and 8.5 years after the disaster, we surveyed older survivors to assess the trajectory of PTSS (2230 participants). We implemented analyses by three analytical groups: (1) resilient versus delayed-onset, (2) resilient versus improved and (3) resilient versus persistent. Results Logistic regression models showed that major housing damage was linked to raised present bias in all analytical groups (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.04 to 5.87; OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.20 to 6.29; OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.15 to 6.10, respectively). The present bias, however, was significantly associated with only delayed-onset PTSS (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.69). In the group of resilient versus delayed onset, housing destruction was also associated with delayed-onset PTSS (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.37), and the association was attenuated by present bias (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.07 to 5.18). Conclusions Present bias could mediate the association between housing damage and delayed-onset PTSS among older survivors of a natural disaster.",53

A 20-Year Follow-Up Study,"Abstract We examined the differences in physical health outcomes over a 20-year period between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) and heterosexual middle-aged and older adults. We also examined whether the associations were moderated by social support and affect. The analytical sample included 168 LGB adults and 336 propensity-matched heterosexual adults from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study, ranging in age from 25 to 74 years (mean age=42.83) at baseline. Using negative binomial generalized estimating equations and mixed-effects analyses, data from three waves of MIDUS, spanning approximately 20 years from 1995 to 2014, were used to examine the associations between sexual orientation and the health outcomes (number of chronic conditions and functional limitations). Social support and affect were added to the models to test for moderation. The results found that LGB participants reported one more chronic condition at baseline and scored significantly higher for functional limitations. However, LGB participants increased less over time for number of chronic conditions than heterosexual participants, and there were no significant differences in terms of changes in functional limitation over time. Positive affect reduced the strength of the relationship between sexual orientation and functional limitations for LGB participants. No other moderating effects were significant. The results of this study suggest that LGB individuals may become resilient to the negative health effects of minority stressors over time. Interventions should focus on improving the health of LGB individuals when they are younger and more at risk of negative health outcomes.",54

Methods The sample consisted of 175 children (52% girls, aged M = 11.98, SD = 3.20, range = 6–20 years) from 92 families, of which 90 parents with a current or past cancer diagnosis and 71 healthy co-parents also completed questionnaires. Children reported on PTSD symptoms, trauma-related cognitions, emotion regulation difficulties, general family functioning, and family communication. Both parents reported on their own PTSD symptoms. Associations were investigated using multilevel regression. Results Twenty-seven percentage of the children showed clinically relevant PTSD symptoms. Intraclass correlations indicated that children from the same family showed little overlap in these symptoms. Multilevel analyses showed that child trauma-related cognitions and emotion regulation difficulties were related to higher levels of PTSD symptoms at the individual level. General family functioning was only related to child PTSD symptoms at the family level. Child PTSD severity was unrelated to parental PTSD symptoms and family communication at the family level when taking into account the other factors. Conclusions The current study highlights the psychological impact of parental cancer on children. Individual factors contributed more strongly to child PTSD symptoms than family factors. Trauma-related cognitions and emotion regulation difficulties might be targeted through specific psychoeducation for children and parents, family-oriented support and interventions, and evidence-based treatments for child PTSD.",54

The present study aims to determine its longitudinal validity by assessing its responsiveness and response shift from 3 to 6 months post-injury. Analyses were based on data from the European longitudinal observational cohort Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury study. A total of 1659 individuals recovering from TBI were included in the analyses. Response shift was assessed using longitudinal measurement invariance testing within the confirmatory factor analyses framework. Responsiveness was analyzed using linear regression models that compared changes in functional recovery as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) with changes in the QoLIBRI scales from 3 to 6 months post-injury. Longitudinal tests of measurement invariance and analyses of discrepancies in practical significance indicated the absence of response shift. Changes in functional recovery status from three to six months were significantly associated with the responsiveness of the QoLIBRI scales over the same time period. The QoLIBRI can be used in longitudinal studies and is responsive to changes in an individual's functional recovery during the first 6 months after TBI.,54

It is assumed that most people aspire to belong and be integrated into their society. A sense of only partial belonging is therefore distressing for them. Methods Two hypotheses are examined in the current study: (a) A higher level of PPSB will predict a lower level of resilience and a higher level of psychological symptoms. (b) PPSB will mediate the associations between three stress-evoking demographic characteristics (younger age, low income, and gender) and the lower psychological resilience and higher distress associated with these demographic characteristics. These hypotheses were examined using a sample of the Israeli Jewish public ( N = 1,502) who responded to an anonymous questionnaire about the investigated issues. The data were collected by an internet panel company possessing a database of more than 65,000 residents, representing the varied components of the Israeli society. Results The findings supported our hypotheses: (a) PPSB negatively predicted societal and individual resilience and hope and positively predicted distress symptoms and sense of danger. (b) PPSB mediated the effects of the investigated demographic variables on these psychological variables. Conclusion These results are discussed in association with the concept of belonging competencies. Our findings display that being unsure about one’s belonging to a desired social group, has a major role in increasing psychological distress and sense of danger and in reducing hope and both individual and societal resilience.",54
https://openalex.org/W3016061611,10.1002/aur.2301,An Initial Examination of Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder in Mothers of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Challenging Child Behaviors as Criterion A Traumatic Stressors,"Abstract Parenting a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with high levels of stress. Several studies have conceptualized this as a traumatic stress response to challenging child behaviors such as self‐harm, suicidal ideation, and physical aggression toward caregivers. In the present study, we explored the relevance of a trauma‐based diagnostic framework to a sample of 30 mothers ( M age = 42.97, SD = 5.82) of children with ASD ( M age = 12.43, SD = 3.15). Participants were interviewed using the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale for DSM‐5 (CAPS‐5) for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and an abbreviated Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to assess for comorbidity. Three participants were excluded as they met criteria for PTSD from a traumatic event unrelated to their parenting experience. Of the remaining 27 participants, 6 (22.2%) met criteria for PTSD in the context of traumatic parenting experiences. Descriptions of traumatic events experienced are summarized. Results suggest that, for some parents, challenging child behaviors such as physical violence toward the caregiver from the child, self‐injurious behaviors, and suicidal behaviors function as traumatic stressors as per Criterion A of PTSD (American Psychiatric Association [2013]. Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders [DSM‐5] . Arlington, VA). This has implications for health professionals engaged with parents of children with ASD, who should consider the possibility of PTSD when challenging behaviors of a potentially traumatic nature are present. Autism Res 2020 . © 2020 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary This study found that some challenging behaviors exhibited by children with autism spectrum disorder can be traumatic for parents and lead to the development of post‐traumatic stress disorder. Some of these behaviors included self‐harming behaviors like head banging, expressing suicidal urges, and becoming physically aggressive toward parents during meltdowns.

The goal is to better assess both the vulnerability and impact generated by this climate change issue in order to offer preparedness, response, and post-crisis solutions for individuals, societies, and ecosystems in the European Union. The chapter begins by discussing the concept of resilience and its evolution in order to demonstrate its relationship with ecological, social, and psychological issues and its buffer against traumatic developments. It outlines the strong relation between ecosystem degradation and socio-economic status by analysing humanity's negative ecological impact and how this increases vulnerability to hydrometeorological extremes. In fact, disasters like tsunami and hurricane Katrina have brought mental health issues into the limelight. The consequences of climate change can affect nearly every aspect of human life, including physical and mental health, in the form of dysfunctional responses.",54

Changes in the connectivity strength of these network upon acute stress may predict vulnerability to long-term stress effects, which can only be tested in prospective longitudinal studies. Using such longitudinal design, we investigated whether the magnitude of acute-stress induced functional connectivity changes (delta-FC) predicts the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a relatively resilient group of young police students that are known to be at high risk for trauma-exposure. Using resting-state fMRI, we measured acute-stress induced delta-FC in 190 police recruits before (baseline) and after trauma exposure during repeated emergency aid services (16-month follow-up). Delta-FC was then linked to the changes in perceived stress levels (PSS) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PCL and CAPS). Weakened connectivity between the SN and DMN core regions upon acute stress induction at baseline predicted longitudinal increases in perceived stress level but not of post-traumatic stress symptoms, whereas increased coupling between the overall SN and anterior cerebellum was observed in participants with higher clinician-rated PTSD symptoms, particularly intrusion levels. All effects remained significant when controlling for trauma exposure-levels and cortisol stress-reactivity. Neither hormonal nor subjective measures exerted similar predictive or acquired effects. The reconfiguration of large-scale neural networks upon acute stress induction is relevant for assessing and detecting risk and resilience factors for PTSD. This study highlights the SN connectivity-changes as a potential marker for trauma-related symptom-development, which is sensitive even in a relatively resilient sample.",54

Participants (N = 90) were randomly assigned to CSC-T (N = 44; 63.6% white; 27.3% female; mean age = 51.32 ± 7.87) or comprehensive smoking cessation (CSC) alone (N = 46; 71.7% white; 28.3% female; mean age = 48.74 ± 10.66), which was comparable in length and time. Assessments included a diagnostic clinical interview and self-report measures of PTSD and respiratory symptoms, and smoking behavior, and biologically confirmed smoking abstinence. Evaluations occurred at a baseline visit, each treatment session, and at 1-, 2-, 4-, 12-, and 26-weeks post-treatment. The two treatments did not differ in regard to PTSD symptom improvement. After quit day (week 6), the two groups had similar 7-day (~15%) and 6-month (~20%) abstinence rates as well as average number of cigarettes smoked, and PTSD and respiratory symptoms. It is possible that the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy skills specific to quitting smoking, group-based support, and degree of therapist contact, that were available in both treatments may have played a role in equalizing the abstinence rates between the two conditions. Although the current study found no evidence that the CSC-T was superior to the CSC alone treatment, the abstinence rates observed were high relative to previous trials of smokers with diagnosed PTSD. Further development of smoking cessation programs tailored to the needs of smokers with PTSD symptoms continues to be needed. This study suggests that a CSC program aids in smoking abstinence for smokers with PTSD symptoms and that incorporating trauma management skills, may not add additional benefits for abstinence and PTSD and respiratory symptom relief. Further work is needed to improve smoking cessation efforts for smokers with PTSD symptoms.",54

The phenomena most commonly reported on are posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive, and general (or nonspecific) anxiety symptoms. Approximately 1 in 5 critical illness survivors has clinically significant PTSD symptoms, 1 in 3 has clinically significant depressive symptoms, and 1 in 3 has clinically significant anxiety symptoms. These phenomena are associated with diminished quality of life and functioning. Risk factors include pre-critical illness anxiety and depression, in-critical illness sedative doses and nightmare-like experiences, and post–critical illness psychological distress and poor coping early in the recovery period. Given the association between critical illness and psychological distress, it is important to address survivors’ mental health needs.",54

Many of them spent a prolonged period of time in transit - time after they leave their country of origin and before they reach the receiving country. Transit brings numerous protection and mental health risks refugees are exposed to.Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the stressful and traumatic experiences refugees are exposed to during transit, with a special focus on the experience of pushback - the denial of access to the territory to foreign nationals and forcible return to countries of origin or neighbouring countries without an assessment of their rights to international protection, as well as the impact of these experiences on refugees' mental health and well-being.Method: 201 refugees currently residing in Serbia completed the Stressful and Traumatic Experiences in Transit questionnaire - short version (SET-SF), questionnaire for assessing stressful and traumatic experiences during pushback (SET-SF PB), Refugee Health Screener (RHS-15), and Well-being index (WHO-5).Results: The results showed that refugees experience a large number of stressful and traumatic events (M = 10.27, SD = 4.85). In addition, half of the participants experience severe symptoms of depression (50.7%), while about a third of the participants experience severe symptoms of anxiety (37.8%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (32.3%). Refugees who experienced pushback showed overall higher levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Traumatic experiences during transit and pushback were positively related to the severity of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. In addition, traumatic experiences during pushback showed an incremental contribution in predicting refugees' mental health difficulties over and above traumatic experiences in transit.Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the multiple risks refugees are exposed to and emphasise the need for the provision of adequate protection and support.There is a high prevalence of traumatic experiences refugees face during transit and pushback, a high prevalence of mental health problems, and impaired psychological well-being in refugees.Traumatic experiences contribute to mental health problems.Urgent measures are needed.",54

The current study aimed to investigate whether a curvilinear model explained the VPTG-STS relationship among a sample of 365 nurses, psychologists, counselors, social workers, and medical doctors. Results supported this hypothesis, however this result appeared to largely be governed by the curvilinear relationship found among psychologists; STS was not found to predict VPTG among any other profession. Implications of results are discussed.",54

Yet there is a dearth of research in military populations on the longitudinal patterns of alcohol use. This study aims to identify group trajectories of alcohol consumption in the UK military and to identify associations with childhood adversity, deployment history and mental disorder. Data on weekly alcohol consumption across an eight year period and three phases of a UK military cohort study (n = 667) were examined using growth mixture modelling. Five alcohol trajectory classes were identified: mid-average drinkers (55%), abstainers (4%), low level drinkers (19%), decreasing drinkers (3%) and heavy drinkers (19%). Alcohol consumption remained stable over the three periods in all classes, other than in the small decreasing trajectory class. Individuals in the heavy drinking class were more likely to have deployed to Iraq. Abstainers and heavy drinkers were more likely to report post-traumatic stress disorders at baseline compared to average drinkers. Heavy drinkers in the UK military did not change their drinking pattern over a period of eight years. This highlights the need to develop effective preventive programmes to lessen the physical and psychological consequences of long-term heavy alcohol use. Individuals with a mental health problem appeared more likely to either be drinking at a high level or to be abstaining from use.",54

We sought to identify distinct trajectories of distress during primary treatment into survivorship and to identify variables that are determinants of which patient follows which type of adjustment trajectory. Psychological distress was measured at four significant time points (after surgery/biopsy, at treatment completion, two and six months thereafter) among 181 newly diagnosed BC patients. A latent growth mixture modeling approach was used to identify distinct distress trajectories. Four distress trajectories were identified: a ‘resilient’ pattern (73.1%), a ‘high-remitting’ (7.7%) trajectory, a ‘delayed’ increase in distress (7.9%), and a constantly high ‘chronic’ distress (11.3%) pattern. High perceived burden from physical symptoms at treatment completion encompassed a higher chance for the ‘high-remitting’ and ‘chronic’ distress trajectory. High self-efficacy at baseline increased chances for the ‘high-remitting’ pattern. Neither type of treatment, demographic or medical characteristics, nor baseline distress reliably predicted distress trajectories. The majority of BC patients adjust well through a demanding treatment period. High patient-perceived burden from physical symptoms, and high coping self-efficacy is suggesting a transient, self-limiting distress trajectory, while patients experiencing constant ‘chronic’ distress, and those developing distress following treatment completion only cannot be identified by a single, initial assessment. Only systematic tracking with repeated measurement extending into survivorship can eliminate this problem. Interventions should aim at reducing the impact of symptom burden on women's every-day life and on strengthening coping-self efficacy.",54

A multiple indirect effects model was used to characterize direct and indirect associations between combat exposure and physical symptoms.Despite a zero-order correlation between combat exposure and physical symptoms, the multiple indirect effects analysis did not provide evidence of a direct association between these variables. Evidence for a significant indirect association of combat exposure and physical symptoms was observed through PTSD, depression, and insomnia symptoms. In fact, 92% of the total effect of combat exposure on physical symptoms scores was indirect. These findings were evident even after adjusting for the physical injury and relevant demographics.This is the first empirical study to suggest that PTSD, depression and insomnia collectively and independently contribute to the association between combat exposure and post-deployment physical symptoms.

Participants underwent assessment during hospital admission (n = 1388) and at 12 months after injury (n = 852). Networks of symptom associations were analyzed in the acute and chronic phases using partial correlations, relative importance estimates, and centrality measures of each symptom in terms of its association strengths, closeness to other symptoms, and importance in connecting other symptoms to each other. Data were analyzed from March 3 to September 5, 2016.Severity of PTSD was assessed at each assessment with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale.Of the 1138 patients undergoing assessment at admission (837 men [73.6%] and 301 women [26.4%]; mean [SD] age, 37.90 [13.62] years), strong connections were found in the acute phase. Reexperiencing symptoms were central to other symptoms in the acute phase, with intrusions and physiological reactivity among the most central symptoms in the networks in terms of the extent to which they occur between other symptoms (mean [SD], 1.2 [0.7] and 1.0 [0.9], respectively), closeness to other symptoms (mean [SD], 0.9 [0.3] and 1.1 [0.9], respectively), and strength of the associations (mean [SD], 1.6 [0.3] and 1.5 [0.3] respectively) among flashbacks, intrusions, and avoidance of thoughts, with moderately strong connections between intrusions and nightmares, being upset by reminders, and physiological reactivity. Intrusions and physiological reactivity were central in the acute phase. Among the 852 patients (73.6%) who completed the 12-month assessment, overall network connectivity was significantly stronger at 12 months than in the acute phase (global strength values, 6.57 vs 7.60; paired difference, 1.03; P < .001). The network associations among the reexperiencing symptoms were strengthened at 12 months, and physiological reactivity was strongly associated with the startle response, which was also associated with hypervigilance. Strong connectivity among emotional numbing, detachment from others, and disinterest in activities as well as moderately strong links among irritability (anger), concentration deficits, and sleep disturbance were found.As time elapses after trauma, fear circuitry and dysphoric PTSD symptoms appear to emerge as connected networks. Intrusive memories and reactivity are centrally associated with other symptoms in the acute phase, potentially pointing to the utility of addressing these symptoms in early intervention strategies.",55

Of the 1,730 veterans surveyed, 95% were male, 44% were under 64 years old, 96% were white race, 40% reported multiple warzone deployments, and 38% (n=665) had served as National Guard/Reserve service members. In addition, 23% (n=396) serviced in Iraq, Afghanistan, or the Global War on Terrorism. The prevalence of current PTSD was 5.4% (probable PTSD = 7.6%), current depression was 8%, 23% had used mental health services in the past year, and 50% had used the VA in the past year. The most common current disorder was related to alcohol misuse, with 24% of veterans screening positive on the AUDIT-C scale. In addition, 28% reported a history of concussion during their military service. Analyses indicated that PTSD, depression, mental health service use, alcohol misuse, suicidality, and stressful life events were more common among National Guard/Reserve veterans, compared to other era veterans (p-values 0.05). However, other era veterans were more likely to rate themselves in fair or poor health and to report a service-connected disability (p-values 0.05). Nevertheless, multivariable analyses that adjusted for demographic differences, level of combat exposure, current life stressors, and current social support, found no differences in mental health status and mental health service use among the veteran groups. To date, analyses suggest that while deployed National Guard/Reserve service members tended to have a higher prevalence of mental health disorders and mental health service use, when the data were adjusted for demographic difference and potential confounders, there were few differences in outcomes between these groups.",55

This longitudinal observational study used data from actively deployed troops to correlate third-person observer ratings of deployment peritraumatic behaviors [Peritraumatic Behavior Questionnaire - Observer Rated (PBQ-OR)] collected on a bi-monthly basis with post-deployment (1-wk follow-up) ratings of the previously validated PBQ self-rate version (PBQ-SR), and (3-mo follow-up) clinician assessed and self-report posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, PTSD Checklist). Cronbach's alpha (α) and correlation coefficients were calculated to assess internal reliability and concurrent validity respectively.Eight hundred and sixty male Marines were included in this study after signing informed consents at pre-deployment (mean age 23.2 ± 2.6 years). Although our findings were limited by an overall sparse return rate of PBQ-OR ratings, the main results indicate satisfactory psychometric properties with good internal consistency for the PBQ-OR (α = 0.88) and high convergent and concurrent validity with 1-wk post-deployment PBQ-SR ratings and 3-mo posttraumatic stress symptoms. Overall, later PBQ-OR report date was associated with higher correlation between PBQ-OR and post-deployment measures. Kappa analysis between PBQ-OR and PBQ-SR single items, showed best agreement in questions relating of mortal peril, desire for revenge, and experience of intense physical reactions. Logistic regression demonstrated satisfactory predictive validity of PBQ-OR total score with respect to PTSD caseness (OR = 1.0513; 95%CI: 1.011-1.093; P = 0.02).Since no comparable tools have been developed, PBQ-OR could be valuable as real-time screening tool for earlier detection of Service Members at risk.",55

These experiences might create serious mental problems, especially in children and adolescents who might have an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mental health status of Syrian refugee children who exposed to a variety of traumatic events.Method: The sample consisted of 1518 drug-naive Syrian refugee children and adolescents aged between 8 and 16 years who were admitted to the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department in Hatay State Hospital between June 2016 and December 2018. The CRIES-13 (Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale-13) was used to evaluate PTSD symptoms and CDI (Children's Depression Inventory) was used to examine depressive symptoms. The sample was divided into three groups according to the type of trauma and the CRIES-13 and CDI scores were compared between the groups.Results: The mean age of the children was 12.4 ± 3.1. 46.9% of the children were male and 53.1% were female. The total score and intrusion and arousal subscores of CRIES-13 were significantly different between the three groups. The total CDI score was also significantly different between the three groups. The likelihood rates of PTSD and depression differed significantly between the groups.Conclusion: Traumatized Syrian refugee children may present PTSD symptoms more likely than depressive symptoms. War-related traumatic experiences may have more adverse effects on Syrian children’s psychology than other traumas.",55

Past research has investigated negative (e.g., stress) and positive (e.g., growth) following natural disasters, but few studies have explored the complex relationships between factors leading to both types of outcomes. The goal of this study was to examine factors predicting posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) in survivors of Hurricanes Maria and Michael, both of which struck Florida in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Specifically, we investigated how hazard-specific factors, coping strategies, and character strengths were related to PTSS, PTG, or both. An online survey was conducted six to 14 months after the hurricanes among survivors (N ​= ​566). Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted with variables entered systematically. Survivors were more likely to report current PTSS if they (1) experienced more peritraumatic negative emotions, hazard-related stressors, or a past trauma; (2) employed negative coping strategies employed following the storms; and (3) reported low trait optimism or high trait altruism. Current PTG was associated with younger age, length of time following the hazard, more peritraumatic positive emotions and stressors, use of self-distraction and denial for coping, and higher trait optimism. Results indicate that optimism may be protective and beneficial for disaster survivors, but that altruism's role may be more complex than expected. The evidence connecting duration since the storms and PTG and PTSD suggests that the meaning-seeking struggle toward growth takes more time, though time helps healing. The findings provide guidance for subsequent prospective studies designed to improve clinical services and disaster relief.",55

To date, no previous research has studied the development of NSSI-D longitudinally, leaving questions on its stability and potential prospective predictors unanswered.2162 community adolescents (M = 15.00 years, SD = 1.88, 53.9 % girls at T1) completed a set of self-report questionnaires for three consecutive years and were classified into three severity-based NSSI subgroups (no-NSSI, subthreshold-NSSI, NSSI-D). Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to prospectively predict subgroup membership by age, gender, identity development, depressive symptoms, traumatic experiences, and resilience.At baseline, the sample was distributed over the no-NSSI group (88 %), the subthreshold-NSSI (6 %) and NSSI-D (6 %) groups. These groups respectively showed high (93.5 %), low (25 %) and moderate (47.5 %) stability over one-year intervals. Longitudinally, higher levels of identity confusion and trauma significantly increased the likelihood of transitioning to subthreshold-NSSI. Moreover, boys had a higher likelihood of transitioning from NSSI-D to no-NSSI over the course of one year.This three-year study provides the first indication of the longitudinal course of NSSI-D with the current set of DSM-5 criteria. Clinically, the results suggest the particular potential of identity confusion and trauma as prevention targets in community adolescents.",55
https://openalex.org/W4385891934,10.31219/osf.io/279sh,Trauma Exposure and Transdiagnostic Distress: Examining Shared and PTSD-Specific Associations,"Dimensional models of psychopathology suggest that the causes and consequences of psychopathology are attributable to a combination of syndrome specific and transdiagnostic features. There is considerable evidence that trauma exposure confers risk for a wide range of psychiatric conditions, yet no previous work has specifically examined the higher-order effects of trauma exposure within a structural model. We examined transdiagnostic and PTSD-specific associations with multiple forms of trauma exposure within a nation-wide sample (N = 1,649; 50% female) of military Veterans over-selected for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A higher-order Distress variable was estimated using PTSD, major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms as indicators. A structural equation model spanning three measurement time points over an average of 3.85 years was then used to examine the unique roles of higher-order Distress and PTSD residual variance in accounting for the relations between trauma exposure and psychosocial impairment. Results suggest that the association between trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms is primarily mediated by higher-order Distress, but that PTSD severity does have a significant association with trauma exposure independent of Distress. Both higher-order Distress and PTSD-specific variance were necessary to account for the association between trauma exposure and future functional impairment. This work suggests there may be shared etiology linking cumulative trauma exposure and a range of internalizing symptoms. Continued application of higher-order dimensional models is needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the consequences of trauma exposure.",55
https://openalex.org/W4372402540,10.31234/osf.io/emnk3,Exploring resilience to trauma through unsupervised clustering approach and network analysis,"Background: Experience of traumatic life events is likely to increase negative mood symptoms and trigger the onset of affective disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Early identification of high-risk individuals who are likely to suffer from mental disorders could facilitate effective psychological intervention. However, individuals differ with respect to resilience to trauma which is difficult to be quantified by certain questionnaires or biological measures. The present study stratified trauma-exposed individuals into Resilient and Sensitive subgroups using the data-driven clustering approach and explored resilience-related trauma-symptom network patterns. Method: A multi-national, cross-sectional cohort study (eight countries; total participants N=1740) with demographic variables and psychological measures of trauma, affective symptoms, and measures for religiosity were recruited between December 2015 and January 2016, and the data were analyzed between January 2022 and September 2022. We applied the hierarchical clustering approach to this cohort study and established group-specific psychological networks between 29 traumatic events and 21 negative mood symptoms and, subsequently, tested whether the network structures were significantly different across subgroups. Lastly, we evaluated whether other psychological (i.e., religiosity and death anxiety) and demographic variables (i.e., sex, age, income, and country) could determine resilience to trauma.Results: We established a stratification model that separated individuals who experienced trauma into three subgroups (i.e., Low Trauma (N = 323), Resilient (N = 677), and Sensitive (N = 740) based on inter-relationships between trauma and affective symptoms. We found that the network structure of the Resilient group was comparable to the Low Trauma group, while the Sensitive group showed a unique global connectivity pattern (i.e., low global efficiency and high modularity). A key negative mood symptom (i.e., worthlessness) and several traumatic events (i.e., destruction of someone’s home, military service, or being shot or assaulted) were identified for targeted intervention. Conclusions: Our results suggested that limited direct associations between trauma and negative mood symptoms are the network signature of low resilience to trauma. We have elaborated on the implications of using the clustering method and psychological network analyses to highlight the complex interplay between trauma and negative mood symptoms and identify key symptoms and traumatic events for early intervention.",55

Disasters are overwhelming events as they test the capability of the community and individuals to respond and can temporarily lead to massive disruption. The extensive and enduring effects of disasters are apparent on the psychological and physical health of survivors. Personality characteristics like gender, ethnicity and coping, variables connected to like injury and situation factors all are considered as threats for psychological problems after disasters. A disaster can be a frustrating and multifaceted task that proves difficult even for scholars. Natural disasters are often described as acts of God' a term that automatically eliminates human responsibility. The aftermath of natural includes an unambiguous physical impact, resulting in property damage, injury, and death of victims. These are catastrophic occurrences with the capacity to impose various kinds of hardship, e.g. loss of property and personal possessions, enduring hunger and physical discomfort, or injury to separation from family and close friends. Devastation of social support networks as well as loss of financial income is just a few examples of the long-term hardships many survivors have to experience.

The primary rationale for such studies is that determining the ‘best’ factor analytic model will result in better diagnoses if that structure is the basis for diagnostic decisions. However, there appears to be a disconnect between the factor analytic modelling and the diagnostic implications. In this study, we derived prevalence rates based on commonly reported models of PTSD, based on data from two clinical samples (N = 434), and also assessed if the different models generated consistent risk estimates in relation to the effects of childhood maltreatment. We found that the different models produced different prevalence rates, ranging from 64.5% to 83.9%. Furthermore, we found that the relationship between childhood maltreatment and ‘diagnosis’ varied considerably depending upon which latent symptom profile was adopted. It is argued that, given the maturity of this area of research, factor analytic studies of PTSD should now include information on the diagnostic implications of their findings.",56

To date, very few studies have investigated CPTSD in young patients, and there is a need for evidence on effective treatment.Objective: The present study evaluates the applicability of developmentally adapted cognitive processing therapy (D-CPT) for CPTSD in young patients in a secondary analysis of the treatment condition of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the efficacy of D-CPT.Methods: The D-CPT treatment group in the original study included 44 patients (14–21 years) with DSM-IV PTSD after childhood abuse. We used the ICD-11 algorithm to divide the sample into a probable CPTSD and a non-CPTSD group. We performed multilevel models for interviewer-rated and self-rated PTSD symptoms with fixed effects of group (CPTSD, non-CPTSD) and time (up to 12 months follow-up) and their interaction. Treatment response rates for both groups were calculated.Results: Nineteen (43.2%) patients fulfilled criteria for probable ICD-11 CPTSD while 25 (56.8%) did not. Both CPTSD and non-CPTSD groups showed symptom reduction over time. The CPTSD group reported higher symptom severity before and after treatment. Linear improvement and treatment response rates were similar for both groups. D-CPT reduced symptoms of disturbances in self-regulation in both groups.Discussion: Both, patients with and without probable ICD-11 CPTSD seemed to benefit from D-CPT and the treatment also reduced disturbances in self-regulation.Conclusion: This study presents initial evidence of the applicability of D-CPT in clinical practice for young patients with CPTSD. It remains debatable whether CPTSD implies different treatment needs as opposed to PTSD.",56

We expand the operationalization go deprivation while accounting for more acute exposures to conflict and political violence and spatial variations. We use multilevel modelling of data from the Socio-Economic &amp; Food Security Survey 2014 conducted by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, which included a sample size of 7827 households in the West Bank(WB) and Gaza Strip(GS). We conduct the analysis for the combined sample, as for the WB and GS separately. We use a General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ12) score as our main outcome measure of poor health. We used various measures of deprivation including subjective deprivation, material deprivation, food deprivation, and political deprivation. In addition to the different measures of deprivation, we included acute political, health, and economic shocks in our analysis along with background socio-demographic characteristics. The results indicate significant variance at the locality level. We find a significant association between poor mental health and subjective, economic, political, and food deprivation; health, economic, and political stressors; age, and being a woman. Post-secondary education and wealth have a significant inverse association with poor mental health. Subjective deprivation is the strongest predictor of GHQ12 score in the models whereby people who feel very deprived have GHQ12 scores that are almost 4-points higher than people who do not feel deprived. Economic conditions, particularly subjective measures, are significant predictors of mental health status. Our findings confirm that political and social factors are determinants of health. Feeling deprived is an important determinant of mental health. The community effect suggests that spatial characteristics are influencing mental health, and warrant further investigation.",56

To determine whether Army Reserve Component (RC) members (Army National Guard and Army Reserve) with positive screening scores on the PDHRA receive needed care, the investigators examined the association between positive scores and enrollment and utilization of care (“linkage”) in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), as well as rescreening scores, diagnosis, and behavioral treatment in VHA. Methods: Mixed-effects regression models were used to predict linkage to VHA within six months after RC members (N=73,164) completed the PDHRA, with alcohol misuse, depression, and PTSD screen scores as key independent variables. Regression models were stratified by gender and National Guard versus Reserve status. Among those who linked to VHA (N=25,168), screening scores and subsequent diagnosis and treatment in VHA were also examined. Results: Army RC members with positive PTSD and depression screening scores were more likely than those with negative screens to link to VHA, and most (54%−84%) received VHA treatment once diagnosed. Positive screens for alcohol misuse were associated with linkage to VHA for men but not for women, and treatment rates for alcohol use disorders were relatively low (0%−25%) for both men and women diagnosed as having an alcohol use disorder. Conclusions: The finding that Army RC members with greater indications of behavioral health problems linked to VHA is encouraging. However, more outreach and treatment engagement strategies could be directed to those with alcohol use disorder, particularly women.",56

Method: The Army STARRS (Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers) Pre/Post Deployment Study surveyed 3 Brigade Combat Teams that were deployed to Afghanistan in 2012. Lifetime TBI and past-month postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms were evaluated at predeployment baseline. Recency and number of TBIs were quantified, and TBI severity was classified on the basis of reports of alteration/loss of consciousness and memory lapse. Suicide attempt data came from administrative records and surveys administered after return from deployment. Logistic regression models estimated associations of TBI characteristics with prospective suicide attempt among baseline respondents who were deployed ( n = 7677), adjusting for other risk factors including lifetime mental disorder. Results: One hundred three soldiers made a suicide attempt over a median follow-up period of 30 months (weighted prevalence = 1.31% [0.14%]). In the final model estimating joint associations of TBI severity/recency and past-month postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms, only postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms were associated with a higher risk of suicide attempt (per standard score increase: AOR [adjusted odds ratio] = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.63; P = .012). Conclusions: Among the lifetime TBI characteristics evaluated at predeployment baseline, only past-month postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms were prospectively associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt following deployment. Detection of postconcussive/post-TBI symptoms could facilitate targeting of Army suicide prevention programs.",56

Parents and teachers reported on a SC measure at ages 5, 10, and 12. We tested the existence of different trajectories and whether they discriminated outcomes in early adolescence. The data were collected from different sources, the children, the parents, and teachers, by means of different methods. Using Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM), we identified three distinct social cognition trajectories: persistently mild difficulties reported by parents and teachers (7.9% of the children), stable low problems reported by parents and increased difficulties reported by teachers (10.5% of the sample), and stable low problems reported by both informants for most of the participants (81.5%). Comparison of the psychological outcomes between classes using regression models showed that the two trajectories including children with any level of problems differ from the normative one as regards their association with psychological problems, daily functioning, and variables, such as aggressive behavior and callousness. The two non-normative trajectories also differ from each other in terms of the personal characteristics of the adolescents included in them. Adolescents in the increasing problematic class in the school have a tougher and more problematic style of social relating, while children with persistent and non-context-dependent difficulties are more anxious. These results might help to better detect and design specific interventions for children with deficits in SC that might respond to different personal characteristics leading to different outcomes.",56

However, the study of potential mechanisms of the intergenerational transmission of trauma to offspring is still lacking. This prospective study aimed to assess the role of fathers' PTSD symptoms (PTSS), paternal parenting, and adult offspring's attachment insecurities in adult offspring's PTSS.A sample of 124 Israeli father-child dyads (80 ex-POW dyads and a comparison group of 44 veteran dyads) completed self-report measures. The fathers participated in three waves of measurements following the Yom Kippur War (T1: 1991, T2: 2003, T3: 2008), while the offspring took part in T4 (2013).Offspring of ex-POWs with PTSD at T3 reported more PTSS and higher levels of attachment insecurities than offspring of ex-POWs without PTSD and controls at T4. Fathers' proximity to the children and sensitivity to the children's needs were negatively related. Offspring's attachment insecurities were positively related to offspring's PTSS. Importantly, serial multiple mediation model results show that war captivity increased the level of the fathers' PTSD at T2 and T3, which in turn decreased the level of the fathers' parenting at T3, and thereby increased the level of offspring's attachment avoidance at T4, which by its own merit was related to higher levels of adult offspring's PTSS.The mechanisms of the intergenerational transmission of captivity-related trauma of veterans' PTSD and paternal parenting, through offspring's attachment insecurities and offspring's PTSS, was exemplified.",56

The relation of these factors to prolonged injury symptoms and later visits into psychiatric care was assessed.Methods Demographic information, pre-injury learning status, and neuropsychological test results of 120 patients aged 7–16 years were retrospectively collected from the hospital medical records. Data were compared with self- or parent-reported injury symptoms at 1–3 months post-injury and later visits to psychiatric care.Results According to medical records, 14.2% of the children with mTBI had a diagnosed neurobehavioral or psychiatric condition pre-injury. Additionally, 53.3% of the children had some neurobehavioral or psychiatric concerns or traits prior to the injury. Over half (56.7%) of the children studied were symptomatic at 1–3 months following the injury. Female gender and presence of prolonged symptoms were predictive for later visit into psychiatric care.Conclusions Pre-injury neurobehavioral or psychiatric problems may predict prolonged injury symptoms following pediatric mTBI. In this retrospective patient series, prolonged symptoms and female gender seem to predict the need for later psychiatric care. Monitoring the recovery of children with mTBI and pre-injury risk factors is important for timely interventions.",56

Virtual reality exposure (VRE) has shown promise but randomized trials are needed to evaluate efficacy relative to existing standards of care. This study evaluated the efficacy of VRE and PE for active duty soldiers with PTSD from deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.Active-duty soldiers (N = 162) were randomized to 10-sessions of PE, VRE, or a minimal attention waitlist (WL). Blinded assessors evaluated symptoms at baseline, halfway through treatment, at posttreatment, and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS).Intent-to-treat analyses found that both PE and VRE resulted in significant reductions in PTSD symptoms relative to those in the WL. The majority of patients demonstrated reliable change in PTSD symptoms. There was no difference between PE and VRE regarding treatment drop out before completing 10 sessions (44 and 41% for VRE and PE, respectively). Contrary to hypotheses, analyses at posttreatment did not show that VRE was superior to PE. Post hoc analyses found that PE resulted in significantly greater symptom reductions than VRE at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Both treatments significantly reduced self-reported stigma.PE is an efficacious treatment for active-duty Army soldiers with PTSD from deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan. Results extend previous evidence supporting the efficacy of PE to active-duty military personnel and raise important questions for future research on VRE. (PsycINFO Database Record",56

Perceived life threat and assaultive trauma are consistent risk factors for subsequent PTSD development, although less work has explored them in combination. The current study evaluated whether trauma type (assaultive vs. nonassaultive) and perceived life threat, together, led to greater PTSD symptoms 1 month and 6 months postinjury.Participants included adult injured trauma survivors admitted to a level 1 trauma center. While hospitalized, perceived life threat during trauma was assessed and mechanism of injury was collected via record review and was collapsed into two categories: assaultive and nonassaultive. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fifth Edition]) was administered at 1 month (N = 137) and 6 months (N = 220) after injury.The four symptoms clusters of PTSD (intrusions, avoidance, hyperarousal, and negative mood/cognitions) were examined using four 2 (time) × 2 (life threat) × 2 (trauma type) mixed methods analyses of variance to assess differences based on risk factors and time. Results showed significant interaction effects of life threat, trauma type, and time for intrusive symptoms and avoidance symptoms. Individuals with life threat during assaultive traumas maintained heightened intrusive symptoms across time and increased avoidance at 6 months. On the other hand, participants with either life threat or assaultive traumas had decreased symptoms at 6 months.Experiencing assaultive trauma and life threat led to greater symptoms of PTSD. Individuals with assaultive traumas who experienced life threat may represent a specific at-risk group following injury. Avoidance can protract functional impairment and impede access to care, negatively impacting recovery. This study highlights a need to assess for these peritrauma factors during hospitalization and supports early intervention targeting avoidance and intrusive symptoms in this group.Prognostic/Epidemiologic, Level IV.",56

The aim of this study was to explore the variability on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (ASD) prevalence and evaluate the specific weight of different variables on PTSD development among adult burn patients. A systematic review was carried out to explore the prevalence of ASD and PTSD and identify their predictors. Meta-analytical methods were used to explore the strength of association between PTSD and the latter. From an initial pool of 190 studies, 24 were used in the systematic review, and only 19 studies could be used for the meta-analysis because of different methodological limitations. The prevalence of ASD at baseline ranged from 2 to 30% and prevalence of PTSD ranged from 3 to 35% at 1 month, 2 to 40% between 3 and 6 months, 9 to 45% in the year postinjury and ranged 7 to 25% more than 2 years later. Life threat perception was the strongest predictor for PTSD occurrence, followed by acute intrusive symptoms and pain associated with burn injuries. Predictive variables identified in this research may be useful in targeting burn patients who are at risk for developing posttraumatic stress symptoms and stress-related psychological symptoms.",57

The study also explores the buffering role of PTG on the associations between posttraumatic stress (PTS), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and psychological distress.A multicenter, longitudinal, prospective study was conducted among AYA cancer patients aged 14-39 years. One hundred sixty-nine patients completed a self-report measure of PTG (PTGI) and PTS (PDS) 6, 12, and 24 months after baseline (within the first 4 months of diagnosis). At 24-month follow-up, HRQoL (SF-36) and psychological distress (BSI-18) were also assessed.Among participants, 14% showed increasing PTG, 45% remained at a stable high PTG level, 14% showed decreasing PTG, and 27% remained at a stable low PTG level. AYAs who remained high on PTG were more often younger, female, and received chemotherapy. PTG level at 6-month follow-up was predictive of mental HRQoL (β = 0.19; p = 0.026) and psychological distress (β = -0.14; p = 0.043) at 24-month follow-up when corrected for PTS and sociodemographic and clinical covariates. No relationship between PTG and physical HRQoL was found. The interactive effects of PTS and PTG on outcomes were not significant, indicating that buffering did not take place.This study indicates that PTG is dynamic and predicts mental well-being outcomes but does not buffer the effects of PTS. Psychosocial interventions should focus on promoting PTG and reducing PTS in order to promote the adjustment of AYAs diagnosed with cancer.",57

Based on ecological theory (Bronfenbrenner, 2005), this study analyses how factors related to the child (cognitive capacity), their family (parental depression and parenting styles), and their school (teachers' practices and peer relations) mediate the association between traumatic stress (traumatic war experiences and stressful life-events) and child mental health (posttraumatic stress and psychological distress symptoms). The participants were 303 Palestinian children (51.2% girls) of 10-13 years (M = 10.94 ± 0.50) and their parents from the Gaza Strip. The children filled in questionnaires during school classes and the parents did so at their homes. The results of structural equation modeling substantiated the hypothesis that parental depression, poor parenting and low-quality peer relations mediated between traumatic stress and children's mental health problems. Contrary to the hypothesis, child-related factors did not mediate that association. To conclude, parents and peers provide important age-salient social resources for children in war conditions, and psychosocial interventions should therefore enhance their beneficial functions.",57

In addition, VVC are more likely to have low social support due to stigmatization and victim-blaming, and PTSD is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and impaired quality of life (QoL). The present study aimed to determine the impact of ASD, PTSD, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and perceived social support in relation to four domains of QoL among VVC. Individuals were recruited as part of a longitudinal study assessing the efficacy of a brief cognitive behavioral treatment for ASD. Participants (N = 127) were interviewed and completed self-report measures within 30 days of experiencing a violent crime (T0 ) and at assessments 2 months (T1 ) and 6 months (T2 ) after the event. Depressive symptoms, ASD, and PTSD were found to be associated with lower QoL ratings in all four domains. Anxiety symptoms were found to be associated with lower ratings in the physical health and psychological QoL domains. Perceived social support was found to be associated with higher QoL ratings in all domains. The proportions of QoL variance explained by the combined fixed and random effects combined ranged from 70% to 79%. Future research considerations include an examination of how early interventions for VVC could prevent QoL deterioration by targeting ASD and PTSD development, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and social support.",57

Patterns of insomnia across time were examined. Theoretically derived variables linked to sleep disturbance were examined as predictors of the insomnia patterns.Five longitudinal patterns of insomnia characterized the majority of the sample: ""No Insomnia"" (no insomnia symptoms at any timepoint; 31%), ""Deployment-related Insomnia"" (no pre-deployment insomnia, developed insomnia symptoms during deployment and recovered; 40%), ""Incident Insomnia"" (development insomnia during or shortly after deployment that did not remit; 14%), ""Chronic Insomnia"" (insomnia both pre- and post-deployment; 11%), and ""Other Insomnia"" (reported insomnia at ≥1 timepoint, but no clear pattern across the deployment cycle; 4%). Several pre-deployment factors were predictive of insomnia trajectories, including lifetime major depressive episodes, traumatic brain injury history, posttraumatic stress disorder, and past year personal life stressors.Distinct longitudinal patterns of insomnia were identified, with more than half of the sample reporting insomnia at some point in the deployment cycle. Identifying mental health conditions that are associated with different insomnia patterns prior to deployment can inform targeted interventions to reduce long-term sleep difficulty.",57

However, this hypothesis lacks strong empirical support because of the lack of prospective evidence. This study investigated whether experiencing multiple major health events diminishes rates of resilience and increases rates of mortality using a large population-based prospective cohort.There were n = 1,395 individuals sampled from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and examined prospectively from 2 years before 4 years after either single or multiple health events (lung disease, heart disease, stroke, or cancer). Distinct depression and resilience trajectories were identified using latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM). These trajectories were compared on rates of mortality 4 years after the health events.Findings indicated that 4 trajectories best fit the data including resilience, emergent postevent depression, chronic pre-to-post depression, and depressed prior followed by improvement. Analyses demonstrate that multiple health events do not decrease rates of resilience but do increase the severity of symptoms among those on the emergent depression trajectory. Emergent depression increased mortality compared with all others but among those in this class, rates were not different in response to single versus multiple health events.Multiple major stressors do not reduce rates of resilience. The emergence of depression after health events does significantly increase risk for mortality regardless of the number of events. (PsycINFO Database Record",57

We examined whether changes in mental health observed during active duty were associated with indices of post-military adjustment.Survey data from the multi-wave Army STARRS Pre/Post Deployment Study (PPDS; conducted 2012-2014) were linked to follow-up data from wave 1 of the STARRS Longitudinal Study (STARRS-LS1; conducted 2016-2018). Empirical Bayes estimates of intercepts and slopes of posttraumatic stress, problematic anger, and depressive symptoms during the PPDS were extracted from mixed-effects growth models and evaluated as predictors of life stress among 1080 participants who had separated or retired from the Army at STARRS-LS1; and of job satisfaction among 586 veterans who were employed at STARRS-LS1.Higher average levels and larger increases in posttraumatic stress, anger, and depression over the deployment period were each associated with increased stress and (in the case of anger and depression) reduced job satisfaction. Posttraumatic stress and anger slopes were associated with overall stress (b = 5.60, p < 0.01 and b = 15.64, p = 0.04, respectively) and relationship stress (b = 5.50, p = 0.01 and b = 22.86, p = 0.01, respectively) beyond the average levels of those symptoms.Some transition-related difficulties may have resolved before outcome assessment; some measures were not previously validated.Larger increases in posttraumatic stress and anger over a deployment period were associated with increased stress after leaving the Army, even after controlling for average symptom levels during the same period. Monitoring changes in mental health during active duty may help identify personnel who need additional support to facilitate the military-to-civilian transition.",57

Maternal mental health symptoms predict child function. When mothers have sustained posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), their children at are risk for growth and developmental delays and poor behavioral outcomes that may adversely affect the course of their lives. While many who experience trauma will recover without intervention, a significant proportion will experience PTSD, with negative consequences for their personal lives and the lives of their families. Early identification of those at high risk for PTSD symptoms will support early interventions to prevent PTSD and its negative consequences. Methods: This paper describes the development of a tool that can predict PTSD symptoms at 8 months in mothers who are primarily of low socioeconomic status and primarily members of underrepresented groups. The tool consists of four key measures. Conclusions: Using this tool to identify mothers at high risk for sustained PTSD and entering them into early intervention programs may protect mothers and their children from negative outcomes and promote their health and wellbeing.",58

Patients completed the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire with a Cognition bolt-on shortly after hospital admission, which included a recalled pre-injury measure, and, again, at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post-burn. Burn severity was indicated by the number of surgeries, and PTSD symptoms were assessed with the IES-R at three months post-burn. Pre- and post-injury HRQL were compared to norm populations.Recalled pre-injury HRQL was higher than population norms and HRQL at 18 months post-burn was comparable to population norms. Compared to the pre-injury level of functioning, four HRQL patterns of change over time were established: Stable, Recovery, Deterioration, and Growth. In each HRQL domain, a subset of patients did not return to their recalled pre-injury levels, especially with regard to Pain, Anxiety/Depression, and Cognition. Patients with more severe burns or PTSD symptoms were less likely to return to pre-injury level of functioning within 18 months post-burn.This study identified four patterns of individual change. Patients with more severe injuries and PTSD symptoms were more at risk of not returning to their recalled pre-injury HRQL. This study supports the face validity of using a recalled pre-burn HRQL score as a reference point to monitor HRQL after burns.",58

The severity of an individual's response to trauma is often modulated by both the degree of exposure to traumatic incidents and specific personal attributes. This study aims to explore the relationship between PTSD symptoms and a range of variables, including the frequency of exposure to missile alerts, individual characteristics, and socio-economic factors. The research focuses on Israeli civilians affected by rocket attacks launched by Hamas during the Israeli military operation ""Guardian of the Walls"" in May 2021. Our empirical analysis reveals that individuals with limited exposure to missile attacks, those belonging to larger familial units, and those possessing higher educational and income levels are generally less susceptible to post-traumatic symptoms. Data for this study were collected through comprehensive surveys that captured demographic details and employed specialized questionnaires to assess the prevalence and severity of post-traumatic symptoms. These insights have significant implications for the development of targeted preventative measures aimed at reducing the risk of PTSD among at-risk populations. Moreover, they underscore the necessity of incorporating socio-economic considerations into the provision of mental health services for communities affected by violent conflict and trauma.",58

Innovations included monthly assessments, examination of non-linear trajectories, and inclusion of coping styles as predictors. Data were derived from a six-month longitudinal study of 144 community-dwelling older adults with depressive symptoms (Short-Geriatric Depression Scale [S-GDS]≥5) with seven waves of data. Descriptive analyses and individual growth curve modeling were conducted. The majority of participants changed symptom levels over time; most participants with severe symptoms at baseline remained at least mildly depressed at six months. Younger participants were more depressed at baseline and improved slightly more than older participants. Those who used more active and emotional support coping had faster improvement and maintained gains, whereas those who used less of these coping styles demonstrated worse symptoms over the six-month follow-up period. The most significant limitations are the convenience sampling methods and relatively small sample size, although the large number of assessments (7 waves) increases precision of the statistical methods used. Findings suggest that it may be beneficial to target interventions to older adults with more severe depressive symptoms and who display low levels of active and emotional support coping. Behavioral interventions that improve these coping styles may help depressed older adults recover and maintain treatment gains over time.",58

Interventions based on trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy have shown promising results to facilitate recovery. The current trial evaluated whether a novel, scalable and digital early version of the intervention, Condensed Internet-Delivered Prolonged Exposure (CIPE), is effective in reducing post-traumatic stress symptoms.A single-site randomised controlled trial with self-referred adults (N = 102) exposed to trauma within the last 2 months. The participants were randomised to 3 weeks of CIPE or a waiting list (WL) for 7 weeks. Assessments were conducted at baseline, week 1-3 (primary endpoint), week 4-7 (secondary endpoint) and at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5).The main analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle indicated statistically significant reductions in symptoms of post-traumatic stress in the CIPE group as compared to the WL group.

Method: The longitudinal Beyond Bushfires study included 1017 respondents (Wave 1; 3–4 years after the fires), 736 (76.1%) at Wave 2 (5 years after the fires) and 525 (51.6%) at Wave 3 (10 years after the fires). The survey indexed fire-related and subsequent stressful events, probable posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, alcohol use, severe distress and receipt of health services for mental health problems. Results: Relative to their status 3–4 years after the fires, there were reduced rates of fire-related posttraumatic stress disorder (6.2% vs 12.2%), general posttraumatic stress disorder (14.9% vs 18.7%) and severe distress (4.4% vs 7.5%) at 10 years. There were comparable rates between Wave 1 and Wave 3 for depression (10.9% vs 8.3%) and alcohol abuse (21.8% vs 18.5%). Of people in high-affected regions, 22.1% had posttraumatic stress disorder, depression or severe distress at Wave 3. One-third to one-half of participants who reported probable posttraumatic stress disorder or depression at any assessment did not display the disorder at the next assessment. Worsening of mental health at Wave 3 was associated with the extent of property loss, exposure to recent traumatic events or recent stressful life events. Only 24.6% of those with a probable disorder had sought professional help for this in the previous 6 months. Conclusion: Approximately one-fifth of people from high-affected areas have a probable psychological disorder a decade after the fires. Mental health appears to fluctuate for those who are not consistently resilient, apparently as a result of ongoing stressors. The observation that most people with probable disorder are not receiving care highlights the need for further planning about managing long-term mental health needs of disaster-affected communities.",58

Using North's disaster model as a framework, the aim of this study was to identify factors associated with clinically significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (CS-PTSDS) in avalanche survivors (n = 399) 16 years after the disaster. Completed self-report questionnaires were received from 286 (72%) survivors. CS-PTSDS were assessed with the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale. Predictors of CS-PTSDS in a multivariate analysis were secondary sequelae factors of lack of social support (adjusted relative risk [RR], 2.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-6.13) and financial hardship in the aftermath of the trauma (adjusted RR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.16-5.26). In addition, the community factor of providing assistance in the aftermath of the avalanche (adjusted RR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.04-3.64) was inversely associated with CS-PTSDS. Screening for these factors may be useful in identifying those most vulnerable to developing chronic PTSD after this unique type of disaster.",58

Service members who undergo combat deployments are at increased risk for mental health and sleep difficulties. Bidirectional associations between sleep and mental health difficulties are routinely observed, but the directional association of these difficulties from one deployment to the next has not been addressed. The purpose of this study was to examine whether residual sleep problems or mental health difficulties after a 12-month period of reset operations following an initial deployment were associated with changes in sleep and mental health following a subsequent deployment. Methods Data from 74 U.S. Soldiers were case-matched across three time points. Participants were assessed 6 months (T1) and 12 months (T2) following an initial deployment. Participants were then assessed 3 months (T3) following a subsequent deployment. Symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties were assessed at all three time points. Results Cross-lagged hierarchical regression models revealed that residual sleep difficulties across the time points uniquely predicted later changes in PTSD and anxiety symptoms, but not depressive symptoms, following a subsequent deployment. Conversely, residual mental health difficulties were not unique predictors of later changes in sleep difficulties. Conclusion These findings suggest that higher levels of residual sleep difficulties 12 months following a prior deployment are associated with larger increases in mental health problems following a subsequent deployment. Moreover, and importantly, the converse association was not supported. Residual mental health difficulties prior to deployment were not associated with changes in sleep difficulties. These data provide a viable target for intervention during reset operations to mitigate mental health difficulties associated with combat deployments. They might also help inform return-to-duty decisions. Support N/A.",58

Designs and methods This descriptive and correlational study was conducted using the Child Post-Traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPTS-RI), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children-Trait Form (STAIC-Trait Form) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). The study sample included 1115 Syrian refugee children. Results The mean age of refugee children was 10.53 ± 2.79 years. Of them, 52% were males and 38% had no diseases while 74% were smokers and smoked 8.39 ± 6.85 cigarettes per day. The children's mean score on CPTS-RI, STAIC-Trait Form and CDI was found to be 60.59 ± 14.50, 54.11 ± 14.55 and 47.57 ± 10.97, respectively. The regression analysis revealed that anxiety and depression had a statistically significant association with post-traumatic stress. Conclusions The study findings revealed that refugee children have physical and psychosocial health problems and experience a high level of post-traumatic stress, depression and anxiety. Practice implications In this context, the study recommends that nursing practices should be developed considering that children may have mental health problems due to war.",58

National Guard members may be particularly at risk for mental disorders, given their dual role as citizen-soldiers and their increased involvement in combat deployments during recent conflicts. The Ohio Army National Guard Mental Health Initiative (OHARNG-MHI) was launched to assess the prevalence, incidence, and potential causes and consequences of mental disorders in this unique population. OHARNG-MHI is a decade-long dynamic cohort study that followed over 3,000 National Guard members yearly through structured telephone interviews. Findings thus far have applied a pre-, peri-, post-deployment framework, identifying factors throughout the life course associated with mental disorders, including childhood events and more recent events, both during and outside of deployment. An estimated 61% of participants had at least one mental disorder in their lifetime, the majority of which initiated prior to military service. Psychiatric comorbidity was common, as were alcohol use and stressful events. Latent class growth analyses revealed four distinct trajectory paths of both posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms across four years. Only 37% of soldiers with probable past-year mental disorders accessed mental health services in the subsequent year, with substance use disorders least likely to be treated. Strengths of this study include a large number of follow-up interviews, detailed data on both military and non-military experiences, and a clinical assessment subsample that assessed the validity of the telephone screening instruments. Findings, methods, and procedures of the study are discussed, and collaborations are welcome.",59

This study examines the lived experiences of burn patients and caregivers, the most challenging aspects of their recoveries, and factors that have assisted in recovery. This qualitative study was conducted in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa at a 900-bed district hospital. Participants (n = 35) included burn patients (n = 13) and caregivers (n = 22) after discharge. In-depth interviews addressed the recovery process after a burn injury. Data were coded using NVivo 12. Analysis revealed three major thematic categories. Coded data were triangulated to analyze caregiver and patient perspectives jointly. The participants’ lived experiences fell into three main categories: (1) psychological impacts of the burn, (2) enduring the transition into daily life, and (3) reflections on difficulties survivors face in returning for aftercare. The most notable discussions regarded stigma, difficulty accepting self-image, loss of relationships, returning to work, and barriers in receiving long-term aftercare at the hospital outpatient clinic. Patients and caregivers face significant adversities integrating into society. This study highlights areas in which burn survivors may benefit from assistance to inform future interventions and international health policy.",59

The current study aims to investigate the relationship between daily measured PTSD symptoms during an intensive six-day treatment program and overall post-treatment outcomes. The treatment program combines eye movement desensitization with reprocessing and prolonged exposure, as well as physical activity and psychoeducation. It was expected that for the entire duration of treatment, as well as the first half of the treatment, a greater decline in daily PTSD symptoms would be a predictor for a greater decline in PTSD symptoms at a four-week follow-up. Data from 109 PTSD-patients (87.2% female, mean age = 36.9, SD = 11.5) were used. PTSD symptoms were measured with the CAPS-5 and the self-reported PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Daily PTSD symptoms were measured with an abbreviated version of the PCL-5 (8-item PCL). Latent growth curve models were used to describe changes in daily PTSD symptoms and predict treatment outcome. Results show that a greater decline in daily PTSD symptoms measured by the 8-item PCL predicts better treatment outcome (CAPS-5 and PCL-5), but that a patient’s PTSD symptoms on the first day of treatment has no predictive effect. A decline in PTSD symptoms only during the first half of treatment was also found to predict treatment outcomes. Future research should be focused on replicating the results of the current study.",59

The public's responses to power outages provide valuable insights into their capacities of adapting crisis and an invaluable perspective to demonstrate community resilience. As social media has connected people in the community, the discussion on social media can reflect their responses as a criterion of resilience throughout power outages in a timely and effective manner. In the field of power outages, the potentials of social media data have only been investigated with recent advancements of big data techniques. Nonetheless, studies focusing on community resilience using social media data are quite limited. We filled this gap by introducing a novel and quantitative method to study the community resilience throughout power outages, based on a case study on the Manhattan blackout occurred in July 2019. The study examined community resilience from both mental and behavioral perspectives via sentiment analysis and behavior analysis. The sentiment analysis was used to track people's mental outlook and shape the overall mental status during and after this emergency. On the other side, six major patterns of behaviors were identified, and the behavioral index was defined to learn how the community responded to power outages amid the response and recovery periods. Both the mental and behavioral results reveal that New York City recovered at approximately one and a half hours after the blackout occurred, implying a strong community resilience to such short and emergent power outage events.",59

Does PE play a role in the association between exposure to political violence and posttraumatic stress? The current study aimed to examine whether such PE may help explain why exposure to political violence results in posttraumatic stress for some people but not others. Based on the conservation of resource theory, research has found that residents of some types of communities are less likely to suffer from posttraumatic stress when exposed to political violence, due to the economic and psychological resources these communities provide. Political efficacy, as an individual‐level factor that relates to the community, may help predict who will suffer more or less posttraumatic stress from exposure to political violence within a given community. Based on a panel study conducted immediately before and after the 2008–2009 Gaza conflict ( N = 650) and hierarchical linear modeling analyses, we found that type of community indeed moderated the association between exposure to political violence and posttraumatic stress, Δ‐2 log likelihood = 30.4, p &lt; .001. In addition, we found that PE mitigated the psychological distress resulting from exposure to political conflict in disadvantaged communities, Δ‐2 log likelihood = 22.8, p &lt; .001. This study not only further untangled the association between exposure and distress during times of war but also identified the role that governments can play in preventing conflict‐induced distress beyond offering physical protection.",59

Evidence regarding the patterns of IPV across time, and the associated long term course of depressive symptoms is lacking. The current study aimed to (a) identify patterns of physical and emotional IPV experienced by women over the 10 years since having their first child, and (b) identify trajectories depressive symptoms across the 10-year period for each pattern of IPV exposure. Data was drawn from the Mothers' and Young People's Study (MYPS), a longitudinal study of 1507 mothers and their first born child. Data was collected during pregnancy and at one, four, and ten years postpartum. Using Latent Class Analysis, four distinct classes of IPV were identified: (1) Minimal IPV, (2) Early IPV exposure, (3) Increasing IPV, and (4) Persistent IPV. Latent growth modelling revealed that all classes characterised by some IPV exposure experienced elevated trajectories of depressive symptoms in comparison to the minimal IPV class. Those experiencing increasing and persistent IPV experienced the most severe course of depressive symptoms.",59

This is the first multisample evaluation of the psychometric properties for a general trauma-related CSE measure.Results showed that a brief and parsimonious 9-item version of the CSE performed well across the samples with a robust factor structure; factor structure and factor loadings were similar across study samples.The 9-item scale CSE-T demonstrated measurement equivalence across samples indicating that the underlying concept of general posttraumatic CSE is organized in a similar manner in the different trauma-exposed groups. These results offer strong support for cross-event construct validity of the CSE-T scale. Associations of the CSE-T with important expected covariates showed significant evidence for convergent validity. Finally, discriminant validity was also supported. Replication of the factor structure, internal reliability, and other evidence for construct validity is a critical next step for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record",59

Historically, it has been defined as a trait, characteristic, or collection of resources that facilitates healthy adjustment to a potentially traumatic event (PTE) and has typically been measured at one point in time. More recently, it has been defined as an outcome, or a successful course of adaptation following exposure to a severe and overwhelming experience. Inherent in this definition is the expectation that a cross-sectional evaluation will fall short; if resilience is an adaptation to an experience, it must then unfold over time. Unfortunately, the absence of a single unifying paradigm of resilience has hindered progress in the field. In this review, we discuss the handful of characteristics that are most consistently linked to low levels of distress following exposure to a PTE and describe several prototypic trait resilience measures for adults. We also describe and critically evaluate research that has generated distinct typologies or groups with similar trajectories of adjustment following exposure to PTEs. Finally, we provide examples of several studies of interventions to promote resilience. Ultimately, for the field to advance, clinicians, researchers, and policy-makers need to isolate the factors that reliably promote a successful adjustment across a broad range of domains, including emotional, physical, and occupational functioning. Once known, prevention and intervention strategies need to be refined and tested so that suffering and dysfunction can be mitigated before chronic and debilitating distress become entrenched in those who do not recover on their own.

Research studies have yielded divergent findings regarding the effect of depression on PTSD treatment outcomes. The present study investigated the influence of pretreatment depression severity on PTSD and depression symptom trajectories among 85 older (i.e., ≥ 60 years) male veterans with military‐related PTSD who received either prolonged exposure or relaxation training as part of a randomized controlled trial. Participants were categorized as having no/mild depression ( n = 23) or moderate/severe depression ( n = 62). The PTSD Checklist (PCL‐S) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐9) were completed at pretreatment, each of 12 therapy sessions, posttreatment, and 6‐month follow‐up, for a total of up to 15 data points per participant. Multilevel modeling (MLM) was used to evaluate the impact of pretreatment depression severity on piecewise symptom trajectories (i.e., active treatment and follow‐up periods) over time and to determine whether treatment condition moderated the trajectories. The final MLM results showed significant main effects of depression severity on PCL‐S scores, B = 10.84, p = .043 and PHQ‐9 scores, B = 7.09, p = .001, over time. No significant interactions emerged for either the PCL‐S or PHQ‐9, indicating that although older veterans with more severe depression endorsed higher PTSD and depression scores across time, the symptom trajectories were not moderated by depression severity, treatment condition, or their interaction.",60

It is commonly accepted that a message about a child’s life-threatening disease might develop a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The aim of the research: to select and review publications related with post-traumatic stress symptoms, which affect parents, who have children with oncological diseases. Methodology: a systematic review. Results: the systematic review revealed the variety of valuation techniques used in scientific researches. The articles included in the systematic analysis show that post-traumatic stress symptoms are mostly evaluated according to the impact of event scale (IES-R) and PTSD checklist – civil version (PCL-C). Despite the benefits of longitudinal researches mentioned in many articles, many models are still based on the instantaneous tracking study. As per results of the systematic review, there is a wide range of factors that can affect the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms in parents who have children with oncological diseases. These are socio-demographic factors associated with the specifics of treatment, emotional state of children, traumatic experience and the coping strategies of parents, relationship between parents and children, etc. The cultural context is also important when analysing factors that might affect the development of PTSS. In order to help the parents who have children with oncological diseases function better, it is crucial to study the post-traumatic stress symptoms that occur as well as predisposed and protecting factors.",60

According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada (2016), the cost of this disaster was estimated at USD 3.6 billion in insured losses. Despite the fundamental role of resilience in the daily functioning of individuals in the form of a protective shield that ameliorates the devastating impact of disasters on their mental well-being, to date, the long-term impact of wildfires on resilience and its associated predictors of low resilience has not been well studied and evaluated. Objectives The study aimed to enhance the understanding of the psychological impact of wildfires through the evaluation of the prevalence and predictors of resilience among the affected residents of Fort McMurray five years after the devastating wildfires. Methods This study applied a cross-sectional survey design which was used to gather quantitative data through an online-based self-administered questionnaire. The surveys included standardized rating scales for resilience (BRS), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety disorder (GAD-7), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PCL-C) was used to measure the prevalence of resilience and its demographic, clinical, as well as wildfire-related predictors. The data collection spanned between April and June of 2021. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 and univariate analysis with done using a chi-squared test and binary logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 249 residents accessed the online survey and 186 completed the survey. Therefore, there was a response rate of 74.7%. Most of the respondents were females (85.5%, 159), above 40 years of age (81.6%, 80), employed (94.1%, 175), and in a relationship (71%, 132). The study identified two variables, thus having PTSD symptoms (OR = 2.85; 95% CI: 1.06–7.63), and the age of respondents significantly predicted low resilience in our sample. The prevalence of low resilience in our sample was found to be about 37.4%. Conclusions The study finding demonstrated that age and the presence of PTSD were the independent significant risk factors associated with low resilience in the affected population of Fort McMurray five years after the devastating wildfire disaster. This result further provides new information about the association between resilience, demographic, and clinical characteristics while adding to the rising body of evidence on the benefits of resilience in individuals during and after disasters.

The primary outcomes, clinician-rated severity of PTSD symptoms, and diagnostic status (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale; CAPS-IV) were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and at three and six months. Treatment response trajectories were identified and predictors of these trajectories explored.Results: Mixed model repeated measures analysis of CAPS-IV scores showed a baseline-to-posttreatment decrease in PTSD symptom severity (p < .001) that persisted during the three- and six-month follow-ups with large effect sizes (Cohen’s d > 1.2); 71% of the participants responded. None of the participants dropped out during the intensive phase and only 5% during the booster phase. Adverse events were extremely low and only a minority showed symptom exacerbation. Cluster analysis demonstrated four treatment response trajectories: Fast responders (13%), Slow responders (26%), Partial responders (32%), and Non-responders (29%). Living condition and between-session fear habituation were found to predict outcome. Participants living alone were more likely to belong to the Partial responders than to the Non-responders cluster, and participants showing more between-session fear habituation were more likely to belong to the Fast responders than to the Non-responders cluster.Conclusions: The results of this open study suggest that iPE can be effective in PTSD patients with multiple interpersonal trauma and after multiple previous treatment attempts.

Methods: Participants underwent a Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to assess the presence of PTSD following DSM-IV criteria during in-person interviews between December 2013 and April 2015. We defined sub-threshold PTSD as meeting criteria for two of three symptom dimensions: re-experiencing, avoidance, or hyper-arousal. Asthma control, acute asthma-related healthcare utilization, and asthma-related quality of life data were collected using validated scales. Unadjusted and multiple regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between sub-threshold PTSD and PTSD symptom domains with asthma morbidity measures. Results: Of the 181 WTC workers with asthma recruited into the study, 28% had PTSD and 25% had sub-threshold PTSD. Patients with PTSD showed worse asthma control, higher rates of inpatient healthcare utilization, and poorer asthma quality of life than those with sub-threshold or no PTSD. After adjusting for potential confounders, among patients not meeting the criteria for full PTSD, those presenting symptoms of re-experiencing exhibited poorer quality of life (p = 0.003). Avoidance was associated with increased acute healthcare use (p = 0.05). Sub-threshold PTSD was not associated with asthma morbidity (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Conclusions: There may be benefit in assessing asthma control in patients with sub-threshold PTSD symptoms as well as those with full PTSD to more effectively identify ongoing asthma symptoms and target management strategies.",60

Yet, the majority of exposed individuals are resilient, highlighting the importance of identifying underlying factors that contribute to outcomes. Methods The current study was part of a larger prospective study of children in Long Island, New York (n = 260). At age 9, children viewed unpleasant and pleasant images while the late positive potential (LPP), an event-related potential component that reflects sustained attention toward salient information, was measured. Following the event-related potential assessment, Hurricane Sandy, the second costliest hurricane in United States history, hit the region. Eight weeks after the hurricane, mothers reported on exposure to hurricane-related stress and children’s internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Symptoms were reassessed 8 months after the hurricane. Results The LPP predicted both internalizing and externalizing symptoms after accounting for prehurricane symptomatology and interacted with stress to predict externalizing symptoms. Among children exposed to higher levels of hurricane-related stress, enhanced neural reactivity to unpleasant images predicted greater externalizing symptoms 8 weeks after the disaster, while greater neural reactivity to pleasant images predicted lower externalizing symptoms. Moreover, interactions between the LPP and stress continued to predict externalizing symptoms 8 months after the hurricane. Conclusions Results indicate that heightened neural reactivity and attention toward unpleasant information, as measured by the LPP, predispose children to psychiatric symptoms when exposed to higher levels of stress related to natural disasters, while greater reactivity to and processing of pleasant information may be a protective factor.",60

Participants: Two consecutive years of entering freshman (Year 1 (Y1) N = 169, Year 2 (Y2) N = 94) were surveyed over time: Y1 in October 2012 and March 2013, and Y2 in October 2013 and August 2014. During Y2, several collective traumas occurred, impacting the campus community and providing a stark comparison. Methods: Online surveys measuring predictors at the start of each year and adjustment at the end of each year. Results: Hope was the only significant predictor of adjustment when included in a regression model with depression symptoms in Y1, and with depression symptoms, baseline posttraumatic stress symptoms, and traumatic exposure in Y2. Conclusions: Fostering hope may promote college adjustment, regardless of collective traumas that might occur on campus.",60

Given the demonstrated efficacy of exercise for depression treatment, we examined if exercise buffers against the risk of developing psychiatric symptoms following life stressors. 1405 participants (61% female) from a longitudinal panel cohort experienced disability onset (43%), bereavement (26%), heart attack (20%), divorce (11%), and job loss (3%). They reported time spent exercising and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale) across three time points collected in two-year intervals: T0 (pre-stressor), T1 (acutely post-stressor), and T2 (post-stressor). Participants were classified in previously identified heterogeneous depression trajectories pre- to post-life stressor: resilient (69%), emerging (11.5%), chronic (10%), and improving (9.5%). Multinomial logistic regression found that more T0 exercise predicted likelihood of classification in resilient versus other groups (all p<.02). Controlling for covariates, only the higher likelihood of classification in resilient versus improving remained (p=.03). Follow-up repeated measures general linear model (GLM) assessed whether trajectory was associated with exercise at each time, controlling for covariates. GLM indicated significant within-subjects effects for time (p=.016, partial η2=.003) and time*trajectory (p=.020, partial η2=.005) on exercise and significant between-subjects effects of trajectory (p<.001, partial η2=.016) and all covariates. The resilient group showed consistent high exercise levels. The improving group had consistent moderate exercise. The emerging and chronic groups were associated with lower exercise post-stressor. Pre-stressor exercise may buffer against depression and ongoing exercise may be associated with lower depression levels following a major life stressor.",60

Their adverse effects can transcend generations. Stressors can include natural disasters or political stressors such as conflict and/or migration. Considerable evidence has accumulated demonstrating the adverse effects of natural disasters on pregnancy outcomes and developmental trajectories. However, beyond tracking outcomes, the time has arrived for gathering more information related to identifying mechanisms, predicting risk and developing stress-reducing and resilience-building interventions to improve outcomes. Further, we need to learn how to encapsulate both the quantitative and qualitative information available and share it with communities and authorities to mitigate the adverse developmental effects of future disasters, conflicts and migrations. This article briefly reviews prenatal maternal stress and identifies three contemporary situations (wildfire in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada; hurricane Harvey in Houston, USA and transgenerational and migrant stress in Pforzheim, Germany) where current studies are being established by Canadian investigators to test an intervention. The experiences from these efforts are related along with attempts to involve communities in the studies and share the new knowledge to plan for future disasters or tragedies.",60

Participants completed measures of PTSD symptoms, PTG, and trait resilience at 12, 18, and 24 months after the Wenchuan earthquake. Results showed that after adjusting PTG at wave 1, PTSD symptoms at wave 1 were positively and significantly related to PTG at wave 2 for low-resilience individuals, but not for individuals with the other two levels (middle and high) of trait resilience. After adjusting PTSD symptoms at wave 1, PTG at wave 1 was positively and significantly related to PTSD symptoms at wave 2 for middle-resilience individuals, but not for individuals with the other two levels (low and high) of trait resilience. No other cross-lagged correlations were significant. Implications of the results for psychological service providers are discussed.",60
https://openalex.org/W2327068493,10.1037/tra0000116,The role of appraisals and coping in predicting posttraumatic stress following pediatric injury.,"Given the millions of children who experience potentially traumatic injuries each year and the need to maximize emotional and physical health outcomes following pediatric injury, the current study examined the individual and collective contributions of the malleable variables of appraisals and coping in predicting posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in children following injury.This study combined data from 3 prospective investigations of recovery from pediatric injury (N = 688) in which children ages 8-17 years were recruited shortly after an injury (within 4 weeks). At baseline (T1), children completed measures of their threat appraisals of the injury event and PTSS. Six to twelve weeks later (T2), children completed a measure of coping and PTSS. Finally, PTSS was assessed again 6 months post-injury (T3).Structural equation modeling analyses provide evidence that appraisals and coping contribute to PTSS. Furthermore, results suggest that escape coping mediates the relationship between threat appraisals and PTSS.Early interventions designed to prevent or reduce PTSS after pediatric injury may be more successful if they primarily target modifying escape coping behaviors. To best inform clinical practice, future research should examine factors influencing the development of children's appraisals and coping behaviors in the context of potentially traumatic events.

We compared sociodemographic, social, and individual characteristics and perceived the quality of life between participants with and without depression. Thirty-seven refugees (28.2%) had clinically significant depressive symptoms. The refugees with depression were younger (t = 2.67; p = 0.009), more likely to be male (χ² = 6.98; p = 0.009), and more likely to have a Chinese father (χ² = 9.05; p = 0.003) than those without depression. The refugees with depression had lower levels of psychological social support (t = 2.96; p = 0.004) and resilience (t = 4.24; p < 0.001) and higher levels of alcohol problems (t = -2.08; p = 0.043), aggression (t = -3.15; p = 0.003), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; t = -2.89; p = 0.004). They also reported lower levels of life satisfaction (t = 3.31; p = 0.001) and had a more negative view of their future (t = 2.68; p = 0.010). Interventions to increase resilience, to decrease the impact of traumatic events, and to provide psychological support may be helpful for North Korean adolescent refugees at risk of depression.",61

We examined the role of social cohesion as a component of vulnerability and resilience to the psychological distress of flooding. Methods. A survey collected data from 2238 individuals living in flood-affected areas of England (South Yorkshire and Worcestershire) in 2007. We used Bayesian structural equation modeling to assess factors relating to the latent variables of resilience (years in area, family nearby, and social cohesion) and vulnerability (disruption of essential services, flood risk, and previous flood experience). Results. Flooding was strongly associated with poor mental health; however, resilience factors (associated with the ability to cope with natural disasters), but not vulnerability, were strongly associated with a reduction in psychological distress. Conclusions. Resilience and social cohesion were important influences on the risk of developing poor mental health following flooding. Increasing resilience of communities by strengthening social cohesion through measures that increase civic participation and changing land use should be considered as potentially inexpensive and effective defenses against avoidable mental harm that will result from increased climate instability.",61
https://openalex.org/W3000752691,,Maternal and paternal depressive symptoms and children's emotional problems at the age of 2 and 5 years: a longitudinal study,"Background Maternal and paternal depressive symptoms are related to children's emotional problems, but their combined effect remains unclear. Here, we constructed four parental longitudinal depressive symptom trajectory groups and studied their associations with children's emotional problems at the age of 2 and 5 years. Methods We did an assessment of maternal and paternal depressive symptoms (gestational week 32, as well as 3, 8 and 24 months postnatally) and children's emotional problems at ages two (N = 939) and five (N = 700) in the CHILD-SLEEP cohort. Three separate maternal and paternal depressive symptom trajectories based on latent profile analysis were combined to form four parental depressive symptom trajectory groups. We compared groups with a general linear model, with children's emotional (total, internalizing and externalizing) - problem scores serving as the dependent variables. Results At both ages, combined parental depressive symptom trajectories were associated with children's emotional problems: effect sizes were medium for total and small for other domains. According to post hoc comparisons, children whose mothers or both parents had persistent depressive symptoms had significantly more total, externalizing and internalizing problems than did children who had neither parent nor only the father showing depressive symptoms. A higher (and persistent) level of maternal depressive symptoms was related to a higher level of these children's emotional problems, a pattern not evident with paternal depressive symptoms. In all analyses, the interaction effect was nonsignificant between parental trajectories and child gender. Conclusions Findings suggest that an absence of depressive symptoms in their fathers cannot compensate for the adverse effects of maternal depressive symptoms upon their children. Moreover, paternal depressive symptoms alone do not lead to increased risk for emotional problems in these 2- and 5-year-old children. In contrast, even subclinical levels of maternal depressive symptoms in late pregnancy are associated with increased risk for their children's experiencing internalizing and externalizing emotional problems.",61

A literature review,"Posttraumatic growth (PTG), the process of developing beyond one’s previous level of well-being after having experienced an adverse event, is an extensively studied and well researched concept of positive psychology. Nevertheless, there are calls for more specialized knowledge about mechanisms that are at hand in different sample groups that face adversity (Morris, Shakespeare‐Finch, Rieck & Newbery, 2005; Zoellner & Maercker, 2006). One such specialized group are military members who are frequently faced with potential traumatizing events (Suliman et al., 2009). This literature review examines which variables affect PTG in combat veterans and answers the overall question to what extent PTG affects posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) -symptoms in combat veterans.
The search for appropriate, empirical studies resulted in a total of 19 articles, which surveyed the effects of PTG on PTSD in mainly male and Caucasian combat veterans. All of these studies assessed PTG and PTSD via self-assessment. This proved to be a major drawback in these studies. Next to that, the review indicated two different relationships of PTG and PTSD in combat veterans. Most of the studies (n=13) proved a negative effect and the minority (n=5) a curvilinear. Furthermore, interventions that supported PTG in combat veterans turned out to have a better effect when taking place after or before the deployment. The results of the 19 reviewed studies formed the basis for the creation of the ‘PTG-ComVet’-model, which is the first of its kind. This predictive model consists out of the following seven groups of variables: (1)demographics, (2)military factors, (3)emotions, (4)cognitions, (5)pathologies, (6)individual factors and (7)social factors. These variables predict PTG at three different points of time: before, during and after the deployment. Including this time aspect and solely significant variables for developing PTG in combat veterans, the model receives significance for scientific research and practical treatment. 
	To create a better understanding about the meaning and the significance of the obtained findings, the results are finally discussed. In bringing together current and former scientific findings, this discussion enabled the creation of ten implications for future research. These implications represent possible directions for future research.

In a quasi-experimental design, we prospectively examined associations between disaster-related prenatal stress, maternal mental health symptoms, and infant temperament outcomes. Mothers who were pregnant during Hurricane Harvey (N = 527) reported on objective hardships (e.g., loss of belongings or income, evacuation, home flooding) related to the storm and subsequent mental health symptoms (anxiety/depression, posttraumatic stress) across time. At a postpartum assessment, mothers reported on their infant's temperament (negative affect, positive affect, orienting/regulatory capacity). Greater objective hardship indirectly predicted higher levels of infant orienting/regulatory capacity through its association with increased maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms. Greater objective hardship also indirectly predicted higher levels of infant negative affect through its association with increased maternal anxiety/depression symptoms across time. Our findings suggest a psychological mechanism linking prenatal stress with specific temperamental characteristics via maternal mental health symptoms. Findings point to the importance of high-quality assessment and mental health services for vulnerable women and young children.",61

The sample was composed of an approximately even split of male (51.2%) and female (48.8%) participants who ranged in age from 18 to 60 years. The PMHSS is a 21‐item measure that was designed to assess the impact of specific medical stressors that military healthcare providers may encounter while deployed. An exploratory factor analysis of the PMHSS revealed the presence of two distinct factors: trainable and futility stressors. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that a bifactor model best represented the data, with all items loading higher on the general factor relative to their specific subscale factors. Evidence of partial scalar invariance by gender was found. The PMHSS was significantly correlated with several convergent measures, including assessments of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression severity, distress due to both combat exposure and general deployment‐related concerns, and positive affect, r s = .30–.59. PMHSS scores were more strongly correlated with PTSD and depression in women than in men, and they provided incremental validity in predicting convergent measures over and above other related constructs. Healthcare–specific stressors are an understudied area, and this study provides new insights into how deployment‐related caregiving stress may impact deployed military medical personnel independently of the impact of combat experiences.",61

We used latent class growth analysis to identify the longitudinal trajectories of grief assessed using the Inventory for Complicated Grief. To validate the trajectory that corresponded to prolonged grief, we examined the baseline predictors of these trajectories and their relationship with functional impairment.We found three distinct trajectories of grief reactions. One of these trajectories (13.8%) showed high and sustained grief reactions that persisted for almost 7.5 years after the death. Participants with prolonged grief showed greater functional impairment [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70 to -0.97; p = 0.02] and higher self-reported depression (RRR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.96; p = 0.001) than participants whose grief reactions subsided over time. The original PCBD (requiring 6 criterion C symptoms) criteria correctly identified cases (57.9-94.7%) with perfect specificity (100%) but low to high sensitivity (5.6-81.3%); however, its sensitivity increased when revising criterion C to require ⩾3 (45.5-94.1%). The dimensional approach showed high sensitivity (0.50-1) and specificity (0.787-0.97).We recommend revisions to the PCBD criteria, which are overly restrictive and may exclude cases with clinically significant grief-related distress and impairment. In the meantime, clinicians need to monitor grief symptoms over time using available dimensional approaches to reduce the burden of grief.",61

However, current measures of such reactions overlap conceptually and do not clearly identify distinct peritraumatic processes. It is not known which processes are uniquely associated with PTSD. We investigated the factor structure of six standard peritraumatic measures and their relationship with the four Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM–5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) PTSD symptom clusters. Measures were administered to 308 earthquake survivors with high levels of exposure to traumatic events. Items comprising the six measures were investigated using exploratory structural equation modeling, which identified five peritraumatic response factors. Items from most measures loaded on multiple factors. Mental defeat and somatoform dissociation significantly predicted all PTSD symptom clusters. Cognitive overload significantly predicted intrusions, avoidance, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. Immobility significantly predicted intrusions and avoidance, whereas distress significantly predicted negative alterations in cognition and mood and alterations in arousal and reactivity. Because of the key role such reactions play in the development of PTSD, the findings are likely to benefit the study of etiological mechanisms, the prediction of those at greatest risk, and the design of preventative interventions.

This study examined the relationship of distress associated with routine activities and perceived safety to psychological and behavioral responses. Methods Participants were 1238 residents of the Washington, DC, metropolitan area (aged 18 to 90 years, mean=41.7 years) who completed an Internet survey including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and items pertaining to distress related to routine activities, perceived safety, and alcohol use. Data were collected at one time point approximately 3 weeks after the first sniper shooting and before apprehension of the suspects. Relationships of distress and perceived safety to post-traumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and increased alcohol use were examined by using linear and logistic regression analyses. Results Approximately 8% of the participants met the symptom criteria for probable post-traumatic stress disorder, 22% reported mild to severe depression, and 4% reported increased alcohol use during the attacks. Distress related to routine activities and perceived safety were associated with increased post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms and alcohol use. Conclusion Distress and perceived safety are associated with specific routine activities and both contribute to psychological and behavioral responses during a terrorist attack. These findings have implications for targeted information dissemination and risk communication by community leaders. ( Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness . 2015;9:509–515)",61

Method First, we conducted an online survey and recruited 500 workers diagnosed with depression or adjustment disorder to investigate what type of stress they experienced within six months before onset. Second, we conducted another online survey and recruited 767 participants who experienced some form of work-related stress. All the participants were classified into four groups by whether or not they were diagnosed with depression and whether or not they quit their jobs due to work-related stress. We used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) to measure psychological injury caused by work-related stressful events and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 to assess the severity of depression. Results In study 1, 62.4% of workers diagnosed with depression or adjustment disorder experienced work-related stress within six months before onset. In study 2, the IES-R mean scores were 40.7 (SD = 23.1) for Group A (workers with depression and quit their jobs) and 36.67 (SD = 23.4) for Group B (workers with depression but stayed at their jobs), with both exceeding the cut-off point (24/25) of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), while the mean score of Group C (workers who did not have depression but quit their jobs because of work-related stress) was 20.74 (SD = 21.2), and it was 13.89 (SD = 17.4) for Group D (workers who had work-related stress but stayed at their jobs), with both of them below the cut-off point of PTSD. The total scores of IES-R of Group A and Group B were significantly higher than those of Group C and Group D( p &lt; 0.001). There was a significant positive correlation between the scores of IES-R and PHQ-9 for all four groups ( r = 0.708). Conclusions This study suggests that it is necessary to measure not only depressive symptoms but also the level of psychological injury resulting from stressful events in the workplace to assess workers with depression.",61

Childbirth has only recently been recognised by perinatal psychiatrists as a triggering event fulfilling the PTSD exposure criteria. This enabled the proper identification of peripartum patients with PTSD and stimulated research focusing on prevention strategies, identification of risk factors and potential treatment interventions. Unfortunately, inconsistencies among definitions and measurements of traumatic stress (full compared with partial or subsyndromal PTSD) have challenged interpretation and generalised application of the available data. Furthermore, the topic of peripartum PTSD—although widely recognised in nursing, midwifery and psychological journals—has yet to be well described in clinical obstetric and anaesthesia journals. This review examines all pertinent literature on this topic and focuses on several aspects of peripartum PTSD, notably: predisposing risk factors for the development of a traumatic birth experience and risk factors for the development of PTSD after a traumatic birth; intrapartum precipitating events associated with the development of postpartum PTSD; the impact of a traumatic birth and postpartum PTSD on maternal and neonatal physical and psychological health; and possible management strategies that can be used at any time across the peripartum period.Clinical scenarioJade, a nulliparous woman, presented for an induction of labour at 39 weeks. She prepared a birth plan with her birth companion and communicated with her obstetrician that she wanted minimal interventions. Contrary to her preferences, she underwent a prolonged induction with misoprostol, a Foley bulb, oxytocin and rupture of membranes. After 36 h of labour, Jade requested epidural analgesia, and although she requested that no students perform the regional block, a trainee attempted and had difficulties. The second provider was successful. Over the next several hours she called out at least twice stating that her contractions were painful. Interventions were not completely effective in addressing the inadequacies of her epidural analgesia. Jade went for a non-urgent Caesarean section after a failed 3-day induction, and despite communicating to the team that she felt pain when they tested the block, they started the surgery. The anaesthesia team did not appreciate her perceived level of pain and failed to provide effective alternative anaesthetic options until after the delivery of her baby. Her subjective negative appraisal of the overall birth experience, the lack of effective communication with providers and severe intraoperative pain all contributed to the development of postpartum PTSD.

The anaesthesia team did not appreciate her perceived level of pain and failed to provide effective alternative anaesthetic options until after the delivery of her baby. Her subjective negative appraisal of the overall birth experience, the lack of effective communication with providers and severe intraoperative pain all contributed to the development of postpartum PTSD. Postpartum PTSD occurs in approximately 4% of postpartum patients overall.2Dikmen-Yildiz P.D. Ayers S. Phillips L.

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) may contribute to postpartum PTSD. Obstetric haemorrhage is a recognised cause of physical maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, there are few quality studies exploring the possible effect of severe maternal haemorrhage on maternal emotional and psychological health. The California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) has recognised the risk for emotional trauma and published recommendations (CMQCC Task Force, Stanford California, USA,Toolkit Version 2.0) based primarily on patient narratives discussing perceptions and experiences surrounding a PPH. A recent review article examined the existing literature on the associations between PPH and PTSD, and between emergency peripartum hysterectomy (EPH) and PTSD.12Zaat T.R. van Steijn M.E. de Haan-Jebbink J.M. et al.Posttraumatic stress disorder related to postpartum haemorrhage: a systematic review.Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 2018; 22: 214-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (21) Google Scholar Only seven articles were included, and a meta-analysis could not be performed because of the heterogeneity of studies. The authors concluded that there may be an association between PPH and PTSD, and EPH and PTSD; but, these associations must be interpreted with caution because of the small number of quality studies. One qualitative study examined patients' experiences after EPH, and—although not structured to assess specifically for PTSD—provides important insight into the emotional needs of these patients.13de la Cruz C.Z. Coulter M. O'Rourke K. Mbah A.K. Salihu H.M. Post-traumatic stress disorder following emergency peripartum hysterectomy.Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2016; 294 (2016): 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar Seven major themes were identified after an EPH: (i) fear; (ii) pain; (iii) the need for information; (iv) numbness (emotional); (v) the need for compassion, attentiveness and sensitivity; (vi) bonding; and (vii) separation from infants. The authors also found that psychological upset occurred after the event, and symptoms of severe emotional upset were often delayed beyond 3 months. ICU admission is a possible consequence of a severe PPH or EPH, and the authors noted that although ICU admission in the general population is a known risk for PTSD, it is unclear if it increases the risk for postpartum PTSD after a PPH or EPH. Regardless of the clinical outcome of a PPH, it is recommended, in accordance with NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines, that signs and symptoms of PTSD after any severe maternal morbidity ‘should be monitored over time to ensure timely and effective mental health treatment’.11Futura M. Sandall J. Bick D. A systematic review of the relationship between severe maternal morbidity and post-traumatic stress disorder.BMC Pregnancy Childb. 2012; 12: 125Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar The relationship between early pregnancy loss (EPL)—miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy—and the development of posttraumatic stress has also been examined.14Farren J. Jalmbrant M. Ameye L. et al.Post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression following miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy: a prospective cohort study.BMJ Open. 2016; 6e011864Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar The authors conducted a prospective pilot study using surveys to assess PTSD and anxiety and depression at 1, 3 and 9 months after an EPL. They found that 39% of their study participants met criteria for probable moderate–severe PTSD at 3 months, and that 20% met the criteria for moderate–severe anxiety compared with controls. Interestingly, they also found higher levels of PTSD symptoms in women who experienced an ectopic pregnancy vs those with a miscarriage. Such a high incidence of probable PTSD in this high-risk cohort supports the recognition of EPL as a risk factor and possible point for intervention to mitigate the development and symptom severity of PTSD. It is widely recognised that awareness under general anaesthesia contributes to the development of PTSD. However, there is scant research addressing specific anaesthesia-related causes of postpartum PTSD. One study specifically examined the role of anaesthetic complications as an independent variable in the development of PTSD.7Lopez U. Meyer M. Loures V. et al.Post-traumatic stress disorder in parturients delivering by caesarean section and the implication of anaesthesia: a prospective cohort study.Health Qual Life Outcome. 2017; 15: 118Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar The authors found that anaesthetic complications were significant predictors of postpartum PTSD and PTSD profile (clinically significant PTSD symptomatology but not meeting full criteria). The types of complications examined were severe nausea and vomiting; failed spinal/epidural anaesthesia leading to intraoperative pain requiring rescue medications; unintentional dural puncture followed by severe postpartum postdural puncture headache; traumatic needle insertion with pain, residual cutaneous haematoma or both; and neurological injuries (central or lower extremity motor and sensory dysfunction linked to regional anaesthesia.) Interestingly, the type of anaesthesia (general vs regional); the amount of anaesthesia information given before, during or after the procedure; and the training level of anaesthesia provider was not significant in predicting acute PTSD or a PTSD profile in the postpartum period. Pain in labour has been identified in several studies as a significant predictor of PTSD.9Soet J.E. Brack G.A. DiIorio C. Prevalence and predictors of women's experience of psychological trauma during childbirth.Birth. 2003; 30: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar Although pain is almost universally inherent to the birthing process and not a specific anaesthesia-related cause of psychological trauma, the pain of childbirth has many implications for the anaesthesia provider. One study examined if the use of epidural analgesia for the management of labour pain could decrease the incidence of postpartum depression (PPD) and found that its use was associated with a decreased risk.15Ding T. Wang D. Qu Y. Chen Q. Zhu S. Zhu S. Epidural labour analgesia is associated with a decreased risk of postpartum depression: a prospective cohort study.Anesth Analg. 2014; 119: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar One important limitation in this study was that no assessment for the presence of depression was done before birth, therefore complicating postpartum analysis. Although the authors did not assess specifically for PTSD risk, several associations can be made as PPD and PTSD are frequently comorbidities in the postpartum period.5Ayers S. Bond R. Bertullies S. Wijma K.

The management of anaesthesia for pregnant patients with pre-existing PTSD is also not well defined in the literature, and evidence-based recommendations are lacking. One case report described the anaesthetic management of a non-obstetric patient who had developed PTSD from intraoperative awareness in a previous surgery.17Mashour G.A. Jiang Y. Osterman J.

Another paper discussed perioperative implications of PTSD in the general population and suggested the following as part of the anaesthetic plan: focus on managing comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and mental health issues; multimodal pain strategies; avoidance of anaesthetic drugs that may negatively interact with medications used for PTSD; establishment of trust with the entire operating team; calm, slow and quiet approaches to the patient; and cautious use of benzodiazepines.18Wofford K.

Classic Day Publishing, Seattle, WA2004Google Scholar Factors that influence a patient's overall subjective birth experience include wanting control over the exposure of their bodies, fear of restraints and oxygen masks in the operating theatre, nausea and vomiting, and separation from loved ones for procedures. Negative language and perceived lack of support from medical personnel have also been mentioned as stressors. One qualitative study examining women's perceptions showed that even in emergency situations women had clear memories of what their providers said, and women felt ‘more positive about their care when they were given an explanation by health professionals… and a rationale for their medical procedure’.21Futura M.

Conversely, if women felt ‘isolated, ignored, treated inadequately, impersonally or unequally, or not listened to’, they recalled feeling more distressed and frustrated. These negative emotions compounded the overall negative appraisal of the birth experience. Thus, addressing the emotional needs of patients early in the experience via compassionate and respectful communication may help to mitigate a negative birth experience and decrease the subsequent risk for the development of PTSD.6Andersen L.B.

The association between PTSD and preterm delivery (PTD) has been made by several authors. One prospective study establishes a possible association between pre-existing PTSD and PTD between 34 and 37 weeks of gestation.22Rogal S.S. Poschman K. Belanger K. et al.Effects of posttraumatic stress disorder on pregnancy outcomes.J Affect Disord. 2007; 102: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar The authors found a stronger association between minor depressive disorder and low birth weight. Other research demonstrated an almost four-fold increased risk of PTD in patients with coexisting PTSD and major depressive episodes.23Yonkers K.A. Smith M.V. Forray A. et al.Pregnant women with posttraumatic stress disorder and risk of preterm birth.JAMA Psychiatry. 2014; 71: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar A suggested mechanism for this phenomenon includes dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis that results in increases in maternal and fetal cortisol. The increase in fetal cortisol then stimulates the fetal adrenal gland to secrete oestriol, which is postulated to influence factors responsible for the initiation of labour. Furthermore, the authors theorised that chronic stress states lead to an increase in adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) concentrations contributing to chronic vasoconstriction, increased uterine artery resistance and the development of fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia, both of which are associated with PTD. The authors also mentioned other stress-related effects including decreases in immune function and risk of bacterial vaginosis resulting in PTD. Although not directly linked to PTD, sleep disturbances and alterations in eating patterns caused by chronic stress can create suboptimal conditions for pregnancy.23Yonkers K.A. Smith M.V.

A growing body of literature has employed latent class analysis (LCA) to disentangle the complex structure underlying PTS symptomatology, distinguishing between homogeneous subgroups based on PTS presentations. So far, little is known about subgroups or classes of ASD reactions in trauma-exposed children.Objective: Our study aimed to identify latent classes of ASD symptoms in children exposed to a single-incident PTE and to identify predictors of class membership (gender, age, cultural background, parental education, trauma type, and trauma history).Method: A sample of 2287 children and adolescents (5–18 years) was derived from the Prospective studies of Acute Child Trauma and Recovery (PACT/R) Data Archive, an international archive including studies from the USA, UK, Australia, and Switzerland. LCA was used to determine distinct subgroups based on ASD symptoms. Predictors of class membership were examined using a three-step approach.Results: Our LCA yielded a three-class solution: low (42%), intermediate (43%) and high (15%) ASD symptom severity that differed in terms of impairment and number of endorsed ASD symptoms. Compared to the low symptoms class, children in the intermediate or high severity class were more likely to be of female gender, be younger of age, have parents who had not completed secondary education, and be exposed to a road traffic accident or interpersonal violence (vs. an unintentional injury).Conclusions: These findings provide new information on children at risk for ASD after single-incident trauma, based on a unique set of international data. Classifying children based on latent symptom profiles helps to identify target groups for prevention and intervention after exposure to a PTE.",61

Participants were 511 Palestinian mothers from the Gaza Strip who reported exposure to current war trauma (WT), past childhood emotional (CEA) and physical abuse, socioeconomic status (SES), prenatal mental health problems (posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms), and perceived stress during their secondtrimester of pregnancy as well as infant stress regulation at 4 months. While all trauma types were associated with high levels of prenatal symptoms, CEA had the most wide-ranging effects and was uniquely associated with depression symptoms. Concerning infant stress regulation, mothers' CEA predicted negative affectivity, but only among mothers with low WT. Against hypothesis, the effects of maternal trauma on infant stress regulation were not mediated by mental health symptoms. Mothers' higher SES was associated with better infant stress regulation whereas infant prematurity and male sex predisposed for difficulties. Our findings suggest that maternal childhood abuse, especially CEA, should be a central treatment target among war-exposed families. Cumulated psychosocial stressors might increase the risk for transgenerational problems.",61

The hurricane contributed to the loss of housing, power, family and friends, and sense of security. This study aimed to identify the predictors of Puerto Ricans' perceived stress changes and mental health as self-reported after Hurricane Maria. Methods: Data collected by Kaiser Foundation-Washington Post in 2018 were obtained and analyzed using SAS v9.4 complex survey procedures. After the population weight was applied, multinomial logistic regressions were employed to identify predictors of participants' perceived stress changes and self-reported level of mental health. Results: Those whose general stress level was reported as worse after Hurricane Maria were more likely to have reported having generally poor mental health (OR 20.67; 95% CI 95% 8.60–49.69) and to have been impacted by the hurricane in various ways (OR 1.85; 95% [1.21, 2.85]).Those who reported their general level of mental health as poor were more likely to report their general stress level as worse (OR 10.54; 95% CI [4.06–27.37]), and reported having to leave or evacuate as a result of Hurricane Maria (OR 2.44; 95% CI [1.20–5.65]). Discussion: A significant effect was shown for those who reported worse stress levels than those with better stress levels after the hurricane, and for those who reported good, fair, or poor general mental health. Conclusion: Owing to the impact of environmental disaster and current pandemic crisis on Puerto Rican citizens, it is imperative for both local and federal governments to enact plans to lessen resident mental health burden to reassure and facilitate access to mental health services after natural disasters.",61

Prior mTBI, severity and type of injury (blast vs. non-blast), and baseline psychiatric illness are thought to impact mTBI outcomes. It is unclear if the severity of pre-morbid PTS/PTSD is a risk factor of post-injury levels of PTS and mTBI symptoms. The objective of the study was to examine predictors of post-injury PTS/PTSD, including pre-morbid PTS symptoms, and physical and cognitive symptoms in the sub-acute phase (1 week-3 months) following an acute mTBI. A retrospective review of medical records was performed of 276 servicemen assigned to the United States Army Special Operations Command referred for mTBI evaluation between December 2009 and March 2011. Post-Concussion Symptom Scale and PTSD Checklist scores were captured pre- and post-injury. A total of 276 records were reviewed. Pre-morbid and post-injury data were available for 91% (251/276). Of the 54% (136/251) of personnel with mTBI, 29% (39/136) had positive radiology findings and 11% (15/136) met criteria for clinical PTS symptoms at baseline. Logistic regression analysis found baseline PTS symptoms predicted personnel who met clinical levels of PTSD. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that baseline PTS (p = 0.001), baseline mTBI symptoms (p = 0.001), and positive radiology (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography) findings for complicated mTBI (p = 0.02) accurately identified personnel with clinical levels of PTSD following mTBI. Years of military service, combat deployment status, age, and injury mechanism (blast vs. non-blast) were not associated with increased risk of PTS following mTBI. Pre-morbid PTS symptoms are associated with an increased risk for clinical levels of PTS following a subsequent mTBI. Symptom severity and positive radiologic findings may amplify this risk. At-risk personnel may benefit from early identification and intervention.",62

This study examined the network structure of PTSD symptoms in a sample of war-affected youth and compared the symptom networks of children and adolescents.The overall sample comprised 2007 youth (6-18 years old) living in Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Palestine, Tanzania, and Uganda amid or close to war and armed conflict. Youth reported their PTSD symptoms using a self-report questionnaire in Palestine and structured clinical interviews in all other countries. We computed the networks of the overall sample and of two sub-samples of 412 children (6-12 years) and 473 adolescents (13-18 years) and compared the structure and global connectivity of symptoms among children and adolescents.In both the overall sample and the sub-samples, re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms were most strongly connected. The adolescents' network had a higher global connectivity of symptoms than the children's network. Hyperarousal symptoms and intrusions were more strongly connected among adolescents compared to children.The findings lend support to a universal concept of PTSD among youth characterized by core deficits in fear processing and emotion regulation. However, different symptoms may be particularly important in different developmental stages, with avoidance and dissociative symptoms dominating in childhood and intrusions and hypervigilance gaining importance in adolescence. Stronger symptom connections may render adolescents more vulnerable to the persistence of symptoms.",62

Mothers' trauma history and PTSD symptoms were assessed; Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was conducted from these measures to identify distinct classes. Children reported violence exposure and completed a differential fear conditioning task using fear-potentiated startle (FPS) responses to conditioned danger (CS+) and safety (CS-) signals.Four classes of maternal trauma history and PTSD symptoms emerged: 1) Lower Trauma, 2) Moderate Trauma, 3) High Sexual Abuse, and 4) High Trauma and PTSD Symptoms. Children's FPS to CS + and CS- were tested with maternal class as the between-subjects factor. FPS to the danger signal was not significantly different across maternal classes, but FPS to safety (CS-) was significantly higher for the Lower Trauma and High Trauma and PTSD Symptoms classes than either the Moderate Trauma or the High Sexual Abuse classes.Results indicate that maternal trauma impacts children's ability to modulate fear responses in the presence of a safety signal, independent of the children's own trauma exposure. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that children's fear inhibition is impacted by maternal trauma exposure. Prior studies have linked fear inhibition to mental health outcomes, highlighting the need to understand intergenerational modulation of fear learning and physiology.",62

Increased drinking was not predicted by severity of disaster exposure, post-traumatic stress, or measures of psychological functioning. Reduced alcohol consumption was predicted by younger age and social withdrawal, but not by any of the other study variables.Our findings indicate that the tsunami experience had only minor effects on alcohol consumption, in contrast to some studies suggesting a relationship between trauma exposure and increased alcohol consumption.",62
https://openalex.org/W4307385456,10.1093/eurpub/ckac129.607,Resilience in Syrian refugee youth,"Abstract Background The importance of resilience factors in the positive adaptation of refugee youth is widely recognised. However, their actual mechanism of impact remains under-researched. The aim of this study was therefore to explore protective and promotive resilience mechanisms on both negative and positive mental health outcomes. Promotive resilience is seen as a direct main effect and protective resilience as a moderating effect. Methods Cross-sectional study with 160 Syrian youth aged 13-24 years, who recently resettled in Norway. A multi-dimensional measure for resilience was used to explore the potential impact of resilience factors on pathways between potentially traumatic events from war and flight (PTE), post-migration stress, mental distress and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Analyses included regression, moderation and moderated mediation using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Results A direct main effect of resilience factors (promotive resilience mechanism) was found for HRQoL and general mental distress, but not for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). No moderating effects of resilience factors (protective resilience mechanism) were found. Post-migration stressors mediated the effects of PTE, and this indirect effect was present at all levels of resilience. Relational and environmental level resilience factors and combined amounts had more impact than individual level factors. Conclusions Despite high risk exposure and mental distress, resilience was also high. The direct main effect of resilience factors and less impact on PTSD, suggests universal resilience building interventions may be beneficial, compared to exclusively targeting groups with high symptom levels. These interventions should target relational and environmental resilience factors as well as individual coping techniques. Additionally, reducing current stress and symptoms could increase the efficacy of resilience factors already present. Key messages • Refugee youth may have both high levels of risk and high resilience. • Universal resilience interventions should focus on relational and environmental support, as well as individual resilience.",62

Occupational stress is broken into two types: operational stress, related to the content of field duties (e.g., physical demands); and organizational stress, related to cultural and structural contexts (e.g., interpersonal relationships). Applied police research focuses on physiological activation in operational tasks as a mechanism explaining health risk and non-optimal performance outcomes. However, recent survey-based studies indicate numerous organizational stressors associated with self-reported mental health symptoms. The question of whether organizational stressors elicit significant physiological activity remains unknown. The current proof-of-concept field study tests the hypothesis that police managers will display significant physiological reactivity before, during, and after engaging in reality-based scenarios representative of stressful police management tasks developed from evidence-based pedagogical approaches. A sample of 25 training police managers (7 female, M = 16 +/- 5.3 years of experience) completed 5 reality-based scenarios, including resolving a heated conflict between colleagues, delivering negative feedback to a subordinate, and critical incident command. Significant increases in heart rate relative to rest were observed during all tasks, and in anticipation of several tasks. Greater increases in reactive heart rate were associated with longer recovery times. Sex differences and relationships between objective biological and subjective psychological measures of stress are discussed. The current findings demonstrate significant physiological responses to organizational stressors similar to levels observed during operational tasks, despite the absence of physical or aerobic exertion. Implications for police health and training are discussed.",62

A 20-Year Follow-Up Study,"Purpose: We examined the differences in physical health outcomes over a 20-year period between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults and heterosexual adults. We also examined whether the associations were moderated by social support and affect. Methods: The analytical sample included 168 LGB adults and 336 1:2 propensity-matched heterosexual adults from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. Using negative binomial generalized estimating equations and mixed effect analyses, data from three waves of MIDUS, spanning from 1995 to 2014, were used to examine the associations between sexual orientation and the health outcomes (number of chronic conditions and functional limitations). Social support and affect were added to the models to test for moderation. Results: LGB participants reported almost one more chronic condition at baseline and scored significantly higher for functional limitations. However, the number of chronic conditions for LGB participants increased less over time than compared to heterosexual participants, and there were no significant differences in terms of changes in functional limitation over time. Positive affect reduced the strength of the relationship between sexual orientation and functional limitations for LGB participants. No other moderating effects were significant. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that LGB individuals may become resilient to the negative health effects of minority stressors over time. Interventions should focus on improving the health of LGB individuals when they are younger and more at risk of negative health outcomes.",62

Here, we aimed to identify trajectory-based biomarkers using blood transcriptomes collected in the immediate aftermath of trauma exposure. Participants were recruited from an Emergency Department in the immediate aftermath of trauma exposure and assessed for PTSD symptoms at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Three empirical symptom trajectories (chronic-PTSD, remitting, and resilient) were identified in 377 individuals based on longitudinal symptoms across four data points (1, 3, 6, and 12 months), using latent growth mixture modeling. Blood transcriptomes were examined for association with longitudinal symptom trajectories, followed by expression quantitative trait locus analysis. GRIN3B and AMOTL1 blood mRNA levels were associated with chronic vs. resilient post-trauma symptom trajectories at a transcriptome-wide significant level (N = 153, FDR-corrected p value = 0.0063 and 0.0253, respectively). We identified four genetic variants that regulate mRNA blood expression levels of GRIN3B. Among these, GRIN3B rs10401454 was associated with PTSD in an independent dataset (N = 3521, p = 0.04). Examination of the BrainCloud and GTEx databases revealed that rs10401454 was associated with brain mRNA expression levels of GRIN3B. While further replication and validation studies are needed, our data suggest that GRIN3B, a glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit-3B, may be involved in the manifestation of PTSD. In addition, the blood mRNA level of GRIN3B may be a promising early biomarker for the PTSD manifestation and development.",62

We used data from the US Reserve and National Guard Study (n = 2003) to annually investigate incident and recurrent PTSD and depression symptoms from 2010 to 2013. We estimated the IR and recurrence rate over 4 years and according to several sociodemographic and military characteristics. From 2010 to 2013, IRs were 4.7 per 100 person-years for both PTSD and depression symptoms using the sensitive criteria, 2.9 per 100 person-years using the more specific criteria, recurrence rates for both PTSD and depression were more than 4 times as high as IRs, and IRs were higher among those with past-year civilian trauma, but not past-year deployment. The finding that civilian trauma, but not past-year military deployment, is associated with an increased risk of PTSD and depression incidence suggest that Reserve National Guard psychopathology could be driven by other, nonmilitary, traumatic experiences.",62

The contributions of event intentionality, frequency of the adversity types, age at serious event, spirituality/religiousness, active coping, PTSD symptoms and social support were explored as predictors of PTG across three samples of university students (N = 101; Study 1), survivors of violent crime recruited from support services (N = 71; Study 2) and those working with survivors of adversity (N = 96; Study 3). The results of Study 1 revealed that age at serious event, active coping, PTSD symptoms and social support positively predicted PTG. Within Study 2, spirituality/religiousness, active coping and social support were the significant positive predictors of PTG. Finally in Study 3, spirituality/religiousness, active coping and social support were the significant positive predictors of PTG. Across all studies, event intentionality and frequency of adversity types did not determine PTG. These results indicate that while participants within each of the populations have the ability to experience PTG, different factors predicted whether PTG was observed. The findings offer greater insight into the multifarious nature of adjustment following adversity.",62

However, there are limited data examining factors that influence this relationship. The purpose of this study was to extend the current literature by characterizing the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and sleep disturbance in a sample of trauma-exposed youth and to identify factors that may influence this relationship.Data were collected from 56 mental health centers across the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. For the current study, secondary data analysis was conducted using de-identified data from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network Core Data Set. The present study included 4043 children and adolescents who met eligibility criteria.Sixteen percent of the sample (n=634) met criteria for a sleep disturbance as determined through clinician assessment and collateral report. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity influenced the risk of disturbed sleep (ages 7-12: t=-4.33, ages 13-18: t=-7.12, P≤.001 for both analyses), with those meeting full criteria for PTSD at greatest risk (age 7-12: odds ratio [OR]=1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-3.24; age 13-18: OR=3.18; 95% CI, 1.87-5.43). Exposure to sexual assault and community violence also contributed independently to the risk of disturbed sleep (age 7-12, sexual assault: OR=1.76; 95% CI, 1.21-2.57; age 13-18, community violence: OR=1.61; 95% CI, 1.19-2.18).Comprehensive treatment strategies should include assessment of disturbed sleep in youth exposed to trauma, particularly those with elevated PTSD symptoms and exposure to sexual trauma or community violence.",62

Previous research suggests considerable heterogeneity in responses to trauma and loss with varying symptom representations. The purpose of the current study was to (1) identify classes of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom profiles among individuals who were exposed to both trauma and loss due to the Colombian armed conflict and (2) to examine whether sociodemographic, loss and trauma-related characteristics could predict class membership. Three hundred eight victims of internal displacement who had experienced trauma and loss were assessed through measures of PGD (PG-13), PTSD (PCL-C), and social support (DUKE-UNC). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to analyze differential profiles by symptoms of PGD and PTSD and multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze predictors of class membership. LCA revealed a four-class solution: a resilient class (23.6%), a PTSD-class (23.3%), a predominately PGD class (25.3%) and a high distress-class with overall high values of PGD and PTSD (27.8%). Relative to the resilient class, membership to the PGD class was predicted by the loss of a close family member and the exposure to a higher number of assaultive traumatic events, whereas membership to the PTSD class was predicted by the perception of less social support. Compared to the resilient class, participants in the high distress-class were more likely to be female, to have lost a close relative, experienced more accidental and assaultive traumatic events, and perceived less social support. Specific symptom profiles emerged following exposure to trauma and loss within the context of the Colombian armed conflict. Profiles were associated with distinct types of traumatic experiences, the degree of closeness to the person lost, the amount of social support perceived, and gender. The results have implications for identifying distressed subgroups and informing interventions in accordance with the patient’s symptom profile.",62

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is an effective treatment for PTSD. However, no previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been published on treating PTSD symptoms in a refugee camp population.ObjectiveExamining the effect of EMDR to reduce the PTSD and depression symptoms compared to a wait-list condition among Syrian refugees.MethodTwenty-nine adult participants with PTSD symptoms were randomly allocated to either EMDR sessions (n=15) or wait-list control (n=14). The main outcome measures were Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) at posttreatment and 4-week follow-up.ResultsAnalysis of covariance showed that the EMDR group had significantly lower trauma scores at posttreatment as compared with the wait-list group (d=1.78, 95% CI: 0.92–2.64). The EMDR group also had a lower depression score after treatment as compared with the wait-list group (d=1.14, 95% CI: 0.35–1.92).ConclusionThe pilot RCT indicated that EMDR may be effective in reducing PTSD and depression symptoms among Syrian refugees located in a camp. Larger RCTs to verify the (cost-) effectiveness of EMDR in similar populations are needed.",62

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 217 paramedics working in the Saudi Red Crescent Authority from September to December 2019. Participants completed questionnaires measuring PTSD symptoms (the Screen of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; SPTSD), passive and active coping strategies (Brief COPE Scale; BC), and three forms of social support: support from friends, family and organizational support. Associations between coping strategies, social support and PTSD symptoms were investigated using correlational analyses, hierarchical linear regression and binary logistic regression. Findings 46% of participants experienced one or more PTSD symptom, 28.6% scored above the cut-off for partial PTSD and 17.5% scored above the cut-off for full PTSD. PTSD symptoms were significantly positively correlated with passive coping and negatively associated with both family and friends support. Passive coping was positively associated with a greater risk of meeting criteria for PTSD. Originality/value The current findings suggest that interventions to help reduce PTSD in Saudi paramedics should include strategies to reduce passive coping. Future research is urgently required to help understand the psychological, social and work-related factors that contribute to these high levels of PTSD.",63

A representative cohort of U.S. Reserve and National Guard personnel ( N = 1,293) were interviewed to assess self-reported problems controlling violent behavior, deployment traumas, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol abuse, and social support. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the associations of violent behavior with risk and protective factors. Problems controlling violent behavior were uncommon among male (3.3%) and female (1.7%) service members. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) showed associations between violent behavior and deployment traumas (aPR = 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.34, 2.08]), PTSD (aPR = 9.95, 95% CI = [5.09, 19.48]), and PTSD symptom severity (aPR for each additional PTSD symptom = 1.07, 95% CI = [1.06, 1.09]). Social support was associated with lower prevalence of violent behavior (aPR = 0.62, 95% CI = [0.52, 0.76]). The association between violent behavior and alcohol abuse was not statistically significant (aPR = 1.94, 95% CI = [0.92, 4.09]). Results were consistent when the population was restricted to personnel who had deployed to a war zone. Problems controlling violent behavior were less common in this cohort than has been documented in other studies.

Design/methodology/approach A longitudinal survey administered to Christchurch workers with referents from the city of Hamilton at 6, 12 and 18 months after the 2011 earthquake. Potential risk and protective determinants were assessed by questionnaire items at baseline and over time, the outcome being PTSD as assessed by the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version. A longitudinal latent class analysis identified groups with similar trajectories of PTSD. Findings A total of 226 individuals, 140 (26 per cent) from Christchurch and 86 (16 per cent) from Hamilton, participated at baseline, 180 at 12 and 123 at 18 months, non-traditional responders forming the largest single group. Two latent classes emerged, with PTSD (21 per cent) and without PTSD (79 per cent), with little change over the 18-month period. Class membership was predicted by high scores in the Social Support and Impact of Events scale items, Health-related Quality of Life scores being protective. PTSD scores indicative of distress were found in females, and predicted by burnout risk, behavioural disengagement and venting. Practical implications Non-traditional responders should be screened for PTSD. Social support should be considered with the promotion of adaptive coping mechanisms. Originality/value The strength was longitudinal follow-up over an 18-month period, with demonstration of how the potential determinants influenced the course of PTSD over time.",63

Methods Data were collected using a cross‐sectional survey design. Participants were recruited from public housing developments in a city in the eastern United States. Participants completed a survey that included questions related to community violence, PTS symptoms, and optimism. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results We found a relationship between a generalized PTS response and each of the PTS symptom categories. Experiencing community violence was significantly related to generalized PTS response over and above other traumatic events. Conclusion Young adults who experience community violence have a general distress response to those experiences, and yet, beyond that general response, there are ways in which each symptom is distinct from a generalized distress reaction.",63

One such anomaly may well be the presence of a large cavum septum pellucidum (CSP), which has been loosely associated with PTSD. We performed a longitudinal prospective study of recent trauma survivors. We hypothesized that at 1 month after trauma exposure the relation between hippocampal volume and PTSD symptom severity will be moderated by CSP volume, and that this early interaction will account for persistent PTSD symptoms at subsequent time points. One hundred seventy-one adults (87 women, average age 34.22 years [range, 18–65 years of age]) who were admitted to a general hospital’s emergency department after a traumatic event underwent clinical assessment and structural magnetic resonance imaging within 1 month after trauma. Follow-up clinical evaluations were conducted at 6 (n = 97) and 14 (n = 78) months after trauma. Hippocampal and CSP volumes were measured automatically by FreeSurfer software and verified manually by a neuroradiologist (D.N.). At 1 month after trauma, CSP volume significantly moderated the relation between hippocampal volume and PTSD severity (p = .026), and this interaction further predicted symptom severity at 14 months posttrauma (p = .018). Specifically, individuals with a smaller hippocampus and larger CSP at 1 month posttrauma showed more severe symptoms at 1 and 14 months after trauma exposure. Our study provides evidence for an early neuroanatomical risk factors for PTSD, which could also predict the progression of the disorder in the year after trauma exposure. Such a simple-to-acquire neuroanatomical signature for PTSD could guide early management as well as long-term monitoring.",63

We, however, found no studies utilizing the CIHQ to examine posttraumatic growth (PTG) as measured by the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. The purpose of this brief report was to assess the strength and direction of the relationships between PTG with trauma frequency, trauma severity, and health variables, including subjective traumatic stress, relationship stress, nontraumatic work stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, and alcohol use among law enforcement officers ( N = 193) from small and midsize agencies. In addition, we sought to explore differences between cognitive and behavioral PTG. Based on results from bivariate and multivariate analyses, we found that an idiosyncratic view of trauma severity shaped by personal experience demonstrated the strongest relationship with PTG among the frequency and severity variables and that increased PTG was not associated with reduced psychological distress. Alcohol use, a variable that is assessed primarily through behaviors compared with cognitions, was not significantly associated with PTG. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate the importance for future research to consider both the frequency and severity of trauma exposure in the development of PTG and its impact on health outcomes.",63

Network analysis provides the opportunity to identify ""central"" symptoms that might hold an outsized influence over others and are important targets for research and treatment. The authors hypothesized that particular symptoms would exhibit greater influence over others. They further hypothesized marked differences in symptom networks across children and adolescents.Participants were 786 youth 8 to 13 years old (children) and 14 to 18 years old (adolescents) exposed to Hurricanes Katrina and Gustav who were assessed for PTSD symptoms using the University of California-Los Angeles PTSD Reaction Index for Children. Network models were computed and constructed using the R-package qgraph, which estimates associations between symptoms and forms graphic network models.Consistent with the hypotheses, the symptom network demonstrated meaningful variability across age, particularly in the strength of associations, and the relative importance of individual symptoms to the network as a whole. Results further demonstrated that symptoms cluster together in a manner that adds a unique perspective to current model conceptualizations.Network analysis is a potentially important additional conceptualization of psychopathology with related data analytic techniques. Results suggest that PTSD can be characterized as a web of interactions between symptoms. This work illuminates differences in the PTSD symptom network across development, such as the link between numbness of negative affect and amnesia in children, but not in teens, and how the critical symptoms within that network differ across childhood and adolescence. Network analysis could allow the re-envisioning of the nature of this complex disorder with new avenues for research and clinical practice.",63

The aim of this study was to examine the mental health effects of the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull volcanic eruption in Iceland on nearby residents, by exposure level and experience. Methods: This population-based study included 1615 residents living in an area close to the Eyjafjallajökull volcano at the time of the eruption and a sample of 697 residents from a non-exposed area. All participants received a questionnaire 6–9 months after the eruption assessing mental health (GHQ-12, PSS-4 and PC-PTSD). The exposed group also received questions related to the experience of the eruption. Results: Replies were received from 1146 participants in the exposed group (71%) and 510 participants in the non-exposed group (73%). Compared to the non-exposed group, participants living in the high-exposed area were at increased risk of experiencing mental distress (GHQ) 6–9 months following the eruption (odds ratio (OR) 1.45%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11–1.90). High-exposed participants were furthermore at increased risk of experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to those living in the low-exposed area (OR 3.71; 95% CI 1.34–15.41). We further found that those who had direct experience of the eruption were more likely to suffer from symptoms of mental distress, PTSD symptoms and perceived stress, compared to those less exposed. Conclusions: The findings indicate that screening for these factors (e.g. experience of the event) could potentially aid in identifying those most vulnerable to developing psychological morbidity after this unique type of disaster.",63

Self-reported symptom severity of PTSD, depression and general psychopathology, along with measures of resilience (self-efficacy, quality of life and posttraumatic growth cognitions), were target outcomes. Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Brief Symptom Inventory, General Efficacy Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment and Meaning of War Scale (personal growth) were assessed pre-treatment, post-treatment and at four months follow-up. Because of variable inter-assessment intervals, a piecewise mixed effects growth model was used to investigate treatment effects.Neither post-treatment, nor at mean follow-up, between-group effects were found. At follow-up, significant medium to large within-group effect sizes were found in the NET-group for psychopathology (self-reported PTSD: Cohen's d = 0.54, p < .01; depression: Cohen's d = 0.51, p = .03; general psychopathology: Cohen's d = 0.74, p = .001), but not so in the PCT-group. Resilience (self-efficacy, quality of life and personal growth cognitions) did not significantly change in either group.In older adults with PTSD, the efficacy of NET extended beyond PTSD, reducing not only self-reported symptoms of PTSD but also comorbid depression and general psychopathology.Objetivo: Utilizando datos de un ensayo controlado aleatorizado sobre psicoterapia para pacientes con trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) en adultos mayores (> 55 años), este estudio tuvo como objetivo analizar la eficacia de dos intervenciones psicológicas respecto a síntomas autoinformados, psicopatología comorbida, y resultados de resiliencia.Método: Treinta y tres pacientes ambulatorios (de 55 a 81 años) con TEPT fueron asignados al azar a once sesiones de terapia de exposición narrativa (NET en sus siglas en ingles) o terapia centrada en el presente (TCP). Los resultados que se midieron fueron, el autoreporte de la gravedad de síntomas de estrés postraumático, depresión y psicopatología general, junto con medidas de resiliencia (autoeficacia, calidad de vida y cogniciones de crecimiento postraumático). Se evaluaron antes del tratamiento, después del tratamiento y a los cuatro meses de seguimiento con los siguientes cuestionarios: Cuestionario de trauma de Harvard, el Inventario de depresión de Beck, el Inventario breve de síntomas, la Escala de eficacia general, Evaluación de la Calidad de Vida y de Significado de la Guerra de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (crecimiento personal). Debido a los intervalos variables entre evaluaciones, se utilizó un modelo de crecimiento de efectos mixtos por partes para investigar los efectos del tratamiento.Resultados: No se encontraron diferencias entre los grupos ni posteriores al tratamiento ni durante el seguimiento medio. En el seguimiento, se encontraron tamaños de efecto significativos medianos a grandes dentro del grupo NET. para psicopatología (TEPT autoinformado: d de Cohen = 0.54, p < .01; depresión: d de Cohen = 0,51, p = 0,03; psicopatología general: d de Cohen = 0,74, p = 0,001), pero no así en el grupo TCP. La resiliencia (autoeficacia, calidad de vida y cogniciones de crecimiento personal) no tuvieron cambios significativos en ninguno de los grupos.Conclusiones: En adultos mayores con TEPT, la eficacia de la NET se extendió más allá del TEPT, reduciendo no sólo síntomas autoinformados de TEPT, sino también depresión comórbida y psicopatología general.目的:本研究使用一个来自老年人 (> 55 岁) 创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 心理治疗的随机对照试验数据, 旨在分析两种心理干预在自我报告症状, 共病精神病和心理韧性结果方面的疗效。方法:33 名患有 PTSD 的门诊患者 (55-81 岁) 被随机分配到 11 个疗程的叙事暴露疗法或关注当下疗法。自我报告的 PTSD 症状严重程度, 抑郁和一般精神病以及对心理韧性 (自我效能, 生活质量和创伤后成长认知) 的测量是目标结果。哈佛创伤问卷, 贝克抑郁量表, 简要症状量表, 一般疗效量表, 世界卫生组织生活质量评估和战争意义量表 (个人成长) 在治疗前, 治疗后和四个月的随访中进行评估。由于内部评估间隔可变, 因此使用分段混合效应增长模型来研究治疗效果。结果:在治疗后和平均随访时均未发现组间效应。在随访中, 在 NET 组中发现了显著的中等到较大的组内效应量 (自我报告的 PTSD:Cohen’s d= 0.54, p< .01; 抑郁:Cohen’s d= 0.51, p= .03; 一般精神病:Cohen’s d= 0.74, p= .001), 但在 PCT 组中并非如此。心理韧性 (自我效能, 生活质量和个人成长认知) 在两组中都没有显著变化。结论:在PTSD 老年患者中, NET 的疗效超出了 PTSD, 不仅减少了自我报告的 PTSD 症状, 还减少了共病抑郁和一般精神病。.",63

This study investigated longitudinal associations between symptoms of social withdrawal and anxiety/depression in PBTS, as well as medical, demographic, and personal characteristics that may also influence reports of social withdrawal and anxiety/depression.Method: About 91 PBTS (51% male, mean age 11.21 years, off-treatment) participated. At baseline and 8 months follow-up, primary caregivers of PBTS completed measures of social withdrawal, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Medical information (e.g. tumor type and location, cranial irradiation therapy) and child personal characteristics (e.g. child’s age and gender, executive function, social skills) were obtained at baseline.Results: Baseline reports of depression symptoms and social skills predicted social withdrawal 8 months later. Social withdrawal at baseline predicted greater combined anxiety and depression symptoms 8 months later. Depression alone predicted greater anxiety symptoms at follow-up. Anxiety symptoms and poor global executive functioning predicted greater depression symptoms at follow-up.Conclusions: The social adjustment and psychological distress of PBTSs are interrelated and can influence each other across time. These findings support the importance of multifaceted interventions targeting both psychological distress and social adjustment, in order to support the optimal psychosocial adjustment of PBTSs.",63

Objectives Our study aimed to examine the the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among healthcare professionals working in COVID departments, and assess their professional quality of life. Methods Our sample consisted of 23 healthcare professionals who are working in the COVID departments of the Hospitals of Sfax. We collected their sociodemographic data, their medical history and COVID-related details. Their mental health was assessed by the Impact of Event scale (IES-R) and the professional quality of life scale (ProQOL-5) Results The sex ratio in our study was 17:6, with a mean age of 31.79 years. They carried out 5.43 nightshifts per month, 57 hours of work per week including 27.38 hours of direct contact with COVID positive patients. A rate of 21.74% of the patients had a high IES-R score, indicating severe post traumatic stress symptoms. As for the subscales of the professional quality of life score, 21.73% of the participants had a low compassion satisfaction score, 65.21% of the participants had a moderate one and 13% had a high one. A rate of 91.3% of the participants had a moderate burnout score, the mean was 29.39. The secondary traumatization score was low in 26% of the cases, moderate in 60.86%, high in 13% and the mean was 27.91. Conclusions COVID healthcare professionals are at a relatively high risk of developing burnout and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Disclosure No significant relationships.",63

However, research into these outcomes disproportionately focuses on cross-sectional data in high-income countries. We aimed to (1) investigate change in resilience across two timepoints in a highly vulnerable sample of Syrian refugee children in Lebanon, and (2) explore predictors of their mental health problems across time.In total, 982 Syrian child-caregiver dyads living in refugee settlements in Lebanon completed questionnaires via interview at baseline and follow-up one year later. We categorised children into groups based on their risk for mental health problems across both timepoints (stable high risk/SHR, deteriorating, improving, stable low risk) according to locally validated cut-offs on measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and behavioural problems. Analyses of covariance identified how the groups differed on a range of individual and socio-environmental predictors, followed up by cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) to investigate the directionality of the relationships between significantly related predictors and symptoms.The sample showed a meaningful amount of change in mental health symptoms from baseline to follow-up. Over half (56.3%) of children met SHR criteria and 10.3% deteriorated over time, but almost one-quarter (24.2%) showed meaningful improvement, and 9.2% were consistently at low risk for mental health problems at both timepoints. Several predictors differentiated the groups, particularly social measures. According to CLPMs, maternal acceptance (β = -0.07) predicted child mental health symptoms over time. Self-esteem (β = -0.08), maternal psychological control (β = 0.10), child maltreatment (β = 0.09) and caregiver depression (β = 0.08) predicted child symptoms and vice versa (βse = -0.11, βb = 0.07, βmpc = 0.08, βcm = 0.1, βcd = 0.11). Finally, child symptoms predicted loneliness (β = 0.12), bullying (β = 0.07), perceived social support (β = -0.12), parent-child conflict (β = 0.13), caregiver PTSD (β = 0.07), caregiver anxiety (β = 0.08) and the perceived refugee environment (β = -0.09).Our results show risk and resilience are dynamic, and the family environment plays a key role in children's response to war and displacement. Conversely, children also have a significant impact on the family environment and caregiver's own mental health. Interventions to promote resilience in refugee children should therefore consider family-wide mechanisms.",64

More common trajectories of adaptation include resilience, and posttraumatic growth (PTG). The objectives of the current study were to: (1) describe posttrauma adaptation profiles in a sample of Israeli male military veterans (N = 448); and (2) to explore the protective factors that promote constructive PTG within two profiles of posttrauma adaptation.The study used secondary data to estimate latent profile mixture models and a series of logistic regression analyses.Demographic controls, combat related variables, endorsement of coping strategies, and reports of improvement in social support were not significant predictors of constructive growth in the resilient class. However, those in the struggling growth subset of the sample who reported improvement in perceived social support increased the odds of reaching constructive growth.These findings highlight the importance of tailored clinical interventions that account for more complex profiles of posttrauma adaptation; and further, provide evidence that adaptation takes place over time. Finally, these findings call for future research to continue to explore the quality of PTG and the contexts in which protective factors promote positive adaptation.",64

The present study evaluates parent adjustment processes through the lens of the transactional stress and coping model by assessing a specific cognitive process (i.e., illness uncertainty) and coping methods (i.e., self-care), which may influence parent adjustment during the inpatient rehabilitation.Forty-two parents (47.6% White, 86% female) of children newly admitted to a pediatric inpatient rehabilitation hospital were recruited. Parents completed self-report measures of demographics, illness uncertainty, self-care, and depressive, anxious, and posttraumatic stress symptoms.Sixty-six percent of parents reported clinically significant symptoms in at least one domain of distress. Illness uncertainty accounted for 22.2%-42.4% of the variance in parent distress symptoms, after controlling for parent and child age, parent trauma history, and income. Self-care accounted for 35.1%-51.9% of the variance in parent distress symptoms, when accounting for parent and child age, parent trauma history, and income.More than half of parents endorsed clinical elevations in anxiety, depression, and/or posttraumatic stress. Illness uncertainty and self-care are likely very important clinical topics to discuss with parents. Future research should seek to not only assess how parent distress changes across time, but also how other cognitive processes, as well as environmental and family factors influence the parent adjustment process.

Comorbidity of PTSD, depression, and/or anxiety is examined. Method Police enrollees (N = 1,884) from the WTC Health Registry were categorized into four groups based on comorbidity of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. DSM‐IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD were used. Depression (PHQ‐8) and anxiety (GAD‐7) were assessed with standardized psychometric inventories. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify putative risk factors associated with comorbidity of PTSD. Results Of 243 (12.9% of total) police with probable PTSD, 21.8% had probable PTSD without comorbidity, 24.7% had depression, 5.8% had anxiety, and 47.7% had comorbid depression and anxiety. Risk factors for comorbid PTSD, depression, and anxiety include being Hispanic, decrease in income, experiencing physical injury on 9/11, experiencing stressful/traumatic events since 9/11, and being unemployed/retired.

Hospitalizations Among Persons Under 18 Years Of Age When Exposed To The September 11, 2001 World Trade Center Terrorist Attack","Much of the literature on hospitalizations post-September 11, 2001 (9/11) focuses on adults. These studies reported that 9/11-exposures and 9/11 post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were associated with increased risk of hospitalization for heart disease, asthma, and drug or alcohol abuse. Previous research among children exposed to 9/11 found that exposures such as being caught in the dust cloud, witnessing horrific events, or having PTSD were associated with asthma, behavior problems, school-functioning, and substance use. The objectives of this study were to describe the patterns of hospitalizations among enrollees in the World Trade Center Health Registry (WTCHR) who were under 18 years of age on 9/11 and to assess whether 9/11-related exposures or PTSD were associated with increased odds of hospitalization. Data for enrollees who were under 18 years of age on 9/11 in the WTCHR, a prospective cohort study, were linked to New York State administrative hospitalization data to identify hospitalizations from enrollment (2003-2004) to December 31, 2016. PTSD was defined as parent report of the child having at least six of eight 9/11-specific stress symptoms. Exposure to the dust cloud was defined has parent report of the child being caught in the dust and debris cloud resulting from collapsing buildings. Logistic regression, controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and sex, was used to analyze the associations between hospitalization, 9/11-related exposure, and PTSD. Cochran-Armitage Trend Test was used to examine trends between number of PTSD symptoms and hospitalization. Of 3,248 total enrollees under 18 years of age there were 457 enrollees with one or more hospitalizations (14.1%). There were 326 (71.3%) enrollees who had at more than 1 hospitalization. Among the 2,194 hospitalizations, 188 (8.6%) were for respiratory conditions, including asthma, sinusitis, and laryngitis, and 212 (9.7%) were for mental health or substance use conditions. Exposure to the dust cloud was associated with hospitalization for respiratory conditions (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0-2.2). PTSD was significantly associated with hospitalization for mental health or substance use conditions (AOR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1-7.1). There was a significant trend in the relationship between number of PTSD symptoms and respiratory conditions (p=0.0001) and mental health/substance use (p=0.0003) hospitalizations. Dust cloud exposure on 9/11 and PTSD are potentially associated with respiratory and mental health/substance use hospitalizations among those exposed to 9/11 as children. Continued monitoring of this population will be important to understanding the long-term effects of 9/11-exposure.",64
https://openalex.org/W2786722034,,WARNED : Risk factors for the development of PTSD,"This thesis has focused on results from a large prospective longitudinal cohort study in Dutch military personnel (PRISMO: Prospective Research in Stress-related Military Operations). In the current study, military personnel (N=1007) were assessed before and up to 5 years after a 4-month deployment to Afghanistan. The goal was to investigate psychological and biological aspects of stress-related (mental) health problems to be able to better predict who is at risk for the development of symptoms after deployment to a combat zone. The first aim was to gain more insight in the impact of deployment to a combat zone on the development of mental health problems, more specifically Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and character traits. It was shown that, despite the exposure to high intensity combat, a large percentage of Dutch military personnel does not develop mental health problems or show changes in character after deployment to Afghanistan. However, there is a group of individuals that reports significant difficulties with adaptation to life in the Netherlands. Compared to pre-deployment rates, the prevalence estimates of mental health problems (symptoms of fatigue, PTSD, hostility, depression, and anxiety) were found to increase after deployment. The course of this development appeared to be specific for various mental health problems. Moreover, whereas in some individuals, symptoms of PTSD emerged immediately and decreased after a year, in others these symptoms were only first reported as late as 5 years after deployment. In addition, whereas the level of the character trait cooperativeness was stable over time, self-directedness decreased over 5 years post-deployment. This decline in self-directedness was associated with the development of PTSD symptoms. Although many participants report exposure to combat-related stressors, only a subset develops mental health problems. Therefore, the second aim was to look if potential stress-related biological risk or protective factors (so called biomarkers) correlated to the development of symptoms of PTSD over time in military men. To do so, testosterone, neuropeptide-Y (NPY), oxytocin (OT), and arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels were measured in plasma before and at 1 and 6 months post-deployment. The findings demonstrated that whereas low plasma testosterone levels prior to deployment might represent a risk factor, the peripherally measured neuropeptides NPY, OT and AVP currently do not qualify as useful susceptibility biomarkers for the development of PTSD symptoms in military men after combat. The increase in symptoms even years after deployment underlines the importance of studying whether military personnel can be warned. Although many potentially interesting risk factors are identified, it is currently not possible to reliably predict an individuals’ risk of developing PTSD after exposure to a traumatic event. However, the use of complex and advanced statistical methods in large prospective longitudinal studies, such as PRISMO, to address the heterogeneity of PTSD and to identify multifactorial models are promising in the development of risk prediction tools and personalized preventive interventions.",64

We aimed to delineate anxiety trajectories over three time‐points in the first 6 months of the pandemic and identify baseline risk and resilience factors that predicted anxiety trajectories. Within weeks of the pandemic onset, we established a website ( covid19resilience.org ), and enrolled 1362 participants ( n = 1064 from US; n = 222 from Israel) who provided longitudinal data between April–September 2020. We used latent growth mixture modelling to identify anxiety trajectories and ran multivariate regression models to compare characteristics between trajectory classes. A four‐class model best fit the data, including a resilient trajectory (stable low anxiety) the most common ( n = 961, 75.08%), and chronic anxiety ( n = 149, 11.64%), recovery ( n = 96, 7.50%) and delayed anxiety ( n = 74, 5.78%) trajectories. Resilient participants were older, not living alone, with higher income, more education, and reported fewer COVID‐19 worries and better sleep quality. Higher resilience factors' scores, specifically greater emotion regulation and lower conflict relationships, also uniquely distinguished the resilient trajectory. Results are consistent with the pre‐pandemic resilience literature suggesting that most individuals show stable mental health in the face of stressful events. Findings can inform preventative interventions for improved mental health.",64

Empirical studies support the distinction between PTSD and CPTSD; however, less research has focused on non-western populations.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to investigate whether distinct PTSD and CPTSD symptom classes emerged and to identify potential risk factors and the severity of impairment associated with resultant classes.MethodsA latent class analysis (LCA) and related analyses were conducted on 314 young adults from Northern Uganda. Fifty-one percent were female and participants were aged between 18 and 25 years. Forty percent of the participants were former child soldiers (n=124) while the remaining participants were civilians (n=190).ResultsThe LCA revealed three classes: a CPTSD class (40.2%), a PTSD class (43.8%), and a low symptom class (16%). Child soldier status was a significant predictor of both CPTSD and PTSD classes (OR=5.96 and 2.82, respectively). Classes differed significantly on measures of anxiety/depression, conduct problems, somatic complaints, and war experiences.ConclusionsTo conclude, this study provides preliminary support for the proposed distinction between PTSD and CPTSD in a young adult sample from Northern Uganda. However, future studies are needed using larger samples to test alternative models before firm conclusions can be made.Highlights of the articleExamine the validity of CPTSD in a non-western sampleSeparate PTSD and CPTSD classes emergedFormer child soldiers were more strongly associated with the CPTSD classCPTSD class reported significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression, somatic complaints and conduct problems",64

Namely, we hypothesized that stress of COVID-19 will be positively associated with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and stress); well-being and resilience will be negatively associated with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and stress); and well-being and resilience will mediate the association between the stress of COVID-19 and mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and stress). Material and methods Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, the Resilience Scale for Adults, the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, and the COVID-19 Stress Scales were administered to 860 participants via online survey. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to address the study hypothesis. Results Participants recorded a mild level of stress of COVID-19 and high scores for resilience and well-being. A conceptual model depicting COVID‑19 stress as a predictor, mental distress as an outcome variable, and resilience and subjective well-being as mediators was confirmed. Conclusions Palestinians are exposed to mental distress in an environment characterized by ongoing stressors. Conversely, the capability of Palestinians to conserve good levels of well-being and resilience protects them from mental distress even in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. On the other hand, COVID-19 can be considered a new critical event demanding and diminishing the people’s resiliency recourses in Palestine. Implications for clinical practice and research are discussed.",64

In order to reliably assess the subtype, we developed the Dissociative Subtype of PTSD Scale (DSPS; Wolf et al., 2017), a 15-item index of dissociative features. Our initial investigation of the dichotomous DSPS lifetime items in a veteran epidemiological sample demonstrated its ability to identify the subtype, supported a three-factor measurement structure, distinguished the three subscales from the normal-range trait of absorption, and demonstrated the greater contribution of derealization and depersonalization symptoms relative to other dissociative symptomatology. In this study, we replicated and extended these findings by administering self-report and interview versions of the DSPS, and assessing personality and PTSD in a sample of 209 trauma-exposed veterans (83.73% male, 57.9% with probable current PTSD). Results replicated the three-factor structure using confirmatory factor analysis of current symptom severity interview items, and the identification of the dissociative subtype (via latent profile analysis). Associations with personality supported the discriminant validity of the DSPS and suggested the subtype was marked by tendencies towards odd and unusual cognitive experiences and low positive affect. Receiver operating characteristic curves identified diagnostic cut-points on the DSPS to inform subtype classification, which differed across the interview and self-report versions. Overall, the DSPS performed well in psychometric analyses, and results support the utility of the measure in identifying this important component of posttraumatic psychopathology.",64
https://openalex.org/W2797790783,10.1093/jbcr/iry006.191,269 Prevalence of Depressive Symptoms Over Time in Pediatric Burn Survivors,"Prior research shows that adult pediatric burn survivors have a higher incidence of mental health issues when compared to the general population. The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence of depressive symptoms over time in children being treated in outpatient burn clinics. The Multi-Center Benchmarking Study includes four burn centers that administered the Burn Outcomes Questionnaire (BOQ) to parents of children aged 5–18 to assess physical and psychosocial recovery from burn injuries. Children were eligible for the study if they were English or Spanish speaking, and had experienced a total body surface area (TBSA) burn ≥20% or a burn to a critical area (face, hands, feet, genitalia). Surveys were administered at the first return to the clinic after discharge from inpatient care (baseline), 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after discharge. This study focuses on the question, “This child feels depressed and talks about death” with possible answers: “None of the time”, “Some of the time”, “About half of the time”, “Most of the time”, and “All of the time”. Responses other than “None of the time” were considered a “positive” depressive or suicidal response. Surveys were collected from the parents of 836 total patients over the course of 7 time points. The rate of “positive” responses decreases over time among the full sample of cases at each time point as well as for subjects that had complete data at all 7 time points (Table 1). Around 50% of patients maintained a “positive” response from each successive time point. From baseline to 36 months, 45% of children had a “positive” response for at least one time point, while only 2% had a “positive” response at all time points. Over all 7 time points, the majority (72%) of children with a “positive” response were rated as being depressed “Some of the time” and only a small percentage (4%) of patients with a “positive” response were rated as being depressed “All of the time”. This study shows almost half of children recovering from burn injuries experience depressive symptoms at least once in the first 3 years of recovery. The prevalence of these symptoms is greatest at baseline and decreases until it tapers off around 12% at 2 to 3 years. Many children’s symptoms persist over successive time points, suggesting a lack of mental health evaluation. This study indicates a need to prioritize screening and treatment of mental health issues in children recovering from burn injuries, not only early in recovery, but 2 to 3 years post-injury.",64

Various mechanisms have been studied to explain the relationship between sexual trauma and PTSS. Other studies have looked at the impact of the victim-perpetrator relationship on the relationship between sexual trauma and PTSS with mixed results. Lacking from the literature is the possible mediating effect of peritraumatic schemas for the relationship between sexual trauma and PTSS. Additionally, the impact of the type of victim-perpetrator relationship may have on the development of peritraumatic schemas has also been unaddressed. This study seeks to close the gap in the literature by asking if peritraumatic schemas mediate the relationship between sexual trauma, specifically attempted and completed rape, and PTSS. The moderating role of the victim-perpetrator relationship on the association between sexual trauma and peritraumatic schemas was also examined. Using a college student sample that had endorsed experiencing at least one sexual trauma in their life, this study examined path analysis model explaining the mediating effects of peritraumatic schemas and the moderating effects of the victim-perpetrator relationship. Results indicated that peritraumatic schemas partially mediated the relationship between attempted rape and PTSS when controlling for completed rape. This effect was not found for the relationship between completed rape and PTSS when controlling for attempted rape. The interaction between attempted rape and the acquaintance perpetrator relationship was significant, indicating that peritraumatic schemas increased more severely for those that experienced attempted rape by an acquaintance. Recognizing that PTSS partially results from the peritraumatic schemas experienced, which are impacted by the victim-perpetrator relationship, helps increase understanding of the experience of attempted rape.",64

Cross-sectional. Six University of Texas Medical Branch family planning clinics located in Southeast Texas. A subgroup of 375 low-income women aged 18 to 31 years who experienced Hurricane Ike while participating in the Stress and Health Longitudinal Study (2006-2012). Risk profiles considering types and frequency of childhood abuse were identified in latent class analysis performed on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, which was measured upon entry to the study. Associations between abuse classes with a global indicator and 7 individual components of sleep quality measured after Hurricane Ike were estimated in adjusted logistic regression models. Prevalence of poor sleep quality in the month following Hurricane Ike was 39.7%. Of the 5 classes of childhood abuse identified, the most extreme abuse class—frequent combined emotional, physical, and sexual abuse—exhibited the strongest associations with poor sleep quality after the hurricane (odds ratio: 4.30; 95% confidence interval: 1.72-10.72). Occasional emotional abuse alone was also significantly associated with poor sleep quality after the hurricane (odds ratio: 2.70; 95% confidence interval: 1.48-4.91). Several profiles of childhood abuse were also significantly associated with 6 of the 7 component indicators of sleep quality, including sleep duration, disturbances, onset latency, subjective quality, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. Low-income women with histories of frequent childhood abuse, or emotional abuse specifically, have increased risk of poor sleep quality following exposure to a hurricane in adulthood.",64

However, few studies have examined these associations, the cumulative impacts of stressful events on mental health outcomes, and the role of social support. This study examined the prospective association between cumulative stressful events and mental health problems and the role of social support in young adults.Methods: 695 participants provided available data on earthquake exposure, childhood maltreatment, other negative life events, and social support at baseline. Depressive symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder were assessed at baseline and 10 years after the earthquake (T10y). A cumulative stressful events index was used to evaluate the levels of cumulative stressful events. Linear regressions were used to explore the predictive effects.Results: Of 695 participants, 41.3%, 28.5%, and 7.9% reported one, two, and three stressful events, respectively. The associations between cumulative stressful events and mental health problems at T10y presented a dose-response pattern: those who experienced three events had the highest risk of mental health problems, followed by those who experienced two events and those who reported one event. Additionally, higher social support partially reduced the negative impact of cumulative stressful events on mental health.Conclusions: Cumulative stressful events are associated with mental health problems 10 years later in young earthquake survivors. Social support could reduce the negative impact, but its protective role disappears when stressful events accumulate at the highest level. These findings highlight the importance of assessing the cumulative impacts of stressful events and social support available to young disaster survivors and intervening to prevent worse mental health outcomes.The associations between cumulative stressful events and mental health problems 10 years presented a dose–response pattern.Social support could buffer the negative impacts, but its protective role disappears when stressful events accumulate at the highest level.It is critical to assess the cumulative impacts of stressful events and social support available to young disaster survivors to prevent worse mental health consequences.",65

There is evidence that parents can play a critical role in how their children’s pain problems develop, are experienced, and are maintained, yet no study to date has quantitatively evaluated parental resilience. Participants were 135 parent–child dyads referred to a tertiary-level chronic pain program. Parents completed measures of post-traumatic growth (PTG), post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Youth (M age = 13.1) completed measures assessing pain intensity and interference. The most PTG was observed at moderate level of PTSS, suggesting that some stress was necessary to foster resilience. Parental PTG was positively associated with parental internalizing symptoms and child pain outcomes, and moderated the relationship between parental depressive symptoms and child pain intensity. Resilience and distress may co-exist in the parents of youth with chronic pain, with resilience acting as a potential buffer between parent distress and child pain.",65

ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes were used to identify ARHs (2003–2016) through linked administrative data. For the effect of 9/11-related exposures on ARH, Cox proportional-hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI); for time-varying PTSD, extended Cox proportional-hazards regression was used. Models were adjusted fora priori confounders and stratified by enrollee group (uniformed rescue and recovery worker (RRW), non-uniformed RRW, and community members). Person-time was calculated from baseline or 9/12/2001 to the earliest of ARH, withdrawal, death, or end of follow-up (12/31/2016). Across all 9/11-related exposures, community members and non-uniformed RRWs were at increased risk of ARHs; uniformed RRWs were not. In adjusted models, PTSD was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization across all groups [HR, (95 % CI): uniformed RRWs: 2.6, (1.9, 3.6); non-uniformed RRWs: 2.1, (1.7, 2.7); and community members: 2.6, (2.1, 3.2)]. Among certain enrollee groups, 9/11-related exposures are associated with an increased risk of ARH and that PTSD is strongly associated with ARHs among all enrollee groups.

To promote the mental health of college students with childhood adversities, it is imperative to investigate the development of CPTSD symptoms and the predictive factors.The study aimed to examine the latent trajectories of CPTSD symptoms among college students with childhood adversities and to identify the role of self-compassion in differentiating potential trajectories.A total of 294 college students with childhood adversities completed self-report questionnaires on demographic backgrounds, childhood adversities, CPTSD symptoms, and self-compassion three times with an interval of three months. Latent class growth analysis was used to determine the trajectories of CPTSD symptoms. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the association between self-compassion and trajectories subgroups while adjusting for demographic variables.Three heterogeneous groups of CPTSD symptoms among college students with childhood adversities were identified: the low-symptoms group (n = 123, 41.8 %), the moderate-symptoms group (n = 108, 36.7 %), and the high-risk group (n = 63, 21.4 %). Multinomial logistic regression showed that, after adjusting for demographic variables, students with higher levels of self-compassion were less likely to belong to the moderate-symptoms and high-risk group in comparison to the low-symptoms group.The results suggest the trajectories of CPTSD symptoms of college students with childhood adversities were heterogeneous. Self-compassion was a protective factor against the development of CPTSD symptoms. The present study provided insights into the mental health promotion for individuals with adversities.",65

The auditory disorder is the leading service-connected disability among veterans and is highly comorbidly diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The biopsychosocial model illustrates that chronic health conditions are exacerbated or maintained by psychiatric distress. Therefore, alleviation of such psychiatric distress can have beneficial impacts on health conditions, such as tinnitus. The aim of this study was to determine whether individuals with both disorders who receive evidence-based therapy for PTSD will experience decreases in both PTSD and tinnitus-related distress. Method: Veterans with comorbid bothersome tinnitus and PTSD received cognitive processing therapy and were assessed for PTSD, tinnitus-related distress, and depression at baseline and 1 month posttreatment follow-up. Results: At posttreatment follow-up, participants demonstrated significant decreases in PTSD symptoms compared to their baseline scores. Participants also demonstrated decreased tinnitus-related distress and depression, with high effect sizes. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated that clinical management addressing psychiatric distress, as associated with PTSD, may simultaneously provide benefit for patients with bothersome tinnitus. Although not statistically significant due to the small sample size, large effect sizes indicate that tinnitus-related distress decreased as a function of receiving evidence-based therapy for PTSD. Future clinical trials should increase sample sizes and compare effects to control conditions.",65

This study described the effects of 4 weeks of daily exposure to rocket attacks on children living on Israel's southern border. Participants enrolled in this study were 122 preschool children (50% boys) between the ages 3 and 6 years from 10 kindergartens. We assessed mothers' report of children's symptoms according to the DSM-IV and alternative criteria resembling the DSM-5 criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), general adaptation, traumatic exposure, and stressful life events 3 months after the war. The prevalence of PTSD was lower when the diagnosis was derived from the DSM-IV (4%) than from the DSM-5 criteria (14%). Mothers of children with 4 or more stressful life events reported more functional impairment in social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning compared to children with 0 or 1 stressful life event. Children with more severe exposure showed more severe symptoms and mothers had more concerns about the child's functioning (η(p)(2) = .09-.25). Stressful life events and exposure to traumatic experiences accounted for 32% of the variance in PTSD and 19% of the variance in the adaptation scale. Results were explored in terms of risk and resilience factors.",65

However, adaptation to spousal bereavement is a dynamic process. Thus, we examine the trajectories of the same participants longitudinally over two years. We identify the stability and change in profiles of adaptation to widowhood; probability of stability and change; factors that influence trajectories in profile membership.Methods Data stem from a longitudinal questionnaire study of 309 older widowed people. The questionnaire included five measures of well-being, serving as the dependent variables of this analysis, and measures of personal resources and contextual factors, including social support, marital happiness, psychological resilience, and demography. Data was analysed using latent transition analysis of the variables loneliness, hopelessness, depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, and subjective health.Results The analysis replicated the three Wave 1 profiles as the best theoretical fit: Vulnerables; Copers; and Resilients. Stability was most common, but some participants moved to more or less adaptive profiles, the former being more frequent. Younger age, longer time since widowhood, new life perspectives facilitated adaptation. Those transitioning to less adaptive profiles were more likely to be women and older.Discussion The path to adaptation was not linear. Many of the explanatory variables contributed both to positive and negative adaptation. These include previous caring experience, education, psychological resilience and personal strength. This suggests these explanatory variables do not act in isolation but are likely to interact with each other, and with other, yet not measured, factors.",65

However, few studies have investigated the association between maternal stress and anxiety symptoms over time and child development in preschool children. The aim of this study was to examine the association between trajectories of maternal stress and anxiety symptoms from mid-pregnancy to three years postpartum and child development at age three years.Data were analyzed from 1983 mother-child dyads who participated in the three year follow-up of the All Our Families (AOF) study. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify trajectories of women's stress and anxiety across from mid-pregnancy to three years postpartum. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between the stress and anxiety trajectories and child developmental delays while adjusting for the covariates.LCA identified three distinct trajectories of maternal stress and anxiety symptoms over time. Multivariate analysis showed mothers assigned to the high anxiety symptoms class had an increased risk (adjusted OR 2.80, 95% CI 2.80 (1.42 ─ 5.51), p = 0.003) of having a child with developmental delays at 3 years.The use of self-reported maternal mental health symptoms and no data on fathers' mental health are our study's limitations.The findings from a population-based Canadian sample provide empirical support for a relationship between maternal anxiety overtime and risk of child developmental delays. Identifying and supporting mothers experiencing high anxiety symptoms in the perinatal period may mitigate the risk of these delays in children.",65
https://openalex.org/W2762501142,,A Mixed Methods Approach to Exploring Social Support and Resilience in Coping with Stigma and Psychological Distress among HIV-Positive Adults,"Since its emergence in the U.S., HIV has been a stigmatized illness. People living with HIV (PLH) are a minority and prone to psychological distress and poor mental health outcomes due to HIV-related stigma. PLH who identify with another minority group in addition to being HIV-positive (e.g., gay, African-American) experience multiple forms of oppression or layered stigma. Affirmative social support and resilience are negatively associated with HIV-stigma and are important coping resources for PLH. We used an explanatory sequential mixed methods design study involving a quantitative survey phase and a qualitative interview phase. We explored whether social support and resilience (Positive Psychological Resources) mediate or moderate the relationship between HIV Stigma and Psychological Distress among HIV-positive adults using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling and multiple regressions. Via PLS, we found Positive Psychological Resources partially mediated the relationship between HIV Stigma and Psychological Distress: the path between HIV Stigma and Psychological distress reduced (from t = 5.49, p = .000 to t = 2.39, p = .000) but remained statistically significant. Similarly, via regression, the Sobel test was significant (Sobel = .26, SE = .07, z = 3.63, p = .000). However, moderation was not found (HIV Stigma x Positive Psychological Resources β = .05, t = .66, p = .508). Overall, our quantitative survey and qualitative interview data were consistent. We anticipate that our findings will inform strengths-based therapeutic interventions to mitigate stress and stigma among PLH.",65

The objective of this study was to assess the degree of depression, resilience and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in asylum-seeker war refugees, temporally stationed in Larisa, Central Greece, through self-administered questionnaire. Simple regression, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and one-way Anova was used. Methods A cross-sectional study carried out with asylum-seeker war refugees residing in Larisa at a number of apartments rented and ran by the UNHCR and the municipality of Larisa. For the data collection PHQ-9 questionnaire, CD-RISC questionnaire and Harvard Trauma questionnaire (HTQ) were used. Descriptive statistics were applied, as well as Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Results A total of 64 immigrants (40 males and 23 females, 1-mssing value) agreed to participate in the research. The mean age was 35.72 (SD 7.45), 35 respondents were classified as increased PTSD (scores &gt; 2.5). The results showed a physically and exhausted sample, with marginal mental strength (Mean = 59.38%), fluctuating between moderate (N% = 28.10%) and severe depression (N% = 28.10%). About one in two participants (N% = 54.70%) showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD, reporting traumatic experiences that mainly involved immediate events of violence, i.e. beating, while there were very few cases of sexual abuse or violence. A key factor in the formulation of PTSD, depression and Mental Stress Indicators was found to be age but limited to 43 years. Conclusion This study revealed that the refugees of the sample are tired, after being absent and idle for about 2 years from their homeland, in a marginal state of collapse. The most important event-hope that sustains its moderate resilience is the grant of asylum and the hope of arrival in the country of destination.",66

While evidence-based treatments for PTSD such as prolonged exposure therapy demonstrate effectiveness, residual symptoms and relapse remain problematic outcomes. Improvements in outcomes may be enhanced by modifying psychotherapy processes based upon recent neuroscientific findings. The present study explored incorporating memory reconsolidation principles into evidence-based exposure therapy for PTSD to create memory reconsolidation therapy (MRT). MRT incorporates memory recall followed by a wait period to make memories liable for modification. Using a case series design, three police officers diagnosed with PTSD participated in a maximum of twelve 90-min sessions of MRT and recorded weekly self-report measures of trauma symptoms and psychological distress. Results indicated participants experienced significantly reduced psychological distress with gains maintained over a 3-month follow-up. A significant reliable reduction in trauma symptoms by post-therapy was identified in two of the three cases with the third narrowly missing the clinically significant cut-off. These significant changes were maintained over the 3-month follow-up in one participant, while the maintenance of these improvements in trauma symptoms approached significance in the other two participants. These findings provide preliminary evidence to justify larger future studies to test the efficacy of MRT with police officers experiencing PTSD.",66

Two hundred and fifty Palestinian children, who had been recruited at primary schools in urban and rural areas, and refugee camps, completed the Multilevel Student's Life Satisfaction Scale, Children's Hope Scale (CHS), Children's Impact of Event Scale (CRIES) and Positive and Negative Affect Scales. We performed structural equation modelling to evaluate the effects of agency on negative emotions and trauma symptoms via life satisfaction. The participants appeared to play an agentic role in mobilizing their own life satisfaction, and the more satisfied they were with their lives, the less they suffered from trauma symptoms. In terms of clinical practice, we advocate more active and participatory approaches to fostering children's agency, a complex construct in need of further investigation via mixed-method quanti-qualitative and ethnographic studies.",66
https://openalex.org/W2810301838,10.1002/jts.22299,Treatment Outcomes for Military Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Response Trajectories by Symptom Cluster,"Abstract Although effective posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatments are available, outcomes for veterans with PTSD are relatively modest. Previous researchers have identified subgroups of veterans with different response trajectories but have not investigated whether PTSD symptom clusters (based on a four‐factor model) have different patterns of response to treatment. The importance of this lies in the potential to increase treatment focus on less responsive symptoms. We investigated treatment outcomes by symptom cluster for 2,685 Australian veterans with PTSD. We used Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist scores obtained at treatment intake, posttreatment, and 3‐ and 9‐month follow‐ups to define change across symptom clusters. Repeated measures effect sizes indicated that arousal and numbing symptoms exhibited the largest changes between intake and posttreatment, d RM = −0.61 and d RM = −0.52, respectively, whereas avoidance and intrusion symptoms showed more modest reductions, d RM = −0.36 and d RM = −0.30, respectively. However, unlike the other symptom clusters, the intrusions cluster continued to show significant changes between posttreatment and 3‐month follow‐up, d RM = −0.21. Intrusion and arousal symptoms also showed continued changes between 3‐ and 9‐month follow‐ups although these effects were very small, d RM = −0.09. Growth curve model analyses produced consistent findings and indicated modest initial changes in intrusion symptoms that continued posttreatment. These findings may reflect the longer time required for emotional processing, relative to behavioral changes in avoidance, numbing, and arousal, during the program; they also reinforce the importance of prioritizing individual trauma‐focused therapy directly targeting intrusions as the core component of programmatic treatment.",66

In an expanded secondary analysis of a previous study, we sought to examine the comparative effectiveness of PE and CPT delivered in the naturalistic setting of an intensive treatment format including maintenance of outcomes through a 6-month follow-up period.A sample of 296 veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) received either PE (n = 186) or CPT (n = 90), alongside other trauma-informed interventions, in a 2-week intensive clinical program. Treatment selection was determined collaboratively between patient and therapist. Our primary outcome was self-reported PTSD symptom severity (i.e., PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, PCL-5); secondarily, we examined self-reported depression (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire) symptom severity outcomes.A mixed-model regression controlling for age and gender revealed a significant effect of time from baseline to endpoint (p < .001), 3-month (p < .001), and 6-month follow-up (p < .001) on PCL-5 scores but no significant effect of treatment or effect of treatment by time interaction (all ps > .05; model: Wald's χ² = 232.38, p < .001). Results were similar for depression outcomes. Attrition at posttreatment was not significantly different between groups: 7.2% for CPT and 6.5% PE (z score = 0.22).Both PE and CPT are associated with comparable improvements when delivered as part of a 2-week intensive outpatient program.

Methods: The Fukushima Resilience Scale was developed based on data obtained from semi-structured interviews with seven people who had lived in the affected area of Fukushima Prefecture at the time of the disaster. The reliability and validity of the scale were then examined in cross-sectional studies conducted on 500 evacuees through an epidemiological mail survey. To examine the effects of the scale and disaster-related factors on the general mental health status of the respondents, a logistic regression analysis was performed using the six-item Kessler psychological distress scale. Results: The newly developed scale consisted of a four-factor structure: coping with stigma-related issues, sharing experiences of the disaster, action-oriented approach, and sense of support. Internal consistency coefficients ranged from 0.66 to 0.79. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the only significant association was between action-oriented approach (odds ratio = 1.26) and respondents with a K6 score <5 points. Conclusion: The reliability and concurrent validity of the new developed scale in residents of the evacuation area of Fukushima Prefecture were acceptable. A significant association was found between action-oriented approach and good mental health among the evacuees, which suggests that this may improve resilience among people affected by the Fukushima disaster.",66

Higher pain after a traumatic injury has been associated with higher PTSD symptoms and thus may be a risk factor. However, few studies have examined how pain during the period immediately after a trauma, referred to as the acute posttrauma period, relates later to PTSD outcomes. Methods A sample of ( n = 87) individuals who had experienced a traumatic injury assessed their pain through daily mobile assessments for the first month after injury. PTSD, depression, and functional impairment were assessed at the time of trauma and 1 and 3 months later. Results Using latent class growth analysis, three trajectories of pain were identified: low pain (41.3%), decreasing pain (43.7%), and high pain (14.9%). At baseline, the high-pain class reported higher levels of depression and functional impairment than did the low-pain group. From baseline to 3 months, the low-pain class experienced a reduction in PTSD, depression, and functional impairment, whereas the high-pain class experienced an increase in PTSD symptoms, persistent depression, and functional impairment. Conclusions These results demonstrate that there are distinct trajectories of pain after a traumatic injury. Persistent elevated pain is associated with more severe psychopathology in the period immediately after a traumatic injury.",66

Police mental health is a public health concern, but the mental health of civilian employees working in police organizations has been much less studied. The current study aims to compare the frequency of mental health conditions in both police officers and civilians. This was evaluated by measuring mean scores on several mental health screening tools including scales to determine symptom severity for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the PTSD Checklist - PCL-5, depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ), general anxiety with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), and alcohol use with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). The total potential population was 1,225 civilian employees and 3,714 police officers, of which 513 (10%) participated. Of these, 201 (16%) were civilians, and 312 (8%) were police officers (p<0.001). In the study population, 26% screened positive for any mental health disorder. Somewhat surprisingly, we found significantly more civilians (32.8%) than police officers (22.7%) met diagnostic criteria. We also found that civilian participants had higher mean scores in measures of PTSD, anxiety, and depression, although only for depression did this reach statistical significance. Civilians were 1.7 times more likely to screen positive for depression compared to police officers, a statistically significant difference. In contrast, police officers demonstrated statistically higher scores for alcohol use than civilians. One limitation of this study is that the data reflects responses from only a minority of the overall population and, therefore, may not accurately reflect the frequency of mental health issues in the total police organization including civilian employees. Nonetheless, the results strongly suggest that the mental health of all employees can be negatively impacted by working in a police environment, and this is important given the growing number of civilians employed within police organizations. These findings support initiatives aimed at destigmatizing mental health disorders, improving stress management, and increasing access to mental health care on an organization-wide basis, and not just limited to front-line police officers.",66

Follow-up at 3 and 12 months postinjury.SettingA level 1 trauma center and an emergency outpatient clinic.ParticipantsPatients with MTBI (n=358), trauma controls (n=75), and community controls (n=78).Main outcome measuresSymptoms were assessed with the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (BC-PSI). Participants were categorized as having moderate to severe PPCS (msPPCS) when reporting ≥3 moderate/severe symptoms or a BC-PSI total score of ≥13. BC-PSI total scores were compared between the groups and were further used to create cutoffs for reliable change by identifying uncommon and very uncommon change in symptoms in the community control group. Associations between symptom reporting and 25 injury-related and personal factors were examined.ResultsThe MTBI group had a similar prevalence of msPPCS at 3 and 12 months (21%) and reported more symptoms than the control groups. Analyses of individual trajectories, however, revealed considerable change in both msPPCS and BC-PSI total scores in the MTBI group, where both worsening and improvement was common. Intracranial lesions on computed tomography were associated with a greater likelihood of improving from 3 to 12 months. Those with msPPCS at both assessments were more likely to be women and to have these personal preinjury factors: reduced employment, pain, poor sleep, low resilience, high neuroticism and pessimism, and a psychiatric history.ConclusionsGroup analyses suggest a stable prevalence of msPPCS the first year postinjury. However, there was considerable intraindividual change. Several personal factors were associated with maintaining symptoms throughout the first year.",66

We examine the relationship between temperament traits in early childhood and subsequent trauma exposure and risk of PTSD. We used data on 2017 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Temperament was measured using the Carey Infant Temperament Scale (average score from ages 6 and 24 months). This provided data on 9 individuals traits, and Easy, Medium, and Difficult temperament clusters. Trauma exposure was measured from 0 to 17 years, and PTSD at age 23 years using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-V (PCL-5). Regression models were used to estimate associations between temperament and both trauma and PTSD, and to examine mediation (of temperament to PTSD pathway) and interaction (temperament X trauma on PTSD) effects. 1178 (58.4%) individuals were exposed to a trauma in childhood and 112 (5.5%) had PTSD. Higher levels of Intensity were associated with a small increase in trauma exposure (ORadjusted 1.23, 95% CI 1.12, 1.34; p < 0.001) and PTSD (ORadjusted 1.27, 95% CI 1.05, 1.54; p = 0.012). Higher levels of Activity, Adaptability, Mood and Threshold temperament traits were also associated with trauma exposure. Medium (ORadjusted 1.49, 95% CI 1.21, 1.84; p < 0.001) and Difficult (ORadjusted 1.47, 95% CI 1.18, 1.84; p = 0.001) temperament clusters were associated with increased trauma exposure compared to an Easy cluster, but were not associated with PTSD. The relationship between trait Intensity and adult PTSD was partially mediated by childhood/adolescent trauma (Indirect ORadjusted 1.08, 95% CI 1.01, 1.16, p = 0.024, proportion mediated 26.2%). There was some evidence that trait Intensity modified the relationship between trauma and PTSD (ORadjusted 1.66, 95% CI 1.07, 2.55, p = 0.023). PTSD in early adulthood is more common in those with intense stimuli responsiveness in childhood. Temperament traits might be useful predictors of trauma exposure and mental health outcomes and offer potential targets for supportive interventions.",67

Knowledge on protective versus risking processes is especially vital for tailoring effective help, and the present study proposes the maternal attachment style to play an important role in dangerous war conditions.ObjectiveThe study analyses, first, how various traumatic war events, such as losses, horrors and life-threat, are associated with maternal mental health and dyadic mother-infant interaction quality, indicated by maternal emotional availability (EA). Second, it tests a hypothesis that maternal insecure attachment risks and secure attachment protects good mental health and optimal EA from negative impacts of traumatic war events.MethodThe prospective three-wave study involved 502 Palestinian mothers, who were pregnant during the 2014 War on Gaza, and participated at delivery (T1), and when the infant was seven (T2; N = 392) and eighteen (T3; N = 386) months. Mothers reported about war events at T1 and T2 (death and losses, witnessing horrors and life-threat), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms at T2 and T3. Dyadic interaction quality was assessed by mother-perceived emotional availability (EA) scale at T2 and T3, and attachment styles by mothers’ self-reports at T3.ResultsDeath and losses, witnessing horrors, and life-threat were all associated with a high level of maternal PTSD, but only at T2, whereas death and losses were associated with her depressive symptoms both at T2 and T3. Witnessing horrors was associated with a low close and positive and a high distant and negative emotional availability at T2 and T3. As hypothesized, maternal avoidant attachment was associated with a low level of close and positive EA in general, and especially when the dyads were exposed to a high level of traumatic war events, thus indicating a risking function. Against the hypothesis, secure attachment did not show any protective function on emotional availability, while, unexpectedly, maternal preoccupied attachment was associated with close and positive emotional availability, when dyads were exposed to a high level of traumatic war events.ConclusionMothering in conditions of war and military violence is an overwhelmingly demanding task, and mother-infant dyads need legal, social, and psychological assistance. Knowledge and reflection of unique responses and meanings of different attachment styles would be fruitful in tailoring effective help.",67

A total of 71 083 respondents ages 18+ participated. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed exposure to traumatic events as well as 30-day, 12-month, and lifetime PTSD. Respondents were also assessed for treatment in the 12 months preceding the survey. Age of onset distributions were examined by country income level. Associations of PTSD were examined with country income, world region, and respondent demographics.The cross-national lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 3.9% in the total sample and 5.6% among the trauma exposed. Half of respondents with PTSD reported persistent symptoms. Treatment seeking in high-income countries (53.5%) was roughly double that in low-lower middle income (22.8%) and upper-middle income (28.7%) countries. Social disadvantage, including younger age, female sex, being unmarried, being less educated, having lower household income, and being unemployed, was associated with increased risk of lifetime PTSD among the trauma exposed.PTSD is prevalent cross-nationally, with half of all global cases being persistent. Only half of those with severe PTSD report receiving any treatment and only a minority receive specialty mental health care. Striking disparities in PTSD treatment exist by country income level. Increasing access to effective treatment, especially in low- and middle-income countries, remains critical for reducing the population burden of PTSD.",67

Burn survivors consider community reintegration one of the most important issues affecting their recovery. Integration, including social integration, has been studied in this population, but longitudinal analyses to examine factors associated with successful integration are lacking. The current study aims to assess variables associated with social integration during the first two years post-burn. Methods Adult (18+ years) burn survivors enrolled in the Burn Model System national longitudinal database responded to questionnaires at hospital discharge and 6-, 12-, and 24-months postburn. Social integration was assessed at all follow-up timepoints using the Community Integration Questionnaire Social Integration Component Scale, which has a possible range of scores from 0 (no community integration) to 12 (excellent community integration). To examine variables associated with social integration over time, linear mixed effect models utilizing generalized least squares with maximum likelihood and robust standard errors were used. Independent variables in the model included age, sex, % total body surface area (TBSA) burned, race/ethnicity, living status at time of injury, facial burn, history of psychiatric treatment preburn, employment at follow-up assessment, and SF-12 or VR-12 mental health component scores at the time of each follow-up assessment. Results Data from 1,848 adult burn survivors were included in the analyses. Average age of the survivors was 42.9 years, 74.0% were male, 77.7% were white, 47.0% were married or living common-law with a partner, and mean total body surface area burned was 18.2%. Factors associated with better social integration over time included younger age, female sex, lower TBSA (&amp;lt; 40%) burn size, white/non-Hispanic race, no preburn psychiatric treatment, postburn employment, and better mental health. Time was not a significant predictor, indicating that social integration scores remain relatively stable over the 24-month follow-up period. Conclusions We identified several factors that contribute to greater social integration including age, gender, burn size, race/ethnicity, employment, and mental health, with the association between age, gender, and employment status and community integration a novel finding in this population. Applicability of Research to Practice This study suggests that while most factors associated with social integration are not modifiable, interventions aimed at improving mental health and helping burn survivors return to work could also improve self-reported social integration.",67
https://openalex.org/W4386726180,10.1002/jts.22971,Differential impact of type of killing on posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in U.S. Army soldiers deployed to Afghanistan,"Abstract Over the past 20 years, U.S. military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have been marked by high rates of combat and wartime killings. Research on Vietnam‐era service members suggests that the type of killing (i.e., killing a combatant vs. noncombatant) is an important predictor of later mental health problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present study aimed to update these findings by exploring the impact of type of killing on PTSD symptoms using a sample of postdeployment active duty U.S. Army personnel ( N = 875). Using multiple regression analysis, we found that the act of killing a noncombatant was significantly associated with PTSD symptoms, B = 7.50, p &lt; .001, whereas killing a combatant was not, B = ‐0.85, p = .360. This remained significant after controlling for demographic variables, depressive symptoms, and general combat experiences. These findings support the need for thoughtful postdeployment screenings and targeted clinical interventions.",67

Although some literature has explored this heterogeneity, there are only a few studies identifying factors associated with it within the disaster literature.The current investigation identified latent classes of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and differences between these classes after exposure to Hurricane Ike.Adults living in Galveston and Chambers County, Texas, (n = 658) completed a battery of measures during an interview conducted two to five months after Hurricane Ike. Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify latent classes of PTSD symptoms. Additionally, gender, age, racial or ethnic minority status, depression severity, anxiety severity, quality of life, perceived need for services, and disaster exposure were examined to explore class differences.LCA supported a 3-class model with low (n = 407, 61.9%), moderate (n = 191, 29.0%), and high PTSD symptoms (n = 60, 9.1%). Women appeared most at-risk for a moderate-severity presentation as compared to a low-severity presentation. Further, racial or ethnic minority groups appeared most at-risk for a high-severity presentation as compared to a moderate-severity presentation. Overall, the high symptom class had the poorest well-being, the most perceived need for services, and the highest exposure to the disaster, followed by the moderate symptom class, and finally the low symptom class.PTSD symptom classes appeared to be differentiated primarily by overall severity as well as important psychological, contextual, and demographic dimensions.",67
https://openalex.org/W2793647339,10.1089/neu.2017.5379,Depression in the First Year after Traumatic Brain Injury,"The aims of this study were to document the frequency of major and minor depressive episodes in the first year after traumatic brain injury (TBI), taking into account TBI severity and pre-morbid history of major depression, and to describe trajectories of depressive episodes. Participants were 227 adults who were hospitalized post-TBI (76% male; mean age = 41 years; 50% mild, 33% moderate, and 17% severe TBI). Major and minor depressive episodes were assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview at three time points (4, 8, and 12 months after TBI). Overall, 29% of participants had a major depressive episode in at least one of the three assessments, with fairly stable rates across assessments. Participants with mild TBI were more likely than those with moderate/severe TBI to be diagnosed with major depression, as were individuals with a positive pre-morbid history of depression compared to those without such history. In addition, 13% of participants had a minor depressive episode in at least one of the three assessments. Rates of minor depression significantly decreased from 4 to 8–12 months post-injury. Results also revealed a wide variety of trajectories of depressive episodes across assessments. Of note, 52% of major depression cases still fulfilled diagnostic criteria 4 months later, whereas 38% of minor depression cases deteriorated to major depression at the following assessment. These findings suggest that depression is highly prevalent after TBI, and monitoring of patients with subthreshold depressive symptoms is warranted in order to prevent the development of full-blown major depressive episodes.",67

This study evaluates the associations of polygenic risk scores (PRS) with patterns of posttraumatic stress symptoms following combat deployment.US Army soldiers of European ancestry (n = 4900) provided genomic data and ratings of posttraumatic stress symptoms before and after deployment to Afghanistan in 2012. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to model posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories among participants who provided post-deployment data (n = 4353). Multinomial logistic regression models tested independent associations between trajectory membership and PRS for PTSD, major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia, neuroticism, alcohol use disorder, and suicide attempt, controlling for age, sex, ancestry, and exposure to potentially traumatic events, and weighted to account for uncertainty in trajectory classification and missing data.Participants were classified into low-severity (77.2%), increasing-severity (10.5%), decreasing-severity (8.0%), and high-severity (4.3%) posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories. Standardized PTSD-PRS and MDD-PRS were associated with greater odds of membership in the high-severity v. low-severity trajectory [adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, 1.23 (1.06-1.43) and 1.18 (1.02-1.37), respectively] and the increasing-severity v. low-severity trajectory [1.12 (1.01-1.25) and 1.16 (1.04-1.28), respectively]. Additionally, MDD-PRS was associated with greater odds of membership in the decreasing-severity v. low-severity trajectory [1.16 (1.03-1.31)]. No other associations were statistically significant.Higher polygenic risk for PTSD or MDD is associated with more severe posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories following combat deployment. PRS may help stratify at-risk individuals, enabling more precise targeting of treatment and prevention programs.",67
https://openalex.org/W2900352425,10.1037/tra0000413,Self-reported mindfulness and soldier health following a combat deployment.,"Combat exposure has been linked to health-related challenges associated with postcombat adjustment, including mental health symptoms, behavior-related problems, physical pain, and functional impairment. Mindfulness, or acceptance of the present moment without reactivity or judgment, may be associated with better mental health following a combat deployment. This study examined whether self-reported mindfulness predicted soldier health outcomes over the course of the postdeployment period.U.S. soldiers (n = 627) were surveyed 4 months after a deployment to Afghanistan (T1) and again 3 months later (T2). Mindfulness was assessed using the nonreactivity to inner experience subscale of the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. Hierarchical linear regressions examined how mindfulness (T1) moderated the impact of combat exposure (T1) on outcomes at T2.Controlling for rank, the interaction between combat exposure and mindfulness significantly predicted posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression symptoms, risk-taking behaviors, pain symptoms, and functional impairment. The interaction term explained 1% to 2% of the variance in these health outcomes. Simple slopes analyses revealed that combat exposure was associated with more PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, risk-taking behaviors, pain symptoms, and functional impairment when soldiers reported low levels of mindfulness. There was no effect for alcohol misuse, sleep difficulties, or aggressive behaviors.Nonreactivity to inner experience may mitigate the detrimental effects of high-levels of combat exposure on both mental and physical health outcomes. These findings indicate that mindfulness strategies such as nonreactivity may be particularly useful for employees facing potentially traumatic stressors in a high-risk occupational context.

A follow‐up analysis of a pilot randomised controlled trial for youth,"We conducted a follow-up analysis of a pilot randomised controlled trial to examine whether baseline depression and anxiety symptoms moderated the impact of a motivational enhancement therapy (MET) pretreatment to dialectical behaviour therapy skill training (DBT-ST) for EA experiencing emotion dysregulation.All participants completed a 12-week DBT-ST group intervention and participants in the MET/DBT-ST condition also completed a 4-week group MET pretreatment. Nineteen MET/DBT-ST participants and 26 DBT-ST only participants completed the treatment as per protocol.Baseline anxiety and depression symptoms moderated the impact of the MET pretreatment for participants' reductions in emotion dysregulation and psychological distress, respectively, at a 3-month follow-up: participants with more severe baseline symptoms benefited more from the pretreatment. However, baseline symptoms did not moderate the effect of MET immediately after treatment.These results identified for whom MET is most effective as a pretreatment for DBT-ST amongst a heterogenous sample of EA in a real-world setting.",67

We aimed to assess the trajectories of asthma symptom and their associations with several family environmental factors during the childhood period in Australia.Secondary analysis from a cross-sequential cohort study.Nationwide representative data from the 'Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC)'.Participants from the LSAC birth cohort.Asthma symptom trajectory groups.Asthma symptom presenting as wheezing, family environmental factors and sociodemographic data (2004-2018) were obtained from the LSAC. Group-based trajectory modelling was applied to identify asthma symptom trajectories and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between these and environmental factors.Of 5107 children in the LSAC cohort, 3846 were included in our final analysis. We identified three distinct asthma symptom trajectories from age 0/1 year to 14/15 years: 'low/no' (69%), 'transient high' (17%) and 'persistent high' (14%). Compared with the 'low/no' group, children exposed to 'moderate and declining' (relative risk ratio (RRR): 2.22, 95% CI 1.94 to 2.54; RRR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.46) and 'high and persistent' prevalence of maternal smoking (RRR: 1.41, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.60; RRR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.44) were at increased risk of being classified into the 'transient high' and 'persistent high' trajectories of asthma symptom. Persistently bad external dwelling conditions (RRR: 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.51) were associated with 'transient high' trajectory while 'moderate and increasing' conditions of cluttered homes (RRR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.56) were associated with 'persistent high' trajectory of asthma symptom. Exposure to tobacco smoke inside the house also increased the risk of being in the 'persistent high' trajectory group (RRR: 1.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.50).Poor home environment increased the risk of asthma symptom during childhood. Improving home environment and reducing exposure to tobacco smoke may facilitate a favourable asthma symptom trajectory during childhood.",67

A second aim was to compare psychological distress and self-rated health of exposed young adults with a matched population-based sample.Method: Young adults, who experienced the 2004 tsunami as children between 10 and 15 years of age, responded to a questionnaire eight years post disaster. The results were compared to a matched population sample.Results: The results showed that the likelihood for negative psychological outcomes was higher for those who had been exposed to several types of exposures during this natural disaster.Conclusions: The negative psychological impact on children and adolescents can still be present eight years post-disaster and seems to have association with the type of exposure; loss, physical presence and subjective experience. It is important for clinicians, who meet young adults seeking help, to be conscious about the impact as long as eight years post disaster and to be aware of possible clinical implications associated with severity of exposures.",67

To resolve discrepancies, we suggest that self-reports of post-traumatic growth should not be taken at face value as indicating actual growth as in some cases such reports may be indicative of an illusory self-protective mechanism. As such we hypothesised that reports of post-traumatic growth are associated with defense styles. We also tested whether the association between self-reports of post-traumatic growth and well-being would be moderated by defensive styles. In a sample of 153 college students who had experienced some degree of trauma it was found that self-reports of post-traumatic growth were associated with a neurotic and an immature defense style. The association between self-reports of post-traumatic growth and positive as well as negative affect was moderated significantly by a mature defense style, such that for those with high mature defenses, higher scores of self-reports of post-traumatic growth were associated with lower increases in positive, and higher increases in negative, affect. The results suggest that self-reports of post-traumatic growth may sometimes reflect defensive processes rather than actual change.",67

With the provision of multi-faceted support and the progress of the reconstruction, their mental health has appeared to show signs of recovery. However, there have been few studies investigating their recovery. To clarify the related factors associated with mental health recovery, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted. Subjects whose answers were associated with Resilience, Recovery, and Remitting patterns of mental health status were categorized in the Recovery group, while those associated with Delayed/Chronic dysfunction were placed in the Non-recovered group. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, disaster-related unemployment (odds ratio (OR): 0.80, 95% CI (confidence interval): 0.65–0.99) and economic hardship (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.65–0.98) were associated with the hindrance of recovery. In contrast, overall good health (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.20–1.80), regular physical activity (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.01–1.50), social interaction with friends (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.00–1.55), and established social roles (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.14–1.82) were associated with the promotion of recovery. In conclusion, our study showed a positive association between mental health recovery and a desirable lifestyle and social network, particularly with social roles.

The purpose of this research was threefold: (a) to identify whether college students’ very early reactions to an on-campus shooting were associated with well-known predictors of distress, (b) to examine whether grief and distress reactions were distinguishable in the early days following a shooting, and (c) to investigate whether a compassionate self-identity was uniquely associated with grief but not distress. Beginning just 3 days after an early morning shooting that killed one student and injured three others, university students ( N = 408) completed an online questionnaire. Grief, but not distress, was associated with a sense of solidarity with other students and a compassionate self-identity. General distress was associated with prior mental health difficulties and exposure to the shooting. Acute stress was positively associated with being female, having prior mental health difficulties, media exposure, perceived similarity to victims, less victim blame, social support, and social strain. Results suggest that grief reactions that arise in the early days following a collective loss may serve as important psychosocial resources in coping with interpersonal violence.",68

It is therefore pertinent to understand the needs of the youth and the factors that determine their well-being. This study explores the understanding and definition of well-being from the perspective of Palestinian youths, and their views of the factors that influence wellbeing.MethodsA qualitative investigation of twelve focus group discussions was carried out in 2017. The participants were Palestinian youths (aged 18–32 years) residing in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Participants were selected using snowball sampling, with the help of various community organisations, and youths' personal contacts. A total of 123 youths participated in the discussions, which were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Research team members coded the transcripts and then organized codes into key dimensions of life (ie, economic, political, social, and personal), and into themes within these dimensions. Ethics approval was obtained from Birzeit University. Informed verbal consent was obtained from all participants.FindingsThe participants defined wellbeing as having good health (both physical and psychological), being active, and having the energy, drive, and stamina to face challenges and to persevere. We organised the reported determinants of wellbeing into four key dimensions of life: political, economic, social, and personal. In general, the participants believed that they influenced wellbeing through their interactions with each other. The political dimension was reported to be an important determinant of wellbeing, and had a direct effect on other dimensions, particularly the economic dimension. Prolonged military occupation and blockade in the Gaza Strip, and related restrictions were perceived to have a negative impact on wellbeing, especially when they limited the youths' mobility and opportunities. The participants' discussions of the internal political situation highlighted the diminishing space for youth in the political and public spheres, as well as a lack of trust in Palestinian political institutions. Participants noted that corruption, cronyism and nepotism, autocracy, and ageism within these institutions further excluded and demoralised youth. The economic dimension included personal and household economic conditions, as well as broader economic conditions, both at the local and country level. The youths believed that adequate economic conditions at the household level are necessary but insufficient to ensure wellbeing, and that poor economic conditions at a broader level, especially unemployment, had negative effects on wellbeing. The social dimension includes both family-level factors and societal-level factors. Most youths considered their families to be a source of support with positive family relationships resulting in better wellbeing. However, experiences within the broader community were mixed, with youths consistently noting that they faced negativity and discouragement from others. The participants reported that personal characteristics moderated the effects of social, economic, and political conditions; personality traits such as determination and perseverance had the potential to help them to overcome negative influences.InterpretationThe findings from this study highlight the ways in which various dimensions of life interact to influence wellbeing from the perspective of Palestinian youths. The extremely challenging political and economic conditions, and the continued exclusion of youth from various aspects of life, as described by participants, hinder wellbeing and add to the discouragement of youth.FundingThe fieldwork for this study was funded by a grant from Oxfam Quebec.",68

The aim of this study was to identify heterogeneous trajectory subgroups for family conflict and somatic symptoms and their joint trajectories. A representative sample of 424 community participants completed surveys at baseline and 1-, 4-, and 10-year follow-ups. Family conflict and somatic symptoms were assessed at each wave. Covariates (age, gender, marital status, education, and medical conditions) were assessed at baseline. Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to identify heterogeneous trajectory subgroups for family conflict and somatic symptoms. A parallel process GMM was used to examine joint trajectory subgroup membership between family conflict and somatic symptoms. There were three trajectory subgroups for family conflict: stable low; worsening; and improving, and three somewhat similar trajectory subgroups for somatic symptoms: stable low; stable moderate; and improving. Family conflict and somatic symptom trajectory subgroup memberships were jointly associated. Individuals who had stable low family conflict were most likely to follow a stable low somatic symptom trajectory. Individuals who improved in family conflict were most likely to continue to have stable low somatic symptoms or improve in somatic symptoms. Moreover, individuals who had stable moderate somatic symptoms were most likely to show worsening family conflict. This study demonstrates heterogeneous family conflict and somatic symptom trajectories and indicates that these trajectories covary over time.",68

Integrating behavioral interventions that target symptoms of PTSD and comorbidities into the acute care setting can overcome common barriers to obtaining mental health care. This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of embedding elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in the delivery of routine postinjury care management. The investigation also explored the potential effectiveness of completion of CBT element homework that targeted PTSD symptom reduction. Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of data from a U.S. clinical trial of the effectiveness of a stepped collaborative care intervention versus usual care for injured inpatients. The investigation examined patients’ willingness at baseline (prerandomization) to engage in CBT and pre- and postrandomization mental health service utilization among 115 patients enrolled in the clinical trial. Among intervention patients (N=56), the investigation examined acceptability of the intervention and used multiple linear regression to examine the association between homework completion as reported by the care manager and six-month PTSD symptom reduction as assessed by the PTSD Checklist–Civilian DSM-IV Version. Results: Patients in the intervention condition reported obtaining significantly more psychotherapy or counseling than patients in the control group during the six-month follow-up, as well as a high degree of intervention acceptability. Completion of CBT element homework assignments was associated with improvement in PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Integrating behavioral interventions into routine acute care service delivery may improve the reach of evidence-based mental health care targeting PTSD.",68

Empirical evidence on the relationship between social support and post-disaster mental health provides support for a general beneficial effect of social support (main-effect model; Wheaton, 1985). From a theoretical perspective, a buffering effect of social support on the relationship between disaster-related stress and mental health also seems plausible (stress-buffering-model; ibid.). Previous studies however a) have paid less attention to the buffering effect of social support and b) they have mainly relied on interpersonal support (but not collective-level support such as community resilience) when investigating this issue. This work might has underestimated the effect of support on post-disaster mental health. Building on a sample of residents in Germany recently affected by flooding (N = 118), we show that community resilience to flooding (but not general interpersonal social support) buffered against the negative effects of flooding on post-disaster mental health. The results support the stress-buffering model and call for a more detailed look at the relationship between support/resilience and post-disaster adjustment, including collective-level variables.",68

Empirical evidence though is inconsistent. Some studies report associations between AB towards, threat and PTS; other studies report associations between AB away from threat and PTS; yet other studies fail to find any association. We propose that prospective-longitudinal study of AB as a dynamic process, expressed from moment to moment in time, may help to understand these mixed findings and the role of AB in PTS.We tested cross-sectional and prospective-longitudinal associations between AB and PTS among German soldiers from pre- to post-deployment in Afghanistan (n = 144). AB to threat and positive emotion stimuli (angry/happy faces) was measured using the dot-probe task. PTS was assessed by the PTSD Checklist. The number of traumatic experiences was assessed using CIDI-traumatic experience lists for military.We found that AB dynamics (i.e., towards, away, temporal variability) at pre- and post-deployment, with respect to angry and happy faces, predicted higher levels of PTS after deployment as a function of number of intermediate traumatic experiences. Traditional aggregated mean bias scores did not similarly prospectively predict PTS post deployment.Findings indicate that AB to emotionally arousing stimuli may play an important function in the development and maintenance of PTS. We argue that mixed and null findings appear to be due to failure to model the within-subject temporal variability in AB expression. Theoretical, empirical, and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",68

A logical explanation for the different mental health outcomes of individuals exposed to trauma would seem to be personality factors and thought control strategies. Trauma exposure is necessary but not sufficient for the development of PTSD. To this end, we assess the role of personality traits and coping styles in PTSD vulnerability among Israeli and Palestinian students amid conflict. We also determine whether gender and exposure level to trauma impact the likelihood of the onset of PTSD symptoms. Five questionnaires assess previous trauma, PTSD symptoms, demographics, personality factors and thought control strategies, which are analyzed using path analysis. Findings show that the importance of personality factors and thought control strategies in predicting vulnerability increases in the face of political violence: the higher stress, the more important the roles of personality and thought control strategies. Thought control strategies associated with introverted and less emotionally stable personality-types correlate positively with higher levels of PTSD symptoms and depression, particularly among Palestinians. By extension, because mental health is key to reducing violence in the region, PTSD reduction in conflict zones warrants rethinking.",68

Limited research has examined PTSD symptom clusters and their associations with functioning and distress among disaster recovery workers, a population at high risk for PTSD due to potential for repeated trauma. The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between overall PTSD severity, as well as PTSD symptom clusters, and social and occupational functioning and subjective distress in World Trade Center (WTC) disaster workers after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 (9/11). Disaster workers deployed to the site of the attacks completed assessments at three time points over approximately 5 years post‐9/11. Our sample consisted of participants who met criteria for PTSD or subthreshold PTSD at baseline ( n = 514), 1‐year ( n = 289), and 2‐year follow‐up ( n = 179). Adjusted linear regression indicated that Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)‐rated PTSD severity was positively associated with subjective distress, and deficits in social and occupational functioning, over time, CAPS Criterion F items; βs = .20 to .62, p s &lt; .001. The reexperiencing and avoidance/numbing symptom clusters were associated with increased subjective distress, the avoidance/numbing and hyperarousal clusters were associated with deficits in social functioning, and the reexperiencing and hyperarousal clusters were associated with worse occupational functioning. These associations were consistent across the study period. Findings point to the importance of targeting PTSD symptom clusters associated with specific areas of functional impairment, with the goal of improving global outcomes.",68

Methods: Structured interviews were conducted with a nationally representative sample of RC personnel (n = 2,003). We used weighted descriptive statistics to examine the prevalence of PTSD, depression, and binge drinking. Results: The prevalence of PTSD was 6.7%, depression was 6.8%, and binge drinking was 11.5%. The prevalence of having one or more mental health problems investigated in this study was 19.8%. The prevalence of binge drinking was higher for enlisted men (14.8%) than enlisted women (2.6%). Having one or more mental health problems was nearly twice as high for enlisted men (23.4%) vs. enlisted women (12.9%). For deployed personnel, the prevalence of PTSD or having one or more mental health problems was approximately twice that of never-deployed personnel. Conclusions: Prevalence of mental health problems can inform prevention and treatment for RC personnel. Further research is needed to identify risk factors for PTSD, depression, and binge drinking.

Logistic regression was used to analyze factors associated with hospitalization. Of the 3151 enrollees under age 18 on 9/11, 243 (7.7%) had at least one 9/11-related physical health hospitalization and 279 (8.9%) had at least one 9/11-related mental health hospitalization. Individuals of non-White race, those living in New York City Housing Authority housing, those exposed to the dust cloud on 9/11, and those with probable 9/11-related PTSD symptoms were more likely to be hospitalized for a 9/11-related physical health condition. Older age and having probable 9/11-related PTSD symptoms at baseline were associated with being hospitalized for a 9/11-related mental health condition. Dust cloud exposure on 9/11 and PTSD symptoms were associated with hospitalizations among those exposed to 9/11 as children.

Overall, burn survivors have a shorter life expectancy, as compared with national controls, but long-term mortality after self-inflicted burns is understudied. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate possible differences in long-term mortality among survivors after self-inflicted and accidental burns. All adult patients with burns admitted at the Linköping Burn Centre and discharged alive between 2000 and 2017 were included, and end of follow up was April 26, 2021. Those with unknown survival status at that time were excluded. A Cox proportional hazards regression model, adjusted for age and sex, was used to analyse long term mortality. Among the 930 patients included in this study, 37 had self-inflicted burns. Overall, median follow up period was 8.8 years and crude mortality was 24.7%. After adjustment for age and sex, self-inflicted burns were independently associated with long-term mortality, Hazard Ratio= 2.08 (95% CI 1.13–3.83). Post hoc analysis showed that the effect was most pronounced during the first years after discharge although it was noticeable over the whole study period. Long-term risk of mortality after discharge from a burn centre was higher in patients with self-inflicted burns than in patients with accidental burns. The effect was noticeable over the whole study period although it was most pronounced during the first years after discharge.",68

This study aimed to (a) document acute and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in parents of children with various life-threatening illnesses; (b) identify trajectory patterns of parental PTSS and recovery over 18 months; (c) determine psychosocial, demographic, and illness factors associated with trajectory group membership.In total, 159 parents (115 mothers, 44 fathers) from 122 families participated in a prospective, longitudinal study that assessed parent psychological responses across four time points-at diagnosis, and 3, 6, and 18 months later. Children were admitted to the Cardiology, Oncology, and Pediatric Intensive Care Departments in a tertiary pediatric hospital. The primary outcome was parent PTSS.Three distinct parent recovery profiles were identified-""Resilient,"" ""Recovery,"" and ""Chronic."" The ""Resilient"" class (33%) showed low distress responses across the trajectory period, whereas the ""Recovery"" class (52%) showed significantly higher levels of distress at the time of diagnosis that gradually declined over the first months following their child's illness. Both of these classes nevertheless remained within the normative range throughout. In contrast, the ""Chronic"" class (13%) was consistently high in severity, remaining within the clinical range across the entire period. Psychosocial factors such as mood, anxiety, and emotional responses predicted group membership, whereas demographic and illness factors did not.Parents show considerable resilience in the face of children's life-threatening illnesses.

Studies utilizing the Burn Model System (BMS) National Database show adult minority patients report worse psychosocial outcomes during burn recovery in domains such as body image or social re-integration. No study to date has investigated differences in psychosocial outcomes by racial or ethnic category in the pediatric population using the BMS database. This study examines eight outcomes in minority pediatric patients to better characterize potential differences in the pediatric patient population. Methods Patients under 18 years old treated for burn injury between 2009 and 2019 consented to participate in a multi-center longitudinal study were included in the current sample. We analyzed eight outcomes using the National Institute of Health Toolbox and PROMIS-25 measures with higher reported scores indicating worse symptom severity. Multi-level, linear mixed effects, regression modeling analyzed associations between race/ethnicity and outcomes at three time points (discharge after index hospitalization, 6- and 12- month post-injury. Results The total cohort of 277 patients were 81% male (n = 182) and on average 8.78 years old (range: 3-18 years at time of injury). When surveyed 12 months after injury, pediatric Hispanic patients reported a mean fatigue score of 45.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 41.6, 49.9) compared to pediatric non-Hispanic patient score of 43.0 (95% CI: 37.1, 48.9). At 12 months, Hispanic patients reported a mean anxiety score of 46.1 (95% CI: 42.7, 49.5), compared to 41.4 (95% CI: 25.8, 47.1) reported by non-Hispanic patients. At 12 months after injury, Hispanic patients reported a mean peer relationship score of 51.1 (95% CI: 47.2, 55.1) compared to non-Hispanic patients' score of 55.5 (95% CI: 50.3, 60.6). Hispanic patients also reported a mean pain interference score of 44.7 (95% CI: 42.3, 47.0) compared to non-Hispanic patients' score of 38.3 (95% CI: 34.9, 41.6) at 12 months after injury. Conclusions Following burn injury, pediatric Hispanic patients report worse outcomes in several psychosocial domains compared to pediatric non-Hispanic patients, although differences were not statistically significant. However, as significant differences in outcomes exist in adult Hispanic/Latino patients, this study supports the need for further evaluation into potential factors that lead to worse outcomes in Hispanic populations. Applicability of Research to Practice Although pediatric Hispanic patients do not report significantly worse outcomes than non-Hispanic patients in short term burn recovery, these patients may benefit from further counseling and psychosocial support after injury.",69

Although such deteriorations in SRH are related to various consequences of sTBI, the effect of posttraumatic reactions (i.e., posttraumatic stress [PTS] symptoms) has been tested insufficiently to date, especially among civilians. The present investigation is based on Trajectories of Recovery After Severe Traumatic brain injury-Matters In families (TRAST-MI), a unique study among civilians with sTBI and their families. Previous research revealed that civilian sTBI has effects beyond the injured patient, influencing their close relatives as well. The aim of this study was to assess the association between PTS symptoms and SRH among patients with civilian sTBI and their close relatives.Patients with sTBI (assessed by an Abbreviated Injury Scale of the head region score >3) and their close relatives participated in TRAST-MI. One hundred twenty-six patient-relative dyads were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months after the injury.Multilevel modeling revealed that patients' PTS symptoms were associated with consequent SRH (slope = 0.42; p < .001), and relatives' PTS symptoms were associated with their respective SRH (slope = 0.2; p = .012).The findings of this study reveal that SRH of both patients with sTBI and their relatives are negatively affected by their own PTS symptoms. These findings underline the understanding that sTBI is not merely a medical trauma but rather a comprehensive psychosocial trauma, which has consequences for the whole family system.",69

This prospective study examined the frequency, timing of onset, symptom profile, and trajectory of PTSD and its psychiatric comorbidities during the first 4 years following moderate-to-severe TBI. Participants were 85 individuals (78.8% male) with moderate or severe TBI recruited following admission to acute rehabilitation between 2005 and 2010. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Disorders (SCID-I), participants were evaluated for pre- and post-injury PTSD soon after injury and reassessed at 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years post-injury. Over the first 4 years post-injury, 17.6% developed injury-related PTSD, none of whom had PTSD prior to injury. PTSD onset peaked between 6 and 12 months post-injury. The majority of PTSD cases (66.7%) had a delayed-onset, which for a third was preceded by subsyndromal symptoms in the first 6 months post-injury. PTSD frequency increased over the first year post-injury, remained stable during the second year, and gradually declined thereafter. The majority of subjects with PTSD experienced a chronic symptom course and all developed one or more than one comorbid psychiatric disorder, with mood, other anxiety, and substance-use disorders being the most common. Despite event-related amnesia, post-traumatic stress symptoms, including vivid re-experiencing phenomena, may develop following moderate-to-severe TBI. Onset is typically delayed and symptoms may persist for several years post-injury.",69

Predictions were based on a wide selection of demographic and clinical assessments including age, gender, comorbid psychiatric disorders, trauma history, posttraumatic symptoms, posttraumatic cognitions, depressive symptoms, general psychopathology and psychosocial functioning.We found that demographic and clinical variables significantly, but only modestly predicted PTSD treatment outcome at discharge (r = 0.21, p = .021 for the best model) and follow-up (r = 0.31, p = .026). Among the included variables, more severe posttraumatic cognitions were negatively associated with treatment outcome. Early response in PTSD symptomatology (percentage change of symptom scores after 4 weeks of treatment) allowed more accurate predictions of outcome at discharge (r = 0.56, p < .001) and follow-up (r = 0.43, p = .001).Our results underscore the importance of early treatment response for short- and long-term treatment success.

Las predicciones se basaron en una amplia selección de evaluaciones demográficas y clínicas que incluyen edad, género, trastornos psiquiátricos comórbidos, antecedentes de trauma, síntomas postraumáticos, cogniciones postraumáticas, síntomas depresivos, psicopatología general y funcionamiento psicosocial.Resultados: Encontramos que las variables clínicas y demográficas predijeron de manera significativa, pero solo modestamente, el resultado del tratamiento del TEPT al momento del alta (r = 0.21, p= .21 para el mejor modelo) y el seguimiento (r = 0.31, p = .026). Entre las variables incluidas, las cogniciones postraumáticas más severas se asociaron negativamente con el resultado del tratamiento. La respuesta temprana en la sintomatología de TEPT (cambio porcentual del puntaje en los síntomas después de cuatro semanas de tratamiento) permitió predicciones más precisas de los resultados al alta (r = 0.56, p < .001) y el seguimiento (r = 0.43, p = .001).Conclusiones: Nuestros resultados subrayan la importancia de una respuesta temprana al tratamiento para el éxito del tratamiento a corto y largo plazo.

Method: Data were collected from 3,003 veterans (20.5% women). Genderstratified logistic models examined the association between alcohol consumption pattern and the odds of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and suicidality. Two types of models were tested: four-group models comparing moderate drinkers to nondrinkers, light, and heavy drinkers; and five-group models separating nondrinkers by AUD history. Results: In four-group models for both genders, compared with moderate drinkers, hazardous drinkers were more likely to have psychiatric symptoms. Among men, nondrinkers were more likely to have symptoms of depression and suicidality but not PTSD. Among women, nondrinkers and light drinkers were more likely to have PTSDsymptoms. In the five-group model for men, odds of symptoms were higher for nondrinkers with an AUD history and hazardous drinkers. Compared to nondrinkers without an AUD history and light drinkers, male nondrinkers with an AUD history had higher odds of psychiatric symptoms. In the five-group model for women, the odds of symptoms were higher for hazardous drinkers. Female nondrinkers with an AUD history had higher odds of a positive depression screen. Odds of a positive PTSD screen were higher for female nondrinkers (with and without an AUD history) and light drinkers. Conclusions: For male veterans, there was a protective effect of moderate drinking (compared with abstinence) that disappeared when nondrinkers without an AUD history were separated. However, results for women showed a protective effect of moderate drinking with regard to PTSD that persisted even when an AUD history was taken into account. (J. Stud.

Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models analyzed the effect of parental stress and anxiety on time in clinic (days between clinic presentation and discharge) and recovery time (days between concussion and clinic discharge). Thematic analysis was used to analyze interview data.Parental anxiety was not significantly related to either the child's time in clinic (P = 0.27) or recovery time (P = 0.41). Conversely, higher perceived parental stress was related to longer recovery time (Hazard Ratio: 2.162, 95% CI: 1.075, 4.348; p = 0.03) for the injured child, with similar results for time in clinic (Hazard Ratio: 1.883, 95% CI: 0.966, 3.668, p = 0.06). During the interview, parents expressed their stress was directly tied to their child's symptoms and overall functioning and varied throughout recovery.Recovery time is significantly longer in concussed children whose parents are experiencing higher levels of stress, but not pre-existing anxiety, following injury. Parental stress varies throughout recovery, with stress generally higher in the acute post-injury period. Clinicians should monitor parental stress post-concussion when possible.",69

Then, associations between established profiles and mental health outcomes were examined, covarying for demographic and trauma-related variables.Results: Considering fit statistics, class size, profile patterns, and theory, the four-class model was deemed most appropriate: High Overall Coping (HCOPE; n = 146, 34%), Low Overall Coping (LCOPE; n = 92, 22%), High Engagement Coping (HENG; n = 115, 27%), and High Disengagement Coping (HDIS; n = 73, 17%). HENG participants endorsed above-average resilience and PTG, coupled with below-average depressive symptoms and PTSS. Compared to the sample average, HDIS participants endorsed lower resilience and PTG, coupled with higher depressive symptoms and PTSS. LCOPE participants endorsed low levels of all outcomes. HCOPE participants endorsed high levels of all outcomes.Conclusions: Findings suggest that clinicians who promote engagement coping and discourage disengagement coping among trauma-exposed individuals may engender the most desirable constellation of mental health outcomes.",69

Methods Questionnaire study regarding prior exposure to traumatic events, PTSD, postpartum depression (PPD) and fear of childbirth among women two to 12 months postpartum, recruited via targeted internet sites. Results Questionnaires were completed by 143 women, with PPD reported by 22 (15.4%), probable PTSD by 11 (7.7%), and fear of childbirth by 14 (9.8%). Overall, 97 (67.8%) women reported a prior traumatic event: 16 (16.5%) reported the recent delivery to be the worst traumatic event and that symptoms began subsequent to this delivery; 17 (17.5%) reported the worst traumatic event was not the recent delivery but symptoms had started postpartum. Significantly higher symptom levels suggestive of PTSD and PPD were found in women whose trauma event was not delivery, yet symptoms started postpartum. Women whose traumatic event pre-dated the delivery also showed significantly higher symptom levels of PTSD. More than half of those describing PTSD related to the recent delivery presented with clinically relevant levels of fear of childbirth, compared with less than a third of women whose PTSD was related to a different event. Conclusion PTSD identified postpartum may not be linked to the recent delivery and often pre-dates it. Future studies should identify the trigger traumatic event responsible for PTSD symptoms, to enable a more accurate picture of the reasons for PTSD and fear of childbirth.",69

Methods Participants were WTC responders—8034 police and 8352 non‐traditional (eg, construction workers)—with one or more children at the time of their first visit to the World Trade Center Health Program (WTC‐HP). Self‐report questionnaires were administered approximately 4 years after the 9/11 WTC attack. Results A total of 31.4% of non‐traditional and 20.0% of police responders reported behavioral problems in their children. Non‐traditional responder status, female sex, Hispanic ethnicity, more life stressors, more WTC‐related PTSD symptoms, and dysphoric arousal symptoms were significant correlates of behavioral problems in responders’ children. Conclusions Specific parental sociodemographic, psychosocial and clinical characteristics, as well as PTSD symptom severity, were significant correlates of child behavior problems. Findings encourage monitoring and early intervention for children of disaster responders, particularly those at highest risk.",69

Most first responders experienced few or no PTSD symptoms.AP Photo/Beth A. KeiserRobert Pietrzak, Ph.D., M.P.H., an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University, and Adriana Feder, M.D., an associate professor of psychiatry at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, have been trying to better understand PTSD and other mental health trajectories in WTC responders. In their work, they have collaborated with other researchers at the WTC Health Program, a consortium of five centers established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in 2002 that provides treatment and medical monitoring for 9/11 responders.Just as the WTC attacks were unprecedented in scope, so too was the response needed on the morning of the attacks and in their aftermath, bringing together police and paramedics with construction workers and asbestos handlers. The number and diversity of WTC responders, as well their willingness to share their experiences with researchers, has made it possible to uncover nuanced details about WTC-related PTSD trajectories, Pietrzak said.“It’s not a simple matter of you have PTSD or you don’t,” Pietrzak said. “We’ve uncovered considerable heterogeneity in the severity of this disorder and how it evolves over time.”Pietrzak and Feder recently published a study in the Journal of Psychiatric Research that describes the heterogeneity of PTSD reported by professional and nontraditional responders 12 years after 9/11. The study included 1,874 police and 2,613 other responders involved during and after the WTC attacks. As part of a health survey, the responders were given the PTSD Checklist Specific-Stressor (PCL-S) three, six, eight, and 12 years after 9/11. Participants also answered questions about various life stressors that took place in the year before and since 9/11.For police responders, WTC-related PTSD symptoms grouped into four distinct trajectories, and for nonpolice responders, five distinct PTSD symptom trajectories emerged over time (see chart).Many variables were consistent predictors of PTSD trajectories across both responder groups; for example, Hispanic ethnicity, psychiatric history prior to 9/11, greater exposure to the devastation caused by the WTC attacks, and maladaptive coping (such as substance use) strongly increased the risk of a symptomatic PTSD trajectory (everything but no/low symptoms). In contrast, higher perceived preparedness and a greater sense of purpose lowered the risk of symptomatic PTSD.In another study, Pietrzak and his colleagues also identified a set of three typologies that comprise WTC-related PTSD. About 45 percent of responders with PTSD generally experienced all symptoms, while 31 percent had “dysphoric” PTSD that was characterized by emotional numbing and unease as the predominant symptoms, and 23 percent were part of a “threat” typology characterized by hypervigilance and avoidance.“These predictors can help tell us how to prepare a diverse workforce to respond to a large-magnitude disaster,” Feder told Psychiatric News. “For example, rescue workers can be screened for their risk to identify people better suited for supportive instead of frontline roles that may experience more trauma.”Feder, Pietrzak, and colleagues are also searching for biomarkers that may identify PTSD resilience. They have conducted more extensive interviews with over 300 responders from their cohort, who have also provided blood samples that will be used to measure stress hormone levels as well as the expression of stress-related genes. Other groups have turned to WTC responders for clues about the effects of PTSD across the lifespan. For example, Sean Clouston, Ph.D., of Stony Brook University has been monitoring a subset of responders who live on Long Island to explore the role of PTSD in the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.“There is burgeoning interest in trauma and aging, suggesting some important connections between PTSD and dementia,” said Pietrzak, who’s been collaborating with Clouston on this endeavor. “Particularly, it involves the continual re-experiencing of past events that uses up a lot of cortical resources and may contribute to cognitive problems down the road for WTC responders.”Another research team, led by Christina Hoven, Ph.D., M.P.H., of Columbia University is exploring the younger age spectrum and assessing the children of WTC responders to evaluate the generational effects of 9/11.The real value of all this epidemiological data may be in how it can inform prevention and treatment for PTSD. Feder and Pietrzak noted that they just received a new grant to test a potential therapy. They will conduct a randomized trial of an Internet-based writing program that uses a novel, trauma-focused psychotherapy to help WTC responders find meaning in their trauma—testing whether sense of purpose can reduce PTSD symptoms. “We are really excited to get the chance to apply some of our findings in therapy and see if we can improve some people’s lives,” Feder said. ■An abstract of “Risk, Coping, and PTSD Symptom Trajectories in World Trade Center Responders” can be accessed here.

The WTC Health Registry has followed up a large number of individuals, including police officers, at three waves of data collection from 2003 to 2011. This analysis examines the relationship between initial exposure levels, long-term PTSD symptoms, and subsequent emotional support among police responders.The study population included police responders who had reported their 9/11 exposure levels at Wave 1 (2003/4), provided three waves of data on PTSD symptoms using the 17-item PCL scale, and rated their received emotional support at Wave 3 (N = 2,204, 1,908 men, 296 women, mean age: 38 years at exposure). A second-order growth curve reflected a PTSD symptom trajectory which was embedded in a structural equation model, with exposure level specified as an exogenous predictor, and emotional support specified as an endogenous outcome.Exposure had a main effect on mean symptom levels (intercept) across three waves but it made no difference in changes in symptoms (slope), and no difference in emotional support. The symptom trajectory, on the other hand, had an effect on emotional support. Its intercept and slope were both related to support, indicating that changes in symptoms affected later emotional support.Initial trauma exposure levels can have a long-term effect on mean symptom levels. Emotional support is lower in police responders when PTSD symptoms persist over seven years, but becomes higher when reduction in symptoms occurs.",70

It also examines the moderating effect of participants’ age, gender, and parental socialization styles on the relationship between EPV and PTSS. A systematic cluster random sample of 2,934 Palestinian adolescents aged 14 to 19 years living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem responded to self-administered questionnaires. Multiple regression analysis showed a positive relationship between levels of EPV and of PTSS. Girls showed higher levels of PTSS than boys. Hostile and rejecting parenting styles, strict discipline, and negative evaluation from parents correlated positively with high PTSS, whereas intimate and loving parenting correlated with low levels of PTSS, supporting the hypotheses presented here. The chapter discusses the importance of intimate and loving parenting styles as a possible protective factor for mitigating the effects of political violence on children.",70

A pilot investigation,"Abstract Risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is high in rescue workers. But prevalence differs depending on the occupational group and other deployment-related factors. Though canine search and rescue teams represent a significant part of the rescue worker professional group, research concerning their mental health is scarce. The aim of the study was to investigate mental health and its correlates in dog handlers. Members of the German Federal Association of Canine Search and Rescue completed online questionnaires regarding PTSD and mental health complaints as well as mission-related experiences and availability of psychosocial support after critical missions. In N = 116 individuals, 10% met the threshold indicative of a diagnosis for PTSD. 12% and 6% reported clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. PTSD and anxiety were associated with higher traumatic load throughout the lifetime but lower exposure to job-related stressful events. Regular internal debriefing after critical missions was existent in almost all teams (89%), but only 32% reported procedures outside the local squadrons. Internal debriefing was not associated with less PTSD symptoms, but with lower levels of both anxiety and depression. The findings confirm an increased risk for mental health problems also for canine search and rescue teams. Mission-related correlates as well as debriefing sessions were narrowly associated with PTSD. The results point to the importance of further investigating the needs of this special rescue profession and the identification of risk factors for PTSD and mental health distress specifically in this sample that can be targeted in interventions.",70

However, it is unclear whether these traits are preexisting risk factors or if event-related changes might also be associated with PTSD symptoms over time. Therefore, the current aim was to assess if military deployment is associated with changes in cooperativeness and self-directedness and to study how these traits are related to PTSD symptom trajectories.In a large cohort of military personnel (N = 1007), measurements were performed before, at one and six months, and two and five years after deployment to Afghanistan. Linear mixed-effect models were used to assess the individual change in the traits over time and to study the relation with potential predictors.Cooperativeness was found to remain stable, whereas self-directedness was found to slightly decrease over time. This decrease was related to the development of PTSD symptoms over time. Furthermore, lower levels of self-directedness were associated with the symptomatic trajectories of PTSD symptoms. Lower levels of cooperativeness were only associated with the recovered PTSD trajectory.So, not only do the findings confirm that lower levels of these character traits are associated with the development of PTSD symptoms, it was also shown that there are differences in the relation between these traits and the course of PTSD symptoms. Studying methods to promote the levels of these character traits might help to improve the resiliency of military personnel.",70

This study aims to evaluate the trajectory of functional outcome and health status up to five years after moderate to major trauma in Hong Kong. Methods We report the five year follow up results of a multicentre, prospective cohort from the trauma registries of three regional trauma centres in Hong Kong. The original cohort recruited 400 adult trauma patients with ISS ≥ 9. Telephone follow up was conducted longitudinally at seven time points, and the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) and Short-Form 36 (SF36) were tracked. Results 119 out of 309 surviving patients (39%) completed follow up after 5 years. The trajectory of GOSE, PCS and MCS showed gradual improvements over the seven time points. 56/119 (47.1%) patients reported a GOSE = 8 (upper good recovery), and the mean PCS and MCS was 47.8 (95% CI 45.8, 49.9) and 55.8 (95% CI 54.1, 57.5) respectively at five years. Univariate logistic regression showed change in PCS - baseline to 1 year and 1 year to 2 years, and change in MCS - baseline to 1 year were associated with GOSE = 8 at 5 years. Linear mixed effects model showed differences in PCS and MCS were greatest between 1-month and 6-month follow up. Conclusions After injury, the most rapid improvement in PCS and MCS occurred in the first six to 12 months, but further recovery was still evident for MCS in patients aged under 65 years for up to five years.",70

The present study examined whether weekly changes in blame predicted subsequent changes in PTSD symptoms over the course of cognitive processing therapy (CPT). Participants consisted of 321 active duty U.S. Army soldiers with PTSD who received CPT in one of two clinical trials. Symptoms of PTSD and blame were assessed at baseline and weekly throughout treatment. Bivariate latent difference score modeling was used to examine temporal sequential dependencies between the constructs. Results indicated that changes in self-blame and PTSD symptoms were dynamically linked: When examining cross-construct predictors, changes in PTSD symptoms were predicted by prior changes in self-blame, but changes in self-blame were also predicted by both prior levels of and prior changes in PTSD. Changes in other-blame were predicted by prior levels of PTSD, but changes in other-blame did not predict changes in PTSD symptoms. Findings highlight the dynamic relationship between self-blame and PTSD symptoms during treatment in this active military sample.",70

Evidence on risk factors of birth-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in mothers is increasing, whereas fathers are less examined. This study aims to determine differential predictors of PTSD symptoms in mothers and fathers. Data derive from the DREAM study, including 1,146 mothers and 828 fathers. We assessed mental health, work, and sociodemographic factors during pregnancy, pregnancy- and birth-related factors, and birth-related PTSD symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised 8 weeks postpartum. Structural equation models were estimated to examine associations between predictors and latent factors of PTSD symptoms for mothers and fathers simultaneously. Scaled chi-square difference tests were used to investigate differences between both groups in predictors. Clinically relevant birth-related PTSD symptoms were found in 2.3% of mothers and 0.7% of fathers. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, pregnancy complications, and poorer subjective birth experience predicted PTSD symptoms in both groups. Additionally, lower support during birth and an unplanned cesarean section predicted PTSD symptoms in mothers, whereas lower job satisfaction, higher job burden, being first-time father, lower education, and mothers’ lower support during birth were predictors for fathers. We found significant differences between groups regarding job burden during pregnancy, support during birth, and an unplanned cesarean section. Generalization of findings might be limited by self-selection bias and some systematic dropout. Our results suggest differential predictors of PTSD symptoms in mothers and fathers. For fathers, less examined factors such as work factors may be important. Identifying differential risk factors may lead to customized prevention and treatment offers.",70
https://openalex.org/W2736939809,10.31390/gradschool_dissertations.3233,Effects of family violence and parental psychopathology on the psychological outcome of urban adolescents exposed to community violence,"Previous research has documented an association between adolescents’ exposure to community violence and a range of mental health problems. However, some violence-exposed youth maintain high levels of adaptive behavior and exhibit good psychological functioning. Thus, it appears that protective and/or risk factors are involved in the community violence-psychological outcome relation, which mitigate the conditions under which community violence exposure leads to adverse adolescent outcome. According to the ecological transactional model, protective and/or risk factors may exist within the family that influence adolescent outcome in response to community violence exposure. The purpose of this study was to delineate the relations among community violence exposure and family factors, including family violence and parental psychopathology, on adolescent psychological symptomatology and personal adjustment. Participants consisted of 121 pairs of junior high or high school students and their parent/guardian. Adolescents completed the Screen for Adolescent Violence Exposure, the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, and the Behavior Assessment System for Children-Self Report of Personality. The parents/guardians competed a Demographic Questionnaire, the Behavior Assessment System for Children-Parent Report, the Symptom Checklist-90-R, and the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted and results indicated that family violence exposure did not serve as a moderator variable in the association between adolescent community violence exposure and positive or negative adolescent outcome. In contrast, parental psychopathology was found to be a moderator variable in the relationship between community violence exposure and adolescent-rated PTSD and psychological distress, but not in the relationship between community violence exposure and parent-rated adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems or adolescent-rated personal adjustment. Clinical implications and limitations of this study are discussed.",70

A total of 1573 adolescent survivors of the 8-magnitude Wenchuan earthquake were assessed through the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (cutoff for probable clinical depression: 15), Social Support Rate Scale, Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist, and a self-designed questionnaire covering earthquake exposure and demographic information at 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 30-months after the earthquake. Data were analyzed using growth mixture modeling (GMM) and multinomial logistic regression. The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms were 27.6%, 40.6%, 30.9%, 37.5% and 29.8% at 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 30-months, respectively. GMM analysis showed four patterns of growth curves for depressive symptoms: chronic depression (25.6% of the sample), recovery (1.7%), delayed depression (4.3%), and resilience (68.4%). Female gender was related with decreased probability of resilience. Direct witness of tragic scenes during the earthquake was related with higher risk for chronic depression. More negative life events and fewer social support were also common predictors of not developing the resilience pattern. The need of providing appropriate individualized interventions for high-risk adolescent earthquake survivors is indicated.",70

We examined parenting stress and parenting behavior quality as mediators of the relation between maternal PTSD and problematic child behaviors in a sample at high risk for trauma exposure. We also examined whether child sex moderated this association.Participants were 141 African American mother-child dyads (children aged 8-12). Mothers reported PTSD severity, parenting stress, and child behavior (externalizing, internalizing, and emotional self-control). Parenting behavior quality (accounting for factors including parental warmth and engagement) was assessed from an observational parent-child interaction task.Parenting stress, but not observed parenting behavior quality, mediated the relation between maternal PTSD severity and child behaviors. Child sex moderated this association, such that the effect was stronger for girls.Maternal PTSD may be associated with negative child behavior outcomes, and this relation appears to be mediated by increased parenting stress. Stress-reducing interventions for parents with PTSD could improve child outcomes, especially for girls. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",70

The current study aims to identify traumatic stress symptom trajectories during conflict, as well as potential risk factors. Experience sampling methods were used to study traumatic stress symptoms during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict in 100 Israeli civilians exposed to rocket fire. Summary reports of traumatic symptoms were made twice-daily for 30 days via mobile phone. Latent class growth analysis revealed four distinct classes (low, reducing, moderate, and high) characterised by their trajectory of traumatic stress symptoms during the conflict. Female gender, not being in a relationship, and higher prior trauma exposure were identified as potential risk factors. Data were not collected in the early phase of the conflict, the sample was relatively small, and only traumatic stress symptoms were investigated as outcomes. This study identified heterogeneous traumatic stress symptom trajectories among civilians during a conflict, with different subgroups showing distinct response patterns over time, associated with various risk factors. Investigating responses to ongoing trauma, and identifying predictors of different stress symptom trajectories has clinical implications for the targeted delivery of interventions. Further exploration of heterogeneous trajectories could potentially elucidate mechanisms that drive resilience and recovery, including in situations of ongoing exposure such as during conflict.",71

Using the Resilience Portfolio Model as a framework, this study explores a range of psychological and social strengths in a community sample of youth from the southern U.S.A sample of 440 youth aged 10 to 21 (average age 16.38, SD = 3.04) was recruited from youth-serving organizations. They completed a survey on trauma symptoms, victimization, other adversities, and 16 psychological and social strengths.Almost 9 in 10 (89.3%) youth reported one or more victimizations, with peer victimizations most common. Adult-perpetrated offenses were reported by almost half of youth (47.1%). Although several psychological and social strengths were inversely correlated with trauma symptoms at the bivariate level, hierarchical regressions indicated that a sense of purpose was the only strength that uniquely contributed to more resilient mental health in a model with all strengths and controlling for victimization, other adversities, poverty, age, and gender (total R2 = .33). The variance explained by strengths (17%) was similar to the variance explained by adversities (15%).In this highly victimized sample of youth, many strengths were associated with lower trauma symptoms for youth, with a sense of purpose showing the most promise. Prevention and intervention programs may benefit from efforts to increase a sense of purpose or other meaning making activities, in addition to efforts that specifically target incidents of trauma.",71

This study adopted a transdiagnostic approach with the aim of identifying psychological processes common to depression, anxiety and global distress after TBI. Fifty participants with TBI (aged 19–66 years, 12–65 months post-injury) completed measures of threat appraisals and avoidance behaviour (Appraisal of Threat and Avoidance Questionnaire), self-discrepancy (Head Injury Semantic Differential Scale III), emotion dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale), worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), negative self-focused attention (Self-Focus Sentence Completion) and emotional distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and Brief Symptom Inventory). Significant correlations were found among the proposed transdiagnostic variables (rs = .29–.82, p < .05). A principal components analysis revealed two underlying factors: (1) Threats to Self, and (2) Emotion Dysregulation. Only the Emotion Dysregulation factor accounted for significant unique variance in levels of depression, anxiety and global distress (sr2 = .12–.17). Such findings indicate the need for interventions to target difficulties in identifying and regulating emotions after TBI to facilitate emotional adjustment.",71

Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention study participants completed headache diaries during a 28-day baseline period and a 168-day active treatment period during which youth took amitriptyline, topiramate, or placebo. Daily headache occurrence trajectories were established across baseline and active treatment periods using longitudinal hierarchical linear modeling. We tested potential treatment group differences. We also compared final models to trajectory findings from a clinical trial of cognitive behavioral therapy plus amitriptyline for youth with chronic migraine to test for reproducibility.Daily headache occurrence showed stability across baseline. Active treatment models revealed decreases in headache frequency that were most notable early in the trial period. Baseline and active treatment models did not differ by treatment group and replicated trajectory cognitive behavioral therapy plus amitriptyline trial findings.Replicating headache frequency trajectories across clinical trials provides strong evidence that youth can improve quickly.

https://openalex.org/W2913059910,10.1002/imhj.21768,Maternal experience of their infants’ crying in the context of war trauma: Determinants and consequences,"ABSTRACT We examined, first, how prenatal maternal mental health and war trauma predicted mothers’ experience of their infant crying, indicated by emotions, cognitions, and behavior; and second, how these experiences influenced the mother–infant interaction and infant development. Participants were 511 Palestinian mothers from the Gaza Strip, reporting their war trauma, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and perceived stress during pregnancy (Time 1). They reported experiences of infant crying at 4 months (Time 2), and the mother–infant interaction and infant sensorimotor and language development at 12 months of infants’ age (Time 3). Results revealed that maternal mental health problems, but not war trauma, were important to experiences of infant crying. A high level of PTSD symptoms predicted negative emotions evoked by infant crying, and high depressive symptoms predicted low active and positive responses to crying. Unexpectedly, high prenatal perceived stress predicted high active and positive responsiveness. Concerning the consequences, mothers’ sensitive interpretation of infant crying predicted optimal infant sensorimotor development, and mothers’ active and positive responses predicted high emotional availability in mother–infant interaction. Crying is the first communication tool for infants, and mothers’ sensitive responses to crying contribute to infant well‐being. Therefore, reinforcing mother's optimal responses is important when helping war‐affected dyads.",71

Using the PubMed and Scopus databases, we performed a systematic review of recent cross-sectional studies between 2016 and 2022, investigating the associations of PTSD and trauma with the social and mental behavior of adolescents. Fifty-three articles were initially identified. Due to duplication, eight articles were excluded, leaving 45 remaining articles. In addition, 34 articles were excluded due to year of publication, review, abstract, or irrelevant title. Seven articles were included in this systematic review after excluding the remaining due to different study types or samples. Included studies primarily examined the associations of PTSD symptomatology and expression of externalizing symptoms with risky behavior and the commission of a crime. The strongest outcomes were increased levels of violent behavior, violent delinquency, and total risk in correlation with PTSD symptoms, emotional numbing, use of drugs, and in some cases maltreatment. The results of the systematic review suggest that PTSD symptoms and risky behavior, which can be also fueled by maltreatment activities in the family circle, are associated with criminal behavior. Future research is needed to confirm these findings.",71

More specifically, we sought to evaluate whether PD differentially predicts PTSD according to the degree of exposure to the potentially traumatic event (PTE), the level of education, and gender. A total of 120 individuals between 17 and 75 years of age, including 51 women, completed the Traumatic Events List, the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, and the French version of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale, as well as a questionnaire providing information regarding sociodemographic details. The group of participants with high scores for PD had significantly more PTSD. PD differentially predicts PTSD depending on the level of education and gender of the individual. Those who had been physically assaulted and raped, as well as the less educated, were more likely to be dissociated during PTE· exposure compared to witnesses and those with a higher level of education. The primary target population for prevention and early management should comprise individuals with high levels of PD, low levels of education, and women.",71

Methods: A sample consisted of 502 randomly selected subjects from five areas of the Gaza Strip. Measures for collecting data include Stressful Situations due to Siege Scale, Gaza Traumatic Events Checklist, Brief Symptom Checklist-BSI-19, World Health Organization Quality of Life, and Resilience scale. Results: The most common stressful situations due siege were: feelings of being living in a big prison cannot finish some construction and repair work in their house due to shortage of cement and building materials, prices were sharply increased in the last few years. Participants commonly reported traumatic events such as hearing shelling of the area by artillery, hearing the sonic sounds of the jetfighters, hearing the loud voice of drones, and watching mutilated bodies in TV. Males had significantly experienced severe traumatic events than females. People live in cities reported more traumatic events than those live in a village or a camp. As a reaction to stress and trauma Palestinians participants reported anxiety symptoms such as nervousness or shakiness inside, feeling tense or keyed up; while depression symptoms reported were feeling sad, and weak in parts of their body. However, feelings of worthlessness and thoughts of ending life were seldom. Females reported less stress and trauma, but they showed anxiety and somatization symptoms than males. Only 12.5% said that they evaluate their life as good, and 27.1% said they enjoy their life. Better quality of life is an indicator of wellbeing; females had higher level of quality of life. While, physical health activities of daily living were more in males was. Palestinians used religious ways of coping with the stress and trauma, and 98% said God is helping all the time, they were proud of their achievements, and had strong sense of purpose in their life. There were statistically significant positive relationship between stress due to the siege and closure and traumatic events, psychological symptoms, depression, somatization, and anxiety. However, there was statistically significant negative relationship between total score of stress due to the siege and closure and the total resilience factor and subscales, and quality of life. Total traumatic events were positively correlated with psychological symptoms, depression, somatization, and anxiety. Conclusion and implications: In this study, siege and blockade situation was very stressful. Such stressors due to siege had negative influence families especially older age fathers who live in refugee camp and unemployed and living in poor families. Such findings are trigger to start national and international advocacy campaigns to left the siege on Gaza Strip and allow free movements and association, which may decrease stressors and consequences and improve the economic situation of the families and decrease poverty of the families. Traumatic experiences due to eight days war on Gaza impact on mental health and quality of life highlight the need for developing new training program including subjects such trauma, impact of trauma, stress management, symptoms.",71

To address this research gap, the present study examined whether sleep problems mediated the relationship between earthquake exposure and PTSD symptoms, and whether this mediating process was moderated by resilience. A sample of 1,342 adolescents ( M age = 15.54 years, SD = 1.26) completed questionnaires regarding earthquake exposure, sleep problems, resilience, and PTSD symptoms 12 months after a devastating earthquake in China. After controlling for demographic variables, earthquake exposure was significantly, and positively associated with PTSD symptoms, and sleep problems partially mediated this relationship. Tests of moderated mediation further revealed that resilience moderated the relationship between earthquake exposure and PTSD symptoms as well as sleep problems and PTSD symptoms. Specifically, the relationship between earthquake exposure and PTSD symptoms was only significant for adolescents with a lower level of resilience; meanwhile, the positive relationship between sleep problems and PTSD symptoms was stronger among low-resilient adolescents. Therefore, sleep-targeted and resilience-based interventions may be effective in alleviating PTSD symptoms resulted from the earthquake.",71

It remains critical to understand why these patterns emerge, and under what conditions. Objectives: This study examined whether PTSD symptoms (PTSS) and alcohol involvement (quantity and frequency of use, heavy episodic drinking, and alcohol problems) are indirectly related through four distinct drinking motivations. A secondary aim was to identify factors, specifically forms of social support, which buffer these associations. Methods: Using baseline data from a randomized-controlled trial of health and well-being among civilian-employed separated service members and reservists, the present study examined these issues using a subsample of 398 current drinkers. Results: Parallel mediation models revealed PTSS–alcohol consumption associations were indirect through coping and enhancement motivations. PTSS was only related to alcohol problems through coping motivations. In addition, the indirect effect of PTSS on average level of consumption via coping motives was conditional on perceived support from friends and family, whereas the indirect effect for alcohol problems was conditional only on friend support. In contrast, the indirect effects of PTSS on alcohol consumption variables (but not problems) via enhancement motives were conditional on perceived support from friends and family. Conclusions/Importance: Future research and screening efforts should attend to individual motivations for drinking as important factors related to alcohol use and problems among service members experiencing PTSS, and emphasize the importance of communication, trust, and effective supports among military and nonmilitary friends and family.",71

Much of the literature assessing risk and protective factors related to children’s post-disaster recovery has primarily focused on the development of significant clinical symptoms, largely ignoring factors associated with positive adjustment and resilience. The purpose of the current investigation was to examine parenting behaviors and family organization (i.e., child routines) as they relate to children’s self-esteem and self-reliance in a sample of 371 parent-child dyads impacted by Hurricane Katrina. A series of hierarchical regression analyses tested the hypotheses that parenting behaviors and child routines are predictive of self-esteem and self-reliance in an attempt to elucidate the relationship between family-level variables and children’s post-disaster adjustment at two time points (i.e., 3-7 and 13-17 months) following Hurricane Katrina. While hypotheses were partially supported, significant relationships were small. Results indicated that home violence exposure was the strongest predictor of self-esteem (B = -1.81, p < .05) and corporal punishment (B= .57, p < .05) was the strongest predictor of self-reliance 3-7 months post-disaster. Minority status (B = 3.47, p < .05), child gender (B = -2.74, p < .05), and poor monitoring/supervision (B = -.38, p < .05) were significant predictors of self-esteem 13-17 months post-disaster. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.",71

However, few prospective studies in high-risk samples delineate distinct trajectories of internalizing symptoms from preschool age onward. We examined trajectories in a high-risk cohort, oversampled for internalizing symptoms, several preschool risk/maintenance factors, and school-age outcomes. Parents of 325 children completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire on up to four waves of data collection from preschool (3-5 years) to school age (8-9 years) and Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment interviews at both ages. Multi-informant data were collected on risk factors and symptoms. Growth mixture modelling identified four trajectory classes of internalizing symptoms with stable low, rising low-to-moderate, stable moderate, and stable high symptoms. Children in the stable high symptom trajectory manifested clinically relevant internalizing symptoms, mainly diagnosed with anxiety disorders/depression at preschool and school age. Trajectories differed regarding loss/separation experience, maltreatment, maternal psychopathology, temperament, and stress-hormone regulation with loss/separation, temperament, maternal psychopathology, and stress-hormone regulation (trend) significantly contributing to explained variance. At school age, trajectories continued to differ on symptoms, disorders, and impairment. Our study is among the first to show that severe early adversity may trigger a chronic and neurobiologically distinct internalizing trajectory from preschool age onward.",71

Sustaining injuries on the battlefield can disrupt the reintegration period. The first aim was to follow-up the reintegration attitude towards family, work and on a personal level after deployment in Dutch battlefield casualties (BCs). The second was to compare their postdeployment reintegration attitude with that of healthy controls.A questionnaire concerning reintegration attitude, the Postdeployment Reintegration Scale (PDRS), was provided to all service members who received rehabilitation after sustaining injuries in Op TASK FORCE URUZGAN. The questionnaire was administered in 27 BCs at a median of 2 years post incident and 5.5 years post incident. At 5.5 years post incident, the PDRS of the BCs was compared with a control group consisting of service members from the same combat units.A significant difference was found for the BCs with an increased negative personal attitude (p=0.02) and a decreased negative attitude towards work (p=0.02) at 5.5 years compared with 2 years post incident. No differences in postdeployment reintegration attitude was observed between the BCs and controls at 5.5 years post incident.The results showed that for the BCs the personal attitude becomes more negative in time. However, the negative attitude towards work decreases in time after deployment. Particular attention should be paid to traumatic stress and aftercare.",71

Frequent military deployments generate many occupational and environmental stressors for these citizen-soldiers, from serving in a dangerous zone to being away from family and home for long periods of time. Whereas there is a substantial amount of research focused on deployment-related health outcomes in relation to active duty (i.e., full-time) military populations, reserve forces are less understood. This study focuses on a United States Army National Guard combat unit deployed to Afghanistan. This prospective longitudinal study was conducted over the course an operational deployment cycle (i.e., before, during, and after) to document the evolution of salient mental health outcomes (i.e., post-traumatic stress, depression, general anxiety, and aggression). The findings show that both combat (e.g., killing others) and non-combat (e.g., boredom) stressors negatively affect mental health outcomes, and the severity of these outcomes increases over the course of a deployment cycle. Of special note, the study reveals key gender differences in the evolution of post-traumatic stress (PTS), depression, and anxiety across a deployment cycle: females report increased PTS, depression, and anxiety 6 months post-deployment, whereas the levels reported by males stabilize at their mid-deployment levels. The findings offer insights for medical providers and policymakers in developing more targeted health promotion campaigns and interventions, especially at the post-deployment phase.",72

We tested the utility of group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) for qEEG classification, focusing on the specific example of suppression ratio (SR).We included comatose CA patients hospitalized from April 2010 to October 2014, excluding CA from trauma or neurological catastrophe. We used Persyst®v12 to generate SR trends and used semi-quantitative methods to choose appropriate sampling and averaging strategies. We used GBTM to partition SR data into different trajectories and regression associate trajectories with outcome. We derived a multivariate logistic model using clinical variables without qEEG to predict survival, then added trajectories and/or non-longitudinal SR estimates, and assessed changes in model performance.Overall, 289 CA patients had ≥36 h of EEG yielding 10,404 h of data (mean age 57 years, 81 % arrested out-of-hospital, 33 % shockable rhythms, 31 % overall survival, 17 % discharged to home or acute rehabilitation). We identified 4 distinct SR trajectories associated with survival (62, 26, 12, and 0 %, P < 0.0001 across groups) and CPC (35, 10, 4, and 0 %, P < 0.0001 across groups). Adding trajectories significantly improved model performance compared to adding non-longitudinal data.Longitudinal analysis of continuous qEEG data using GBTM provides more predictive information than analysis of qEEG at single time-points after CA.",72

Design/methodology/approach Gender, age and marital status were collected, along with occupation for civilians and the unit served with, rank, length of time deployed, overall months active and location for veterans. The trauma experiences scale for civilians, the PTSD checklist for civilian and military, Resilience Research Centre’s Adult Resilience Measure-28, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and the Deployment Risk and Resiliency Inventory-2 scales were used. Findings The results revealed for both samples, resilience and social support (except unit support for veterans) impacted PTSD symptoms. However, social support did not mediate the relationship between resilience and PTSD. Practical implications Implications for policy and practice were discussed. Originality/value The originality of this research stems from the incorporation of both a civilian and military sample by comparing their levels of PTSD, resilience and social support.",72

Materials and methods A total of 378 patients from multi modal trauma centers in Bengaluru city were included for the study. A total of 153 patients were those who had disfiguring facial injuries, 111 patients with nondisfiguring facial injuries and 114 patients had sustained a visible extremity injury that was not covered by clothing (disfigurement /scarring). The assessments were carried out at three time intervals (the date of discharge, 1 month postoperatively and 6 months postoperatively) of the follow-up. The impact of events scale (IES), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and changes in sexual functioning questionnaire (CSFQ) were used. Results Statistically significant higher means of IES, HADS (both for anxiety and depression) were present in patients with disfiguring facial injuries compared to patients with nondisfiguring facial injuries and visible extremity injuries and this was present at all three study intervals (date of discharge, 1st postoperative month and 6th postoperative month). There was a statistically significant change in the means of CSFQ scores of visible extremity injuries compared to other groups at the date of discharge bordering on sexual dysfunction, there was a raise in CSFQ scores among all three groups at the 1st postoperative month and the 6th postoperative month which was above the dysfunction cut-off. Conclusion The results of this study led to the conclusion that in comparison with patients who had sustained disfiguring facial injuries, nondisfiguring facial injuries and visible extremity/ orthopedic injuries, the mean IES scores, HADS scores for both anxiety and depression of the facial disfiguring injury patients was higher at all three study intervals (date of discharge, 1st postoperative month and 6 months postoperatively), indicating higher PTSD levels, anxiety and depression in patients with disfiguring facial injuries, CSFQ scores were above the cutoff suggested at the 1st month and 6th month postoperative indicating no sexual dysfunction in all the three groups.

https://openalex.org/W4224085332,10.1037/rep0000447,The longitudinal development of posttraumatic growth among U.S. adult burn injury survivors.,"Posttraumatic growth is the phenomenon of positive change resulting from coping with challenging or traumatic events. This study examines posttraumatic growth (PTG) in adult burn injury survivors via growth trajectories and correlates across time.Three-hundred forty-eight burn injury survivors aged 19-86 years old completed a self-report measure of posttraumatic growth at 6, 12, and 24 months. An unconditional and conditional growth curve model with predictors were fitted to the posttraumatic growth data. Predictors included psychosocial variables (satisfaction with life, stigma, body image, anxiety, depression, and pain), demographic variables (age, education, sex), and burn injury variables (days hospitalized, cause of injury, TBSA burn, and admittance to rehab).On average participants experienced midlevel posttraumatic growth scores and experienced little change across time. Participants' sex, age, educational attainment, burn severity level, satisfaction with life pre-burn injury, and perceived stigma were each significantly associated with initial posttraumatic growth scores.Burn survivors vary in their degree of posttraumatic growth, with growth largely stable by 6 months postinjury. Targeted intervention to facilitate growth, and thus physical health and mental health, should be completed prior to 6 months postinjury. Burn-related stigma may be a modifiable factor that can enhance posttraumatic growth. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",72

With limited empirical data comparing these theories, we examined the relationships between the count of lifetime PTE types and psychological outcomes [posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, impaired distress tolerance] using linear and quadratic regressions. A linear relationship would support the dose-response theory, and a quadratic relationship would support the stress-inoculation theory. We also explored whether there was a threshold number of PTE types fostering resiliency before an increase of distressing outcomes. The sample included 123 (68.30% female) treatment-seeking patients at a community mental health center participating in a larger study (Contractor et al. in Psychiatry Research, 252, 252215–252222, 2017). Linear regression results indicated number of PTE types significantly predicted increasing PTSD and depression severity and distress tolerance difficulties. Quadratic regression model results were not significant. ROC analyses indicated exposure to at least 3.5 PTE types predicted PTSD with moderate accuracy. In conclusion, the dose-response theory was supported, with results indicating there may be a threshold count of lifetime PTE types (> 3) influencing traumatic stress outcomes.",72

Approximately 5 months later, children and parents (n = 178 dyads) completed standardized measures of posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms and parents reported on child overall recovery.Follow-up assessments found significant posttraumatic stress symptoms in 15% of children and 5% of parents, significant depression symptoms in 13% of children and 16% of parents, and problematic overall recovery in 17% of children. For both children and parents, posttraumatic stress and depression symptom severity were strongly associated. Child and parent symptoms were only modestly associated with each other, and there were few families in which both child and parent had significant posttraumatic stress or depression. Parent symptoms, but not child symptoms, were inversely associated with children's overall recovery.For about 1 in 6 children and parents, unintentional injury treated in the ED can be associated with negative psychological sequelae and suboptimal recovery. Within families, child and parent responses may differ; their relative association with overall recovery deserves additional research. To promote emotional recovery, ED clinicians should be aware of the potential psychological impact of unintentional injury, provide timely evidence-based anticipatory guidance, and communicate these concerns to primary care clinicians.",72

Specifically, the study tests the moderating roles of hurricane-related life-threatening events and loss/disruption on the relations between conduct problems and violence exposure, social support, parenting behaviors, and family routines, respectively. This study draws data from an existing dataset, comprised of 281 displaced mother-child dyads from New Orleans and 98 non-displaced mother-child dyads from Baton Rouge, a city approximately 85 miles west of New Orleans. It was predicted that heightened conduct problems would be associated with more prior violence exposure, less perceived social support, and parenting behaviors including more corporal punishment and inconsistent discipline, as well as fewer family routines. It was further predicted that level of hurricane exposure would moderate each of these relations. Results indicate that the level of hurricane exposure moderated the relation between conduct problems and violence exposure, as well as that between conduct problems and family routines. Implications are discussed.",73

This article provides a critical review of 72 research studies on traumatized parents with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the parent-child interaction, and the impact on their nonexposed child (0-18 years). The evidence suggests that traumatization can cause parenting limitations, and these limitations can disrupt the development of the young child. From the studies reviewed several patterns emerged: Relational patterns of traumatized parents who are observed to be emotionally less available and who perceive their children more negatively than parents without symptoms of PTSD; relational patterns of children who at a young age are easily deregulated or distressed and at an older age are reported to face more difficulties in their psychosocial development than children of parents without symptoms of PTSD; and relational patterns that show remarkable similarities to relational patterns between depressed or anxious parents and their children. Mechanisms such as mentalization, attachment, physiological factors, and the cycle of abuse offer a valuable perspective to further our understanding of the relational patterns. This article builds on previous work by discussing the emerged patterns between traumatized parents and their nonexposed children from a relational and transactional perspective.",73

There are currently limited treatment options for the clinical management of concussions. Resilience is a protective, modifiable psychological construct that has been shown to improve concussion-related sequelae. To date, however, no research has evaluated how resilience impacts sexuality outcomes after concussion in women. Aim Evaluate if resilience offers protection against negative sexuality outcomes in a cohort of reproductive, aged women with a concussion, seeking care in the Emergency Department of a Level-1 Trauma Center. We hypothesized that women with low resilience will be more likely to experience negative impacts on sexuality and that increasing levels of resilience will be associated with more positive sexuality outcomes. Methods Secondary data analyses. Measures Resilience was evaluated with the Resilience Scale (RS), and the Brain Injury Questionnaire for Sexuality (BIQS) was used for sexuality. Results Of the 299 participants recruited for the parent study, 80 with concussion had complete follow-up data and were included in these secondary analyses. Less than half (42.5%; n = 34) had low resilience (score≤130 on the RS), and the remaining 46 (57.5%) had high resilience (score&amp;gt;130 on the RS). In crude linear regression models, 1-unit increase in resilience was associated with a 4% increase in sexuality outcomes (β = 0.04, 95% CI:0.01, 0.05; P = .008). The effect estimate remained similar in post-concussion-symptom-adjusted models (β = 0.03, 95% CI:0.002, 0.06; P = .03). Mood-adjusted models showed a statistically significant interaction term (P &amp;lt; .0001). After stratifying by mood, findings showed that unit increases in resilience were associated with a 6% increase in sexuality outcomes for women in the high risk mood group (HADS score ≥11; PCS-adjusted β = 0.06, 95% CI:0.02, 0.11; P = .009). Conclusion Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate how these improvements in resilience translate to patient recovery measures following concussion.",73

This study identified the trajectories of K-12 education history among older adults in the Health and Retirement Study born between 1930 and 1960, and examined the associations with demographic variables. Drawing on 2017 Spring and Fall Life History Mail Survey (LHMS; n = 3,206), we used sequence analysis to determine and classify trajectories of school types across the education history. We identified five trajectories: 1) always private school with White students, 2) always public school with White students, 3) always public school with Non-White students, 4) mostly private school with Non-White students, and 5) no report of school types. The trajectories showed that changes in school type (i.e. private to public) often happened in grade 9. Changes rarely happened across race/ethnicity groups (i.e. mostly White to mostly non-White). We used multinomial logistic regression to examine the relationship between demographic variables and education trajectories. We found that compared to Black participants, White participants were significantly less likely to be in mostly Non-White schools (public and private schools, p&amp;lt;0.001). The 1940s and 1950s cohort were more likely to join mostly White private schools than the 1930s cohort (odds ratio: 1.70 for 1940s and 1.62 for 1950s separately, p&amp;lt;0.005). Our findings illustrate a novel application of sequence analysis with life history data, as well as new evidence on recial segregation in early-life education within the last century.",73

The sample comprised 200 Palestinian children recruited at primary schools in four refugee camps (Bureij, Gaza Beach Camp, Jabalia, and Rafah Camp) in the Gaza Strip in 2012. Of these children, 104 were boys (mean age 8·6 years [SD 2·3], range 6–11) and 96 girls (9·6 years [2·7], 6–11). The children were engaged in activities aimed at eliciting narratives of military violence and traumatic experiences, and individual, familial, and community-related resources that they had mobilised during the war to cope with traumas. Thematic content analysis was applied to written materials and narratives using Nvivo10 software. The main objective was to identify in detail the dimensions of wellbeing present in the narratives, and perceptions of risk and protective factors. The inter-rater agreement ranged from 74% to 95%.FindingsBoth boys (78%; 81 of 104) and girls (52%; 50 of 96) reported having directly experienced traumatic events related to war, episodes of political violence (39% of boys [41 of 104], 38% of girls [36 of 96]), domestic violence (31% of boys [32 of 104], 3% of girls [three of 96]), or community violence (6% of boys [six of 104], 2% of girls [two of 96]). Thematic content analysis led to the identification of ten main themes: relationship with peers, family, and other significant adults, affect balance, constraints on movement, play, health, school, personal satisfaction, and spirituality. In boys, the most severe self-reported risks were related to constraints on movement and affect balance, followed by relationship with family, and health. Play, personal resources, relationship with other significant adults, and school were perceived to be protective factors. The girls reported more sources of protection than risks, conversely, boys perceived themselves to be more at risk than protected.InterpretationChildren deal with ongoing suffering and discomfort by means of subjective and intersubjective agency in multiple domains of their life, showing psychological adaptability.FundingNone.",73

California Psychological Inventory (CPI) personality trait scores from prehire evaluations were compared with follow‐up CPI scores to test whether exposure to traumatic events was correlated with changes in traits from baseline to 5–10 years later. Measures of occupational TEs, PTS symptoms, and police work environment stress were administered. Mean trait scores declined on all CPI traits analyzed in the study. Trait change was evaluated using the Reliable Change Index; change in participants’ scores unlikely to occur by chance ranged from 11% to 63% in the traits examined. All participants reported substantial TE exposure. PTS symptoms were correlated with steeper decline in 4 of 5 traits, with effect sizes ranging from r = −.47 to r = −.67. Scores on measures of job‐related TEs were negatively correlated with only one CPI trait (empathy) at T2 ( r = −.31), and were unrelated to slope of trait change. Work environment stress was significantly related to gender, with female officers reporting higher levels of operational ( r = .45) and organizational ( r = .54) stress.",73
https://openalex.org/W4382814570,10.1093/jbcr/irad045.084,111 Predictors of Social Participation Outcomes at Two Years after Burn Injury,"Abstract Introduction People with burn injury often experience long-term social participation challenges. A previous study explored demographic and injury variables predicting social participation outcomes after burn injury. This study aims to further examine post-traumatic growth, and physical and psychological symptoms as predictors of social participation. Methods This is a multi-center Burn Model System (BMS) study with a prospective cohort design. Adult BMS Database participants from July 2018 to April 2022 were included. Predictors were measured at 12- and 24-month after injury including Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory Short Form (PTGI-SF), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29) Depression, Anxiety, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Pain Interference and Heat Intolerance. Social participation outcomes were measured with Life Impact Burn Recovery Evaluation (LIBRE) Social Interactions and Social Activities at 24-month after injury. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between predictors and outcomes. Results A total of 158 burn survivors were included with an average age of 47 years and a mean burn size of 19.5% total body surface area. Significant predictors included PCL-C and PROMIS-29 Depression for LIBRE Social Interactions, and Heat Intolerance, PROMIS-29 Pain Interference and Depression, and PCL-C for LIBRE Social Activities. See Table 1 for details of regression results. Conclusions Overall, self-reported post-traumatic stress and depression are associated with limited social interactions while heat intolerance, pain interference, depression, and post-traumatic stress are related to fewer social activities. Applicability of Research to Practice This study improves our understanding of the multiple and modifiable factors which influence social participation after burn injury.",73
https://openalex.org/W2803666529,10.1360/n972017-01194,The relationship between post-traumatic stress and depressive symptoms in children: A two-year longitudinal study,"Studies have shown that children and adolescents exposed to natural disasters could be at high risk of mental health problems. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is now well established as the most common psychopathological outcome of trauma. Studies have shown that PTSD often co-occurs with depression. The comorbidity of PTSD and depression adversely affects the hospitalization of patients. The high prevalence of PTSD and depression poses challenges for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the potential mechanism of the comorbidity of PTSD and depression deserves attention. Researchers have proposed several models of comorbidity, such as the “demoralization model,” which indicates that the initial PTSD symptoms may cause subsequent depression. Conversely, the “depressogenic effect model” suggests that the initial depression may cause the subsequent PTSD. However, the “synchronous change model” posits that PTSD and depression occur at the same time and are independent of each other. Clearly, a consistent conclusion has not been reached. Therefore, the relationship between PTSD and depression should be further explored. Moreover, there are some limitations in previous studies. For example, the majority of these studies have focused on PTSD symptoms as a whole, without distinguishing PTSD symptom clusters (such as re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal) with depression over time. In addition, the most recent studies focused on adults. Children and adolescents are in the developmental stage of cognitive nervous system and emotional regulation and lack the coping mechanism for adaptation and recovery from a disaster. Therefore, they may be vulnerable to environmental changes and negative life events. In view of this, the comorbidity of PTSD and depression needs to be explored in children. The present study investigates the relationship between depressive symptoms and PTSD and differences between the relationships of PTSD clusters and depression among children who survived the Zhouqu debris flow. PTSD was measured with the University of California at Los Angeles Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index for DSM-IV, and depressive symptoms were measured with the Children’s Depression Inventory. Participants were assessed at 3, 15, and 27 months after the Zhouqu debris flow. The sample consisted of 1070 adolescents (aged 13.90±1.33), among which 452 (42%) were male and 618 (58%) were female. A cross-lagged analysis revealed bidirectional associations between PTSD and depressive symptoms from T1 to T2, and only depressive symptoms predicted PTSD significantly from T2 to T3. The relationships between depressive symptoms and three PTSD clusters were also different. From T1 to T3, depressive symptoms predicted three PTSD clusters continuously. However, avoidance had no predictive effect on depression from T1 to T3, re-experiencing predicted depressive symptoms from T1 to T2, and hyperarousal demonstrated a continuous predictive effect on depression from T1 to T3. Our study suggested that the relationship between depressive symptoms and PTSD may change over time and the relationships between the three clusters of PTSD and depression may be different. Psychological therapy should focus on different symptoms based on the trauma stage. Future studies should compare the relationships between depressive symptoms and PTSD across different courses after trauma, trauma types, genders, and age stages.",73

The association between resilience and outcome from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is examined, and the reliability and validity of the Resilience Scale and its short form in mTBI research is evaluated. Patients with mTBI (n=74) and orthopedic controls (n=39) completed the Resilience Scale at one, six, and 12 months after injury. Additionally, self-reported post-concussion symptoms, fatigue, insomnia, pain, post-traumatic stress, and depression, as well as quality of life, were evaluated. The internal consistency of the Resilience Scale and the short form ranged from 0.91 to 0.93 for the mTBI group and from 0.86 to 0.95 for controls. The test–retest reliability ranged from 0.70 to 0.82. Patients with mTBI and moderate-to-high resilience reported significantly fewer post-concussion symptoms, less fatigue, insomnia, traumatic stress, and depressive symptoms, and better quality of life, than the patients with low resilience. No association between resilience and time to return to work was found. Resilience was associated with self-reported outcome from mTBI, and based on this preliminary study, can be reliably evaluated with Resilience Scale and its short form in those with mTBIs.",73
https://openalex.org/W2885922480,10.1093/schbul/sby115,Early-Stage Negative Symptom Trajectories and Relationships With 13-Year Outcomes in First-Episode Nonaffective Psychosis,"Negative symptoms are a key treatment target in early psychosis intervention. There is a paucity of research examining longitudinal course of negative symptoms across the initial years of treatment for first-episode psychosis using individual-based trajectory analysis. No study has been conducted investigating differential relationships of early-stage negative symptom trajectories with long-term distal outcomes. This study examined patterns and baseline predictors of negative symptom trajectories over the first 3 years of treatment in 138 patients aged 18–55 years presenting with first-episode nonaffective psychosis, using latent class growth analysis based on symptom ratings measured at 4 different time points (baseline, 1, 2, and 3 years). We further explored prospective relationships of identified trajectory classes with functional and negative symptom outcomes at 13-year follow-up. Our results revealed 3 distinct negative symptom trajectories including minimal-stable (59.6%), mild-stable (29.4%), and high-increasing (11.0%) trajectories. Poorer premorbid adjustment, more severe global cognitive impairment, and depressive symptoms at baseline were found to predict high-increasing trajectory. Among 3 trajectory classes, patients in high-increasing trajectory had the worst functional and negative symptom outcomes at 13-year follow-up, with post hoc analyses demonstrating significant outcome differences between high-increasing and minimal-stable trajectories. Our findings thus affirm a heterogeneous course of negative symptoms in first-episode psychosis and indicate that early-stage negative symptom trajectories are critically associated with long-term outcomes. Patients displaying persistently high negative symptom levels in the initial 3 years of treatment may represent a specific subgroup who necessitates an extended period of early intervention specifically targeting at negative symptoms to promote early functional recovery.",73

This study is the first to examine PTG in trauma narratives of survivors of the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks. Participants recalled their experiences 7 and 18 months post 9/11, and content analysis was conducted to detect PTG. Posttraumatic stress was also measured. PTG was commonly reported. Relating to others and positivity were frequent in the PTSD and non-PTSD group, although less frequent over time in the PTSD. Greater appreciation for life was reported by the non-PTSD group but relatively absent in the PTSD group. Women but not men reported relating to others across time. It appears that there are distinct profiles of growth implicated in distress and adaptation.",73

Interviews were conducted by field workers applying measures of traumatic events (TEs), ongoing adversity, a sense of injustice, PTS symptoms and psychological distress.Latent transition analysis supported a 3-class longitudinal model (psychological distress, comorbid symptoms and low symptoms). We derived 4 composite trajectories comprising recovery (20.8%), a persisting morbidity trajectory (7.2%), an incident trajectory (37.2%) and a low-symptom trajectory (34.7%). Compared with the low-symptom trajectory, the persistent and incident trajectories reported greater stress arising from poverty and family conflict, higher TE exposure for 2 historical periods, and a sense of injustice for 2 historical periods. The persistent trajectory was unique in reporting greater TE exposure in the Indonesian occupation, whereas the incident trajectory reported greater TE exposure during the later internal conflict that occurred between baseline and follow-up. Compared with the low-symptom trajectory, the incident trajectory reported a greater sense of injustice relating to the periods of the Indonesian occupation and independence. The persistent trajectory was characterised by a sense of injustice relating to the internal conflict and contemporary times. The recovery trajectory was characterised by the absence of these risk factors, the only difference from the low-symptom trajectory being that the former reported a sense of injustice for the period surrounding independence.Our findings suggest that the timing of both TE exposure and the focus of a sense of injustice may differentiate those with persisting and new-onset mental health morbidity in settings of recurrent conflict.",73

This study evaluated 126 California NG members, exploring the relationship between immediate postdeployment employment status and self-reported mental health symptoms, including evidence of alcohol misuse. Participants were recruited from a NG unit within the first 3 months after returning home in August 2011. Over one-third of participants reported being unemployed beyond the part-time NG commitment. Mental health symptoms were greater in those participants without civilian employment. Additionally, those participants with comorbid alcohol misuse with either depression or post-traumatic stress disorder were significantly more likely to lack civilian employment. Interaction testing revealed a significant interaction between employment status and alcohol misuse for both depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Alcohol use was concluded to moderate the relationship between civilian unemployment and mental health symptoms. Results suggest that the part-time employment provided through NG service may serve as a protective factor in the development of negative psychological outcomes, except for cases where alcohol misuse is present.",73

Although volunteers’ participation plays an important role in disaster preparedness, their actual participation in disaster preparedness activities is still low. To find ways to encourage more volunteers to participate, this study analyzed the social background and organizational and attitudinal factors affecting the volunteers’ willingness to participate. Questionnaires were distributed to 990 registered disaster volunteers across Beijing and the data were analyzed using linear regression models. Results revealed a weak willingness to participate in disaster preparedness. Only 28.08% of the respondents indicated that they were “very ready” to participate in voluntary disaster preparedness, and 14.65% showed “a little bit” of interest. The following was concluded: (1) Disaster volunteers’ social background variables were related to their willingness to participate in disaster preparedness. Compared to male volunteers, female volunteers were more willing to participate. Chinese Communist Party members were more willing to participate than non-members. (2) Providing accidental life insurance for the volunteers had a positive effect on their willingness to participate in disaster preparedness. Provision of more training had a negative effect on the volunteers’ willingness to participate, indicating a low quality of training. (3) Organizational identification was positively related to the volunteers’ willingness to participate. According to these results, we suggest that volunteer organizations should improve their standards and procedures for disaster volunteer recruitment and selection, and gain a deeper understanding of the needs of the disaster volunteers in order to better motivate them to participate.",73

We also explored the role of positive R/S coping in modifying each of these associations. After adjusting for a variety of covariates and prior values of the respective outcome assessed at baseline, the results indicated that R/S struggles were associated with a small increase in depression and perceived posttraumatic growth six months later. Positive R/S coping moderated the association between R/S struggles and perceived posttraumatic growth (but not depression), with R/S struggles yielding a stronger positive association with perceived posttraumatic growth at lower levels of positive R/S coping. We discuss some implications of our findings for supporting people who encounter R/S struggles in the aftermath of interpersonal transgressions.",73

Recent evidence suggests there is an association between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and increased opioid misuse, while little is known about opioid-related hospitalizations. This study used data from the World Trade Center Health Registry (WTCHR), a longitudinal cohort consisting of individuals directly exposed to the September 11th terrorist attacks with a high prevalence of resulting PTSD (3.8-29.6%). We linked WTCHR data to New York State hospitalization data to examine the question: do opioid-related hospitalizations (first time and repeated) differ by PTSD status. In a study sample of 37,968 adults, 145 experienced at least one episode of opioid-related hospitalization and 64 had repeated episodes during the study period. We found that in the 13-years post-9/11, individuals with PTSD had a significantly higher risk of a first-time opioid-related hospitalization (Hazard Ratio: 3.6, 95% CI: 2.7, 5.0) and repeated opioid-related hospitalizations (Hazard Ratio: 3.9, 95% CI: 2.7, 5.8) than those who did not have PTSD. Improved treatment of and increased screenings for PTSD may reduce the likelihood of opioid misuse in this population and consequently overdoses, hospitalizations, and healthcare costs.",73

We performed a meta-analysis that examined the associations between multiple risk factors and depressive symptoms after the 9/11 WTC terrorist attacks in New York City among civilians including survivors, residents, and passersby.PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were searched from September, 2001 through July, 2016. Reviewers identified eligible studies and synthesized odds ratios (ORs) using a random-effects model.The meta-analysis included findings from 7 studies (29,930 total subjects). After adjusting for multiple comparisons, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with minority race/ethnicity (OR, 1.40; 99.5% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.88), lower income level (OR, 1.25; 99.5% CI, 1.09 to 1.43), post-9/11 social isolation (OR, 1.68; 99.5% CI, 1.13 to 2.49), post-9/11 change in employment (OR, 2.06; 99.5% CI, 1.30 to 3.26), not being married post-9/11 (OR, 1.59; 99.5% CI, 1.18 to 2.15), and knowing someone injured or killed (OR, 2.02; 99.5% CI, 1.42 to 2.89). Depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with greater age (OR, 0.86; 99.5% CI, 0.70 to 1.05), no college degree (OR, 1.32; 99.5% CI, 0.96 to 1.83), female sex (OR, 1.24; 99.5% CI, 0.98 to 1.59), or direct exposure to WTC related traumatic events (OR, 1.26; 99.5% CI, 0.69 to 2.30).Findings from this study suggest that lack of post-disaster social capital was most strongly associated with depressive symptoms among the civilian population after the 9/11 WTC terrorist attacks, followed by bereavement and lower socioeconomic status. These risk factors should be identified among civilians in future disaster response efforts.",74

A large proportion of children showed good end-state functioning at follow-up (CBT: 65%; CT: 71%). Contrary to 6-month outcomes, maternal adjustment no longer moderated children's outcome, nor did any other tested variables.The findings confirm the positive longer-term outcomes of using trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral methods for PTSD secondary to single-incident trauma and that these outcomes are not dependent on the use of exposure.

In this study, we aimed to understand the patterns of PTSD symptom change in both PE and present-centered therapy (PCT). Methods Participants were active duty military personnel ( N = 326, 89.3% male, 61.2% white, 32.5 years old) randomized to spaced-PE (S-PE; 10 sessions over 8 weeks), PCT (10 sessions over 8 weeks), or massed-PE (M-PE; 10 sessions over 2 weeks). Using latent profile analysis, we determined the optimal number of PTSD symptom change classes over time and analyzed whether baseline and follow-up variables were associated with class membership. Results Five classes, namely rapid responder (7–17%), steep linear responder (14–22%), gradual responder (30–34%), non-responder (27–33%), and symptom exacerbation (7–13%) classes, characterized each treatment. No baseline clinical characteristics predicted class membership for S-PE and M-PE; in PCT, more negative baseline trauma cognitions predicted membership in the non-responder v. gradual responder class. Class membership was robustly associated with PTSD, trauma cognitions, and depression up to 6 months after treatment for both S-PE and M-PE but not for PCT. Conclusions Distinct profiles of treatment response emerged that were similar across interventions. By and large, no baseline variables predicted responder class. Responder status was a strong predictor of future symptom severity for PE, whereas response to PCT was not as strongly associated with future symptoms.",74

However, the long-term toll of war captivity on the secondary traumatization (ST) of adult offspring remains unknown. This study aimed to assess the longitudinal associations between former prisoners of war (ex-POWs), PTSD, depressive symptoms and their adult offsprings ST.A sample of 134 Israeli father-child dyads (80 ex-POWs dyads and a comparison group of 44 veterans'dyads) completed self-report measures. The fathers participated in three waves of measurements following the Yom Kippur War (T1: 1991, T2: 2003, and T3: 2008), while the offspring took part in T4 (2013).Offspring of ex-POWs with PTSD at T3 reported more ST symptoms than offspring of ex-POWs without PTSD and controls. Ex-POWs' PTSD hyper-arousal symptom cluster at T3 was positively related to offsprings ST avoidance symptom cluster. Offspring of ex-POWs with chronic and delayed PTSD trajectories reported more ST symptoms than offspring of ex-POWS and controls with resilient trajectories. Ex-POWs' PTSD and depression symptoms at T1, T2 and T3 mediated the link between war captivity (groups) and offsprings ST in T4.The use of self-report measures that did not cover the entire span of 40 years since the war, might may bias the results.The intergenerational transmission of captivity related trauma following the Yom Kippur War was exemplified. ST symptoms among ex-POWs' adult offspring are closely related to their father' PTSD and related depressive symptom comorbidity.",74

Few studies have investigated the burden of somatic symptoms on attack victims, or the association of such symptoms with exposure to the 9/11 attacks. World Trade Center Health Registry (Registry) enrollees who were present south of Chambers Street during or immediately after the 9/11 attacks and who provided consistent answers regarding injury sustained on 9/11 were followed prospectively for up to 16 years post-9/11/01. We employed linear regression to evaluate the associations between injury severity, psychological distress and somatic symptoms in 2322 persons who completed all four Registry surveys and a subsequent Health and Quality of Life survey. Twenty-one percent of subjects had a “very high” burden of somatic symptoms, greater than in populations not exposed to a disaster. Somatic symptoms exhibited a dose-response association separately with injury severity and psychological distress trajectories. Victims of the 9/11 attacks suffer from a substantial burden of somatic symptoms which are associated with physical and psychological consequences of exposure to the attacks.

The current study investigated how PTG may be attributed to experiences of a multitude of highly stressful life events, and how PTG is correlated with PTSD symptoms, the severity of the event, and the total number of childhood traumas experienced.Adolescents (N = 139) participated in a survey that assessed six major life events of childhood trauma and rated the severity of each event, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and PTG.The majority of adolescents attributed their PTG experiences to one event, despite experiencing multiple traumas. However, experiencing more events was associated with greater PTSS and some forms of PTG such as changed priorities, increased self-reliance, and establishing a new path in life. Results from regression analyses also showed that trauma severity and PTSS were linearly correlated with PTG, and thus, a curvilinear relationship was not identified.Cumulative traumatic events may lead to increases in a sense of personal growth, while also increasing distress, in nonclinical adolescents.

https://openalex.org/W2412304071,,PREDICTORS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER IN MILITARY PERSONNEL DEPLOYED TO PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS.,"As the empirical evidence suggests PTSD, depression and anxiety represent prevalent and severe problem in armed forces. High co morbidity of these disorders with each other further complicates clinical picture. Georgian military personnel regularly take part in different peacekeeping missions, however there is no existing data regarding associations of mental health problems in Georgian armed forces. Data was collected between 2014 and 2015, after 6 month deployment. Participants were 2810 Georgian military personnel who took part in peacekeeping missions. All participants were male, average age: M=31,2 (SD=6,3). All instruments used in the study were self-report scales. PTSD was measured by PCL-5; Depression and anxiety was measured by PHQ (Patient Health Questionnaire). Both variables - Severity of Anxiety symptoms and severity of depression symptoms independently predicted PTSD, but after being placed together in the same regression model, only depression symptom severity accounted for significant portion of variance. Due to the fact that the participants of our study (n=69) were young (M=29,68 ; SD=5,8) male personnel, our findings cannot be generalized. Also it should be considered, that for PTSD screening we used self-report questionnaires, which reduces liability of participants' answers and increases the tendency of self-biased responses. It is advisable for clinical practitioners and therapists to consider depression symptoms in patients with PTSD and screen for depression additionally, in order to exclude or include co morbidity factors in treatment course.",74

Changes in the connectivity strength of these networks upon acute stress may predict vulnerability to long-term stress effects, which can only be tested in prospective longitudinal studies. Using such longitudinal design, we investigated whether the magnitude of acute-stress-induced functional connectivity changes (delta-FC) predicts the development of post-traumatic stress-disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a relatively resilient group of young police students that are known to be at high risk for trauma exposure. Using resting-state fMRI, we measured acute-stress-induced delta-FC in 190 police recruits before (baseline) and after trauma exposure during repeated emergency-aid services (16-month follow-up). Delta-FC was then linked to the changes in perceived stress levels (PSS) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PCL and CAPS). Weakened connectivity between the SN and DMN core regions upon acute-stress induction at baseline predicted longitudinal increases in perceived-stress level but not of post-traumatic stress symptoms, whereas increased coupling between the overall SN and anterior cerebellum was observed in participants with higher clinician-rated PTSD symptoms, particularly intrusion levels. All the effects remained significant when controlling for trauma-exposure levels and cortisol-stress reactivity. Neither hormonal nor subjective measures exerted similar predictive or acquired effects. The reconfiguration of large-scale neural networks upon acute-stress induction is relevant for assessing and detecting risk and resilience factors for PTSD. This study highlights the SN connectivity-changes as a potential marker for trauma-related symptom development, which is sensitive even in a relatively resilient sample.",74

Methods The Impact of Event Scale‐Revised ( IES‐R ) was used to assess post‐traumatic stress symptoms in 612 patients with schizophrenic ( ICD ‐10 F2 ; n = 163), mood ( F3 ; n = 299), or neurotic disorders ( F4 ; n = 150) at 1–4 months and again at 13–16 months after the disaster (retention rate: 68%). Results The mean IES‐R total score for all diagnostic groups was 18.6 at index and 13.4 at follow up. The mean IES‐R total score for patients with neurotic disorders (22.5) was significantly higher than that of patients with mood disorders (18.1) and schizophrenic disorders (15.9). At follow up, these scores decreased for all groups and inter‐group differences were not observed. Conclusions Vulnerability to traumatic stress after a disaster was most severe in patients with neurotic disorders, followed by mood disorders, and, lastly, schizophrenic disorders. This difference among the three diagnostic groups was not found 1 year after the disaster.",74

This study utilizes qualitative data collection and analysis methods, mainly conducting semi-structured interviews and thematic analyses of interview content. The study sample consists of ten adolescent ex-detainees and uses purposeful selection to ensure the inclusion of ex-detainees from the southern areas of the West Bank (Bethlehem and Hebron), aged between seventeen to nineteen. The findings indicate that resilience is based on a high tolerance of stress resulting from traumatic events, such as arrest, and the ability to control life events, along with the reinforcement of a positive attitude toward social and political experiences, and the capacity to transform stress into an opportunity instead of a debilitating threat. The results also show that resilience is correlated with various factors, including secure attachment, supportive relationships, social support systems, conflict relationships – personal and collective aggression, challenge, commitment to principles (i.e. nationalism) and post hoc engagement in public events (community and voluntary work, solidarity visits with families of ex-detainees, participation in public discourse).",74

https://openalex.org/W2775830219,10.31390/gradschool_theses.393,Predictors of positive adjustment in children exposed to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Hurricane Katrina,"Although numerous studies have focused on the harmful effects of natural disasters, few have examined the positive adjustment that is demonstrated by some individuals post-disaster. Even fewer studies have investigated this resiliency in children. The current study aims to address this limitation by evaluating variables related to children’s resiliency post-disaster. Specifically, the study was designed to identify and compare predictors of positive adjustment in youth who were exposed to either Hurricane Katrina or the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. It was hypothesized that children who use more adaptive coping strategies and have higher levels of social support will show greater amounts of positive adjustment after a disaster. This hypothesis was partially supported in both samples. For children exposed to Hurricane Katrina, those who reported higher levels of classmate/peer, and teacher support also reported higher levels of personal adjustment. For oil spill exposed children, the use of destructive coping strategies resulted in lower levels of positive adjustment. Social support provided from parents and peers both emerged as significant predictors of positive adjustment in this sample. Determining the degree to which variables such as social support and coping predict positive adjustment allows for the identification of risk and protective factors in children exposed to natural or man-made disasters. The results of this study will also provide useful information to professionals working with trauma-exposed children.",75

How they cope with these events is an important part of their overall well‐being and resilience. This longitudinal study on coping in a sample of National Guard couples examined the association between the predeployment coping (active vs. avoidant) of each in the relationship, and their own and their significant others’ mental health (anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) and family well‐being (dyadic adjustment and parenting stress) postdeployment. Method A total of 238 matched couples completed the predeployment survey, 143 matched couples completed the post, with 122 matched couples completing both pre‐ and postdeployment surveys. Results While active coping was not significantly associated with any outcomes, predeployment avoidant coping in both soldiers and significant others was associated with increased anxiety, PTSD, and depression post deployment (actor effects). Additionally, soldier avoidant coping predeployment was associated with increased parenting stress for soldiers, while significant other avoidant coping predeployment was associated with increased relationship distress for significant others (actor effects). Finally, significant other avoidant coping predeployment was associated with higher parenting distress for soldiers postdeployment (partner effect). Conclusion Findings suggest that interventions are needed to combat avoidant coping (behavioral disengagement, denial, substance abuse) predeployment because this way of coping is strongly related to negative outcomes. In addition, those who work clinically with these families should work to reduce avoidant coping strategies and any familial dynamics exacerbated by this way of coping.",75

The current study addresses this issue among a civilian population. Two hundred trauma-exposed parents, mean age of 37.2, 62% mothers, were assessed using self-report questionnaires, for background variables, PTSD symptoms using the PDS, depression symptoms (BDI), marital satisfaction (DAS-7), parenting behavior (APQ-9) and parenting satisfaction (Parenting Satisfaction Questionnaire). We hypothesized that positive parenting behavior and parenting satisfaction would be negatively correlated with PTSD symptom levels, and that this relationship would be mediated by marital satisfaction; the independent effects of depression on marital and parenting functioning were also examined. Data was analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results indicated that PTSD was related to poorer parenting behavior (B= .089, p=.033), depression had a negative impact on parenting satisfaction (B= .983, p=.003) and marital satisfaction (B=-.672, p=.004), and marital satisfaction fully mediated the relationship between depression and parenting. The findings demonstrated that the effects of PTSD can cast a pall not only over the individual but over the entire family. Interventions are needed to address these issues.",75

Data were collected at brain injury clinics at 8–10 weeks and one-year after injury. Functional recovery at one year was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE).Results: A follow-up rate of 92% was achieved. The most common aetiologies of mTBI were falls (n = 222) and road traffic collisions (n = 154). Distribution of GCS was 15 (n = 363), 14 (n = 156) and 13 (n = 77). Ordinal regression analysis found that psychiatric history (p < .001), alcohol intoxication (p = .011), assault (p = .022) and GCS < 15 (p =< 0.001), were associated with worse outcome. An abnormal CT scan was not a predictor of disability.Conclusion: Patients with a previous psychiatric history, GCS < 15, etiology of assault, and alcohol intoxication result in worse long-term outcomes after mTBI. The predictors identified should be implemented when developing a future-validated a prognostic model for mTBI recovery.",75

This results in considerable information loss as repeatedly or continuously sampled data are aggregated into single summary measures. We describe a method for real-time multivariate outcome prediction that accommodates both longitudinal data and time-invariant clinical characteristics.We included comatose patients treated after resuscitation from cardiac arrest who underwent ≥6 h of electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. We used Persyst v13 (Persyst Development Corp, Prescott AZ) to generate quantitative EEG (qEEG) features and calculated hourly summaries of whole brain suppression ratio and amplitude-integrated EEG. We randomly selected half of subjects as a training sample and used the other half as a test sample. We applied group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) to the training sample to group patients based on qEEG evolution, then estimated the relationship of group membership and clinical covariates with awakening from coma and surviving to hospital discharge using logistic regression. We used these parameters to calculate posterior probabilities of group membership (PPGMs) in the test sample, and built three prognostic models: adjusted logistic regression (no GBTM), unadjusted GBTM (no clinical covariates) and adjusted GBTM (all data). We compared these models performance characteristics.We included 723 patients. Group-specific outcome estimates from a 7-group GBTM ranged from 0 to 75%. Compared to unadjusted GBTM, adjusted GBTM calibration was significantly improved at 6 and 12 h, and time to an outcome estimate <10% and <5% were significantly shortened. Compared to simple logistic regression, adjusted GBTM identified a substantially larger proportion of subjects with outcome probability <1%.We describe a novel methodology for combining GBTM output and clinical covariates to estimate patient-specific prognosis over time. Refinement of such methods should form the basis for new avenues of prognostication research that minimize loss of clinically important information.",75

Second, we examine the role of resilience characteristics of commitment, control and challenge in protecting children’s mental health from negative trauma impacts.
Methods: The participants were 386 Palestinian children and adolescents from Gaza (age 13.41+2.96, 52.07% boys and 47.93% girls). The results revealed a 25% prevalence of resilient children, and resilience was more common in well-educated families and children from geographical areas exposed to heavily Israeli shelling and destruction. Children were interviewed by sociodemographic scale, Gaza Traumatic Events Checklist, Child Depression and Anxiety Scale, UCLA PTSD Index for DSM-IV-Adolescent Version, and Resilience Attitude Scale.
Results: There were generally no gender differences in the exposure to traumatic events, as all. Neither were there gender differences in the mean number of traumatic events related to Israeli military violence or Palestinian factional fighting. According to the DSM-IV criterion, 12.4% of the children and adolescents reported probable PTSD, and 22.37% filled the two criteria partial PTSD, and 26.7% the one criteria partial PTSD (re-experiencing or avoidance or hyper arousal). More than a third (38.4% of the children did not have PTSD. There were no significant differences between boys and girls in PTSD. For depression and anxiety, boys and girls did not differ in the levels of PTSD, depressive and anxiety symptoms. Also only one marginal gender difference was found concerning resilience characteristics: girls reported more feelings of control than boys. The results revealed that 25.0% of the participants was classified as resilient indicating presence of high exposure to traumatic events and absence of PTSD and 22.2% as traumatized, i.e., presence of both high exposure to trauma and occurrence of PTSD. Of the children 12.7% were classified as vulnerable, and 40.1% were spared of both high trauma and PTSD. As hypothesized, resilience characteristics protected children’s mental health from trauma, e.g., military trauma was less associated with PTSD and anxiety among children showing high commitment. Discussion focuses on specific functions of resilience in the context of different kind of traumatic events of war, political and military violence.",75

The acute stress response may lead to pain sensitization and widespread pain, thereby compromising recovery. To our knowledge, no longitudinal study has assessed the associations between early PTSS and pain sensitization over time using quantitative sensory testing (QST). The aim of this study was to compare participants with different levels of PTSS, as measured by the impact of event scale (IES; subclinical 0-8, mild 9-25, and clinical ≥ 26) at baseline (<10-day post-injury) and at a follow-up of 1, 3, 6, and 12-month post-injury on pain sensitivity, neck mobility, pain distribution, and pain intensity. In total, 740 participants were recruited from emergency units or general practitioners with acute neck pain after a whiplash injury. The clinical PTSS group showed increased pain sensitivity on all QSTs at all time points compared to the subclinical PTSS group. Also, the clinical PTSS group showed significantly lower neck mobility at all time points except for a 3-month follow-up compared to the subclinical PTSS group. Moreover, the clinical PTSS group showed more widespread pain and self-reported headache and neck pain intensity at all time points compared to the subclinical PTSS group. This study emphasizes that participants with clinical levels of PTSS constitute a high-risk group that is sensitized to pain early after the injury. Hence, screening for PTSS within the 1st week after whiplash injury for those who experience high levels of pain intensity and distress may be an important clinical procedure in the assessment and treatment of whiplash-associated disorders (WAD).",75

The present systematic review evaluates the extant literature on PTSD in police officers using an international dataset. Methods We employed best‐evidence narrative synthesis to evaluate whether PTSD prevalence in police is elevated in comparison to the general population of Canada (8%), which itself has a higher lifetime PTSD prevalence than many other regions and thus serves as a conservative standard of comparison. Results PTSD prevalence in police varied considerably across studies from 0% ‐ 44% (M = 14.87%, Median = 9.2%). Despite this variability, strong evidence exists to suggest PTSD prevalence is elevated in police officers. Examination of possible sources of variability in prevalence outcomes highlighted substantial variability in outcomes due to the selection of measurement tool for assessing PTSD (e.g., DSM vs. IES). Examination of commonly‐assessed predictive factors for PTSD risk across the literature showed that individual‐difference factors (e.g., age, years of service) bear weak‐to‐nonexistent relationships with PTSD risk, while incident‐specific factors (e.g., severity of exposure) are more strongly and consistently associated with PTSD prevalence. Organizational factors (e.g., low support from supervisor) are at present understudied but important possible contributors to PTSD risk. Conclusions PTSD prevalence is elevated in police officers and appears most strongly related to workplace exposure. Measurement variability remains a critical source of inconsistencies across the literature with drastic implications for accurate detection of officers in need of mental health intervention.",75

However, symptoms of PTSD such as loss of concentration, re-experiencing, avoidance and numbing commonly presented to the medical staffs even two years after 30th September of 2009 which was the worst earthquakes in Indonesia. The present study aimed to assess the relationship between individual characteristics, family status and cognitive factors (coping strategies and self-efficacy) with PTSD among adolescents in earthquake prone areas. Padang, West Sumatera was chosen after the occurrence of the earthquake on 30th September 2009. A cross sectional study was conducted on randomly selected 600 adolescents using revised University of California, Los Angeles Reaction Index (UCLA-RI) questionnaire to measure PTSD, levels of trauma and coping strategies.

The auditory disorder is a leading service-connected disability among veterans and is highly comorbidly diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The biopsychosocial model illustrates that chronic health conditions are exacerbated or maintained by psychiatric distress. Therefore, alleviation of such psychiatric distress can have beneficial impacts on health conditions, such as tinnitus. The aim of this study was to determine whether individuals with both disorders who receive evidence-based therapy for PTSD, will experience decreases in both PTSD and tinnitus-related distress.Methods: Veterans with comorbid bothersome tinnitus and PTSD received Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and were assessed for PTSD, tinnitus-related distress, and depression at baseline and one month post-treatment follow-up.Results: At post-treatment follow-up, participants demonstrated significant decreases in PTSD symptoms compared to their baseline scores. Participants also demonstrated decreased tinnitus-related distress and depression, with high effect sizes.Discussion: This pilot study demonstrated the benefit of addressing psychiatric distress, such as PTSD, to simultaneously target bothersome tinnitus. Although not statistically significant due to the small sample size, large effect sizes indicate that tinnitus-related distress decreased as a function of receiving evidence-based therapy for PTSD.

We invited children (≤17 years old), who sustained a burn requiring surgical treatment or admission at one of the Dutch burn centers in 2013 (n = 175). As well as children who sustained a severe burn, covering >10% of the total body surface area (TBSA), throughout 2009-2018 (n = 228). Data was collected from a survey on health-related topics, Youth Health Care records, and the Dutch Burn Repository R3. For all participants, height and weight were converted to Z-scores using Dutch reference values. Linear mixed modeling, nested on the individual level, was used to examine the associations between burns and children's height and weight Z-scores. Children's height and weight Z-scores remained within the normal range throughout the study period. During the first-year postburn, children's height and weight Z-scores decreased by -0.21 (95% CI -0.41, -0.01) and -0.23 (95% CI -0.46, -0.04), respectively. Beyond the first-year postburn, estimates were consistent with a positive linear association between burn size and the overall effect of burns on participants' height and weight Z-scores. This included a modest, but statistically significant, effect among participants with a burn covering ≤4.5% and >14.0% of the TBSA. Sensitivity analyses did not alter our findings.

Refugees/asylum seekers have elevated risk for psychopathology with the most important being post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Subjective experiences and symptoms of the hosting populations which have also experienced similar traumas have received relatively little attention up to now. We aimed to evaluate the effects of Syrian Civil War in terms of psychopathology, traumatic experiences and PTSD on Turkish primary school students living in Suruç which is on the border with Syria and hosts a large population of asylum seekers.Methods: Two randomly selected schools operating in the district were included in the study. Sociodemographic Data forms, Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), Children’s Post-traumatic Reaction Index (CPRI) were used for evaluations. Data were analysed with SPSS 23.0. P was set at 0.05 (two-tailed).Results: Most common traumatic experiences via parental report were witnessing explosions (26.9%), witnessing injuries of extended family/relatives (21.8%) and witnessing deaths of acquaintances (17.9%). Lifetime traumatic events and lifetime self-injurious behaviour in children via parental report were 26.9% and 19.9%; respectively.

Background and aims: The world loses approximately one million people to suicide every year, leaving behind many suicide-loss survivors, family members and friends, who are significantly affected by the traumatic loss. Yet some suicide-loss survivors not only manage to cope with the loss, but actually experience posttraumatic growth (PTG). To date, no studies have fully examined the psychological processes that underlie this personal positive change. We hypothesized that attachment style would predict PTG and this association would be mediated by self-disclosure and social support. Method: A community sample of 131 suicide-loss survivors (108 women), aged 18–70, self-reported on attachment style, self-disclosure, social support, and PTG. Results: Securely attached individuals scored highest on PTG compared with other attachment styles. A structural equation model confirmed that self-disclosure and social support mediated the association between attachment and PTG. Suicide-loss survivors with secure attachment tended to self-disclose more and to perceive greater support from others than did suicide-loss survivors with insecure attachment, thus enhancing their chances of PTG. Limitations: The sample comprised mostly female participants, and the findings may not be directly generalizable to male suicide-loss survivors. Conclusion: Our results suggest that different psychological interventions should be utilized for suicide-loss survivors with particular attachment styles. Psychotherapies aiming to modify internal working models may be useful for enhancing PTG among survivors characterized by insecure attachment styles.",76

The relative prevalence and incidence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and PTSD were examined after the 9/11 attacks relative to trauma exposures.This study used full diagnostic assessment methods and careful categorization of exposure groups based on DSM-IV-TR criteria for PTSD to examine 373 employees of 9/11-affected New York City workplaces.Postdisaster new MDD episode (26%) in the entire sample was significantly more prevalent (p<.001) than 9/11-related PTSD (14%). Limiting the comparison to participants with 9/11 trauma exposures, the prevalence of postdisaster new MDD episode and 9/11-related PTSD did not differ (p=.446). The only 9/11 trauma exposure group with a significant difference in relative prevalence of MDD and PTSD were those with a 9/11 trauma-exposed close associate, for whom postdisaster new MDD episode (45%) was more prevalent (p=.046) than 9/11-related PTSD (31%).Because of the conditional definition of PTSD requiring trauma exposure that is not part of MDD criteria, prevalence comparisons of these two disorders must be limited to groups with qualifying trauma exposures to be meaningful. Findings from this study suggest distinct mechanisms underlying these two disorders that differentially relate to direct exposure to trauma vs. the magnitude of the disaster and personal connectedness to disaster and community-wide effects.",76

This review aims to identify the demographic, medical, and psychosocial correlates of perceived post‐traumatic growth in individuals of any age who were affected by paediatric cancer. Findings will highlight protective factors that may facilitate post‐traumatic growth, allowing for directed social support, intervention, and follow‐up care. Methods A systematic search based on the key concepts “post‐traumatic growth,” “neoplasms,” and “paediatric” retrieved 905 records from online databases: Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PILOTS: Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Eligible studies were appraised as excellent quality with a high level of interrater reliability. The results of 18 studies were synthesised. Results After the removal of outliers, post‐traumatic growth shared small, negative associations with time since diagnosis ( r = −0.14) and time since treatment completion ( r = −0.19), and small, positive associations with age at diagnosis ( r = 0.20), age at survey ( r = 0.17), post‐traumatic stress symptoms ( r = 0.11), and social support ( r = 0.25). Post‐traumatic growth was positively and moderately associated with optimism ( r = 0.31). Conclusions S everal findings were consistent with a comparable meta‐analysis in adult oncology populations. Targeted social support, clinical intervention, and education may facilitate post‐traumatic growth. Longitudinal research in individuals affected by childhood and adolescent cancer would allow an examination of the effects of predictive variables on post‐traumatic growth over time.",76

We hypothesized that parenting stress and maternal emotional availability would exhibit indirect effects on relationships between maternal PTSD and children's functioning. Method Participants were 52 trauma‐exposed mothers and their children (aged 7–12 years). Mothers completed measures of PTSD and parenting stress and reported on their children's functioning. Emotional availability was assessed through observer‐rated mother–child interactions. Results Emotional availability was not related to PTSD or child outcomes. Parenting stress had a substantial indirect effect on the relationships between maternal PTSD and child emotion regulation, internalizing, and externalizing behaviors. Conclusions Results highlight the need to target parenting stress in interventions with trauma‐exposed families.",76

Early identification of depression, anxiety and stress following injury, and subsequent preventive intervention, may reduce the long-term symptoms and negative impacts associated with depression and anxiety. The purpose of the study was to determine the incidence, severity and predictors of depression, anxiety and stress in injured patients in the acute phase of care, and at six months following injury, as well as the effectiveness of an in-hospital screening tool.This descriptive longitudinal study of trauma patients was conducted at a Level 1 Metropolitan Trauma Centre in Australia over 14 months. Participants were interviewed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale short-form version (DASS-21) during hospital admission then at 3 and 6 months after injury. Descriptive statistics were performed to evaluate participant characteristics and incidence of depression, anxiety and stress. Correlations and logistic regression were conducted to investigate the ability of the DASS-21 to predict symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress and to investigate factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress 6 months after injury.201 participants ranging in age (18-94 years) and injury severity participated in the baseline interview and 109 completed all 3 interviews over 6 months. Over half (54%) reported above normal scores for depression, anxiety and/or stress in at least one of the 3 time points. Intensive care unit admission and high levels of depression, anxiety and stress at 3 months post injury were predictors for high levels of depression, anxiety and stress at 6 months. Low scores for depression, anxiety and stress during admission were correlated with low scores for depression, anxiety and stress at 3 and 6 months.Depression, anxiety and stress in patients hospitalised following injury is common and should be anticipated in patients who have had an intensive care admission.

Although post-deployment or post-incident psychosocial support interventions are widely implemented within these services, its effectiveness in preventing the development of mental disorders is unclear.To systematically assess which, if any, post-deployment or post-incident psychosocial interventions are effective at preventing the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and common mental disorders (CMD) amongst military and emergency service worker (ESW) settings.A systematic review was conducted by searching four databases for any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled trials of post-deployment or post-incident interventions. The primary outcomes assessed were differences in symptoms of PTSD and CMD. Study quality was examined using the Downs and Black checklist. Pooled effect sizes and 95% CI were calculated using random-effects modelling for main meta-analyses, planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses.From 317 articles, seven RCTs were included in the final meta-analysis. Interventions identified included psychological debriefing, screening, stress education, team-based skills training and a peer-delivered risk assessment. A very small but significant effect was found for team-based skills training in reducing CMD symptoms. Some evidence was also found for team cohesion training in reducing both PTSD and CMD.Limited evidence was found for post-deployment or post-incident psychosocial interventions within military and ESW populations. More high-quality studies, particularly among ESW settings, are urgently needed to determine how to better prevent the development of trauma related disorders after exposure.",77

The primary outcome measure was activities and participation measured with the Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation - CASP and completed by children (N = 156) and caregivers (N = 231) six months post-mTBI. The CASP items were categorized into home, community, school, and environment. Predictors were categorized according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth. Predictors included pre-injury personal- and environmental factors, injury-related factors, symptoms, and resumption of activities in the first two weeks after mTBI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the predictive value of these factors.Results show that predictors differ across settings and perspectives (child or caregiver). Decreased activities and participation in children with mTBI can be predicted by adverse pre-injury behavioral functioning of the child (p < .000 - p = .038), adverse pre-injury family functioning (p = .001), lower parental SES (p = .038), more stress symptoms post-injury (p = .017 - p = .032), more post-concussive symptoms (p = .016 - p = .028) and less resumption of activities (p = .006 - p = .045).Pre-injury factors, more symptoms post-injury and less resumption of activities should be considered when children are screened for unfavorable outcomes. Additional factors may add to the prediction, but injury-related factors do not. It is recommended that future research explores psychosocial factors, such as coping styles, emotion-regulation, personality traits, social support, and other comorbid problems of both children and caregivers.",77

Demographic data, military‐specific data, responses on predeployment mental health assessments, and presence of previous treatment for psychiatric conditions were entered into a logistic regression based on expert determination, distinguishing the 2,133 behavioral health evacuations from those deployments that either did not end in evacuation or included evacuations for reasons other than behavioral health. The model, derived from a random half of the sample (training set), was verified on the other half (validation set). Predictor variables used in the model were calendar year; gender; age; rank; marital status; parental status; number of prior war zone deployments; branch of service; screens for symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and hazardous alcohol use on the predeployment mental health assessment; and prior substance‐ and non–substance‐related behavioral health diagnoses. Odds ratios (range: 1.05–3.85) for selected variables that contributed to the model were used to assign risk scores in the Behavioral Health Evacuation Risk Tool, which can aid predicting which service members are more likely to be evacuated from combat for behavioral health reasons, thus indicating where resources can be allocated for behavioral health referrals and war zone care.",77

We aimed to 1) explore heterogeneity patterns of co-occurrence between depression symptoms and resilience among children and adolescents exposed to an earthquake and 2) assess covariates (trauma exposure, sex, age, ethnicity, and sleep quality) in identifying the best fitting solution. Methods Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to examine patterns of self-reported depression and resilience in an epidemiological sample of 2,887 Chinese youth survivors 1 year after the Lushan earthquake. Results A suitable 3-class model were identified, which are mild depression/high resilience (65.0%), severe depression/high resilience (22.1%), and severe depression/low resilience (12.9%). Trauma exposure, demographic characteristics and sleep state can be used to identify the different latent classes.

For a systematic literature review, research studies selection and evaluation were done with respect to the posttraumatic stress disorder, earthquake disaster and associated risk factors. Studies were searched out with the help of MEDLINE, PUBMED, BMC, ELSEVIER, WILEY, JAP, and Google Scholar. Findings showed that the major risk factors associated for the development of PTSD in people who confronted earthquake disaster were gender (female), age, previous histories of psychiatric problems, loss of beloved one, substance abuse, disabilities, comorbidity, prior experiences of traumatic events, poverty, and lack of intervention programs for affected people. The major psychological problem which developed aftermath of an earthquake disaster was PTSD. PTSD persisted for a longer period if it was left untreated after an event. There were several risk factors which were responsible for the development of PTSD but the major factor that increased the probability of getting PTSD was comorbidity. Through proper intervention programs and on time diagnosis can minimize the chances of getting PTSD among earthquake survivors.",77

Characteristics of men and women were compared and factors associated with PTSD symptom severity were examined using the PTSD Checklist (PCL). Compared with men ( n = 1,015, 57.8%), women ( n = 740, 42.2%) were younger and of lower socioeconomic status. Ten to eleven years after September 11, 2001, 13.7% of men and 24.1% of women met criteria for PTSD. Results indicated that when considered with all other variables (i.e., demographic, socioeconomic and social resources, exposure to the attacks, life events), gender was not a significant predictor of PTSD symptom severity. Being younger on September 11, 2001, unemployed, less educated, and/or having higher exposure to the attacks, unmet mental health care needs, and less social support predicted higher PCL scores for both genders (βs = .077 to .239). Demographic characteristics and socioeconomic resources (Δ R 2 = .113) accounted for the largest amount of variance in PCL scores over and above exposure/evacuation, mental healthcare needs, and social support variables (Δ R 2 = .093 to .102). When trends of unmet mental healthcare needs were analyzed, the most prevalent response for men was that they preferred to manage their own symptoms (15.1%), whereas the most prevalent response for women was that they could not afford to pay for mental health care (14.7%). Although the prevalence of probable PTSD in women tower survivors was approximately twice as high as it was for men, this is attributable largely to demographic and socioeconomic resource factors and not gender alone. Implications for treatment and interventions are discussed.",77

The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between pre-arrival expectations and the course of psychological symptoms across time. A secondary analysis of 1,496 principal visa applicants across five waves of the Building a New Life in Australia (BNLA) study was conducted. The cross-sectional associations between expectations on the one hand, and post-traumatic stress (PTSD-8) symptoms and psychological distress (Kessler-6; K6) on the other, were assessed using multiple regression. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to identify discrete symptom trajectories of psychological symptoms across five years following settlement, and multinomial regressions were used to determine if violated expectations predicted membership of identified PTSD-8 and K6 class trajectories. LCGA supported a four-class solution for the PTSD-8 ""Resilient Post Traumatic Stress (PTS)"" (54.1%), ""Improving PTS"" (15.0%), ""Deteriorating PTS"" (17.3%), and ""Persistently High PTS"" (13.6%). For the K6, three classes were identified: ""Persistently Mild K6"" (60.4%), ""Resilient K6"" (9.4%), and ""Persistently High K6"" (30.2%). Thwarted expectations were found to significantly predict membership of less favourable symptom trajectories classes in the context of other established predictors. Post-settlement expectations may thus have weak but unique predictive value for the course of psychological symptoms alongside other factors such as older age and financial stress. Implications of these findings for service provision and policy are discussed.",77

Available information is limited by insufficient follow-up and lack of longitudinal studies. Baseline factors (e.g., sex; obesity) have been related to PTSD, but post-hospitalization factors have not been studied. Objective: This study aimed to analyse prevalence, baseline, post-discharge factors and possible clinical courses of PTSD after hospitalization for COVID-19. Method: 109 patients (94.7% of the original sample) completed a programme of three follow-up telephone assessments during the year following hospitalization. Data included clinical and sociodemographic factors as well as psychometric tools assessing PTSD, social support, and perception of threat to life (PTL). Mixture model analysis was performed to study the longitudinal course of PTSD symptoms. Chronic (>6 months) PTSD predictors were also analysed. Results: 1-year PTSD period prevalence was 23.9%, peaking at six months; 11% of the patients suffered chronic PTSD. Pre- and post-hospitalization factors influenced the onset and course of PTSD over time. These included working status, PTL, and lack of social support. Interestingly, obesity, pulmonary diseases and family cluster infection seem specifically related to PTSD following COVID-19. Inversely, clinical interventions, older age and male gender were protective. Conclusions: PTSD following COVID-19 hospitalization is common. The analysed demographic, social, clinical, and psychological factors predict PTSD symptomatology over time and can modify odds of a chronic course. Clinicians could better identify cases at risk of a chronic PTSD course. Finally, treatment as usual appeared related to a better outcome and should be proposed to patients with PTSD.",77

At the same time, some survivors report positive transformations resulting from the traumatic experience, a phenomenon known as post-traumatic growth (PTG). Although one might expect PTG to be related to reduced risk of revictimization, the link between PTG and revictimization has not been investigated. Furthermore, mixed findings regarding the associations between PTG and distress imply that the effects of PTG are multifaceted. One potential explanation may be that dissociation shapes the implications of PTG, making it more like denial than adaptive processing of traumatic experience. This longitudinal study explores (a) the associations between PTG and sexual revictimization and (b) the moderating role of dissociation within the associations between PTG and revictimization. Method: Participants were 111 female CSA survivors who participated in a 6-month efficacy trial evaluating the effectiveness of group psychotherapy for CSA survivors with HIV risk factors. Results: Dissociation moderated the associations between PTG and revictimization: Whereas PTG had nonsignificant effects on revictimization in participants with low dissociation, it predicted elevated levels of revictimization in participants with high dissociation. Conclusions: Reports of PTG among some CSA survivors might mirror dissociative beliefs that increase their risk of revictimization.",77

Design: Self-report and clinical assessments were done before and after an “index” deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. Setting, Participants, and Measures: Assessments took place on Marine Corps bases in southern California and the VA San Diego Medical Center. Participants were 1647 active-duty enlisted Marine and Navy servicemen who completed pre- and postdeployment assessments of the Marine Resiliency Study. The main outcome was the presence of tinnitus at 3 months postdeployment. Results: Predeployment TBI increased the likelihood of new-onset postdeployment tinnitus (odds ratio [OR] = 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.70). Deployment-related TBIs increased the likelihood of postdeployment tinnitus (OR = 2.65; 95% CI, 1.19-5.89).

Following a mass murder, this prospective, longitudinal study examined how reactions to media coverage, family reactions, and disappointment in social support influenced posttragedy MH (posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety), above and beyond the influence of pretragedy MH, pretragedy victimization, and objective exposure. University students who participated in a study of college adjustment prior to the mass murder ( n = 593) were recontacted and provided information on their posttragedy life ( n = 142). Students ( n = 84) also responded to open-ended questions about what was the most stressful part of the tragedy and psychological effects of the mass murder. After accounting for pretragedy victimization and MH, and objective exposure to events, hierarchical regression analyses indicated that distress related to media coverage and stronger family reactions contributed to higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms and anxiety, but not depression. Disappointment with social support was not significantly related to posttragedy MH. Common themes in student comments include grief, feeling vulnerable/unsafe, concern for the impact on others, stress related to media coverage, proximity to the events, changes in psychosocial adjustment, and returning to daily life. Results suggest that negative reactions to media coverage and family reactions that are overprotective or distressing negatively affect survivors’ MH, beyond their objective exposure to the violence, pretragedy MH, and pretragedy victimization.",77

Most people who experience such events recover from them, but people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) continue to be severely depressed and anxious for months or even years following the event. Palestinians are especially at a higher risk for developing anxiety disorders and PTSD due to their chronic exposure to political violence, prolonged displacement, and others as a limited professional, educational, financial opportunities, and mental health services. This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the literature and established studies concerning Anxiety disorders besides PTSD in Palestine.Methods PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar was used to search for materials, for the critical analysis of empirical articles, the following aspects were considered: study type, sample, and the key findings.Results Twenty-four studies from Palestine (West Bank and Gaza) were included in this review. Five studies related to children, five related to Adolescent, three related to women, three related to physical diseases and four related to gender and age differences . Results showed that anxiety disorders and PTSD were one of the most common mental disorders in Palestine. Anxiety and PTSD develop from a complex set of risk factors, including genetics, personality, and life events. They are highly associated with poor quality of life and disability. The results indicate that a significant proportion of Palestinian experiencing serious psychological distress especially anxiety and PTSD. Therefore, a mental health policy for Palestinians must deal with several challenges. Distinct barriers including inconsistent availability of medications, absence of multidisciplinary teamwork, insufficient specialists, fragmented mental health system, and occupation need to be addressed.Conclusion As a primary prevention, occupation has to be considered as a main source of the anxiety and other mental health disorders in Palestine.

The identification of a class characterized by an increasing trajectory of depression symptoms across the transition to adulthood is a novel finding. Of the risk and protective factors assessed, only initial student status and perceived family support helped prospectively distinguish between trajectory classes—students with higher depression symptomology in late adolescence are at increased risk for depression across the transition to adulthood, while perceived family social support in late adolescence is a protective factor associated with reduced probability of being in more symptomatic depression trajectories. Although limitations related to sample size warrant due caution, the findings still have diagnostic, prevention, and treatment implications related to the prospective differentiation of diverging depression symptom trajectories (i.e., multifinality) in the transition to adulthood.",77
https://openalex.org/W4318586270,10.17583/generos.9609,Post-Traumatic Growth Following the Experience of Interpersonal Violence: The Roles of Perceived Stigma and Social Support,"Post-Traumatic Growth is a term that refers to an individual's experience of considerable positive transformation following the occurrence of a traumatic event. This growth may be rapid, gradual, or non-existent, depending on the circumstances (such as social support or societal stigma) to which the victims are subjected during the process. However, the high prevalence of trauma among traumatized victims and the benefits of post-traumatic growth (PTG) discovered in increasing empirical research demonstrate the need of fostering PTG in victims of interpersonal violence. As a result, the current study analysed risk variables for PTG development. The study enrolled 200 women and men recruited through an organization that provides services to trauma victims. The data were gathered via an online survey that included the PTG inventory and an information sheet on demographic, social support, and stigma-related characteristics. Social stigma and support were found to be significant predictors of PTG, with stigma being associated with lower PTG and family and religious support being associated with higher PTG. The limitations and policy implications were highlighted, and recommendations for additional research were presented.",77

Consequently, the goal of this study was to conduct a prospective investigation of the moderating role of emotion dysregulation (assessed through self-report and behavioral measures) in the relation between PTS symptoms and substance use 8-months later within a sample of 106 young adult women. No main effect of PTS symptoms on substance use was found. Instead, PTS symptoms were only associated with later substance use in the context of heightened emotion dysregulation. Results provide support for emotion dysregulation as a key factor that may increase risk for substance use among women experiencing PTS symptoms and highlight a target for future interventions aimed at reducing risk for the development of maladaptive behaviors stemming from PTS symptoms.",78

We tracked PTSD symptoms among trauma-exposed individuals in the United States and sought to identify population-based variability in PTSD symptom trajectories and understand what, if any, early pandemic experiences predicted membership in one trajectory versus others. As part of a longitudinal study of U.S. residents during the pandemic, participants who reported at least one potentially traumatic experience in their lifetime (N = 1,206) at Wave 1 (April 2020) were included in the current study. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PCL-5 at four time points extending to July 2021. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify heterogeneous symptom trajectories. Trajectory membership was regressed on experiences from the early stage of the pandemic as measured using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory in a model that controlled for variables with documented associations to PTSD trajectories, including age, sex, income, and trauma history. Four trajectories were identified, categorized as resilient (73.0%), recurring (13.3%), recovering (8.3%), and chronic (5.5%). Emotional and physical health problems and positive changes associated with the early phase of the pandemic were each significant predictors of trajectory membership over and above all other variables in the model. Predictors primarily differentiated the resilient trajectory from each of the other three trajectories. Distinct PTSD symptom trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest a need for targeted efforts to help individuals at most risk for ongoing distress.",78

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Maternal trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress symptoms were measured using the Modified Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale at baseline and 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome was directly observed maternal-child interactions at 12-month corrected age using the Coding Interactive Behavior Manual. We used linear regression models to estimate the associations between trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms (and symptom clusters), and observer-rated maternal-child interactions. Results: Among the 236 participants, 89 (37.7%) self-reported as Black and 98 (41.5%) as Latina; mean gestational age of the infants was 31.6 weeks (SD 2.6). Mothers with posttraumatic stress symptoms demonstrated greater maternal sensitivity (β = 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06–0.58; standardized effect size = 0.39) and greater dyadic reciprocity (β = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.04–0.73; standardized effect size = 0.36) compared with those not exposed to trauma; however, we did not observe significant differences between trauma-exposed but asymptomatic women and those not exposed to trauma. Across symptom clusters, differences in maternal sensitivity and dyadic reciprocity were most pronounced for mothers with avoidance and re-experiencing symptoms, but not hyperarousal symptoms. Conclusion: Maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms seem to be associated with the quality of maternal-child interactions at age 1 year among a cohort of urban, mother-preterm infant dyads. These findings have implications for strength-based intervention development.",78

However, the phenomenon of PTG remains poorly understood among refugees. Previous findings are also contradictory on whether more PTSS associate with PTG and what specific symptoms or aspects of growth may account for any possible link.Here, we aimed to better understand posttraumatic growth among refugees, especially its structure and most important constituent elements, as well as how it associates with PTSS. We employed regression and network analysis methods with a large sample (N = 3,159) of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in Turkey self-reporting on PTG and PTSS.We found PTG and PTSS to be clearly distinct phenomena. Still, they often co-occurred, with a positive, slightly U-shaped relationship found between levels of PTSS and PTG. The main bridge between the constructs was identified from intrusive symptoms to having new priorities in life, although new priorities were more peripheral to the overall network structure of PTG. Meanwhile, discovering new psychological strengths and abilities and a new path in life emerged as elements most central to PTG itself.Many refugees report elements of PTG, even as they suffer from significant PTSS. The two phenomena appear distinct but positively associated, supporting the idea that intense cognitive processing involving distress may be necessary for growth after trauma. Our findings may inform efforts to support refugee trauma survivors in finding meaning and perhaps even growth after highly challenging experiences.Antecedentes: Los eventos traumáticos relacionados con la guerra y el desplazamiento pueden conducir al desarrollo de síntomas de estrés postraumático (SEPT), pero muchos sobrevivientes de traumas de guerra también informan que experimentan un crecimiento postraumático (CPT). Sin embargo, el fenómeno de CPT sigue siendo poco comprendido entre los refugiados. Los hallazgos previos también son contradictorios sobre si más SEPT se asocian con CPT y qué síntomas o aspectos específicos del crecimiento pueden explicar cualquier posible vínculo.Objetivo y Método: Aquí, nuestro objetivo fue comprender mejor el crecimiento postraumático entre los refugiados, especialmente su estructura y los elementos constitutivos más importantes, así como también de que forma se asocia con los SEPT. Empleamos métodos de análisis de red y regresión con una muestra grande (N = 3159) de refugiados sirios e iraquíes que están viviendo en Turquía y que informan sobre CPT y SEPT.Resultados: Encontramos que CPT y SEPT son fenómenos claramente distintos. Sin embargo, a menudo coincidieron, con una relación positiva, ligeramente en forma de U, encontrada entre los niveles de SEPT y CPT. El principal puente entre los constructos fue identificado desde los síntomas intrusivos a tener nuevas prioridades en la vida, aunque las nuevas prioridades eran más periféricas a la estructura de red general de CPT. Mientras tanto, el descubrimiento de nuevas fortalezas y capacidades psicológicas y un nuevo camino en la vida emergieron como elementos más centrales para el CPT en sí.Conclusiones: Muchos refugiados reportan elementos de CPT, incluso mientras sufren de SEPT significativo. Los dos fenómenos parecen distintos pero asociados positivamente, apoyando la idea de que un procesamiento cognitivo intenso que involucre angustia puede ser necesario para el crecimiento después del trauma. Nuestros hallazgos pueden informar los esfuerzos para ayudar a los refugiados sobrevivientes de trauma a encontrar significado y tal vez incluso crecer después de experiencias altamente desafiantes.背景：战争和流亡相关创伤事件可能导致创伤后应激症状 (PTSS) 的发展，但许多战争创伤幸存者也报告体验到了创伤后成长 (PTG)。然而，对难民中 PTG 现象仍然知之甚少。先前关于更多 PTSS 是否与 PTG 相关以及哪些特定症状或成长方面有任何可能连接上的研究结果有所矛盾。目的与方法：在这里，我们旨在更好地了解难民的创伤后成长，尤其是其结构和最重要的构成元素，以及它如何与 PTSS 相关联。我们对一个居住在土耳其的叙利亚和伊拉克难民的大样本 (N = 3,159)中进行自我报告的 PTG 和 PTSS采用回归和网络分析方法。结果：我们发现 PTG 和 PTSS 是明显不同的现象。尽管如此，它们经常同时发生，在 PTSS 和 PTG 水平之间发现呈正的、略呈 U 形的关系。构念之间的主要桥接被确定为从闯入症状到有新的生活优先事项，尽管新的优先事项在 PTG 整体网络结构中更为边缘。同时，发现新的心理力量和能力以及新的人生道路成为 PTG 本身最核心的元素。结论：许多难民即使患有严重的 PTSS，还是报告了 PTG 元素。这两种现象看似不同但呈正相关，支持了涉及心理痛苦的强烈认知加工可能对于创伤后成长是必需的这一观点。我们的研究结果可能为支持难民创伤幸存者在极具挑战性的经历后寻找意义甚至成长的工作提供信息。.",78

During this conflict, more than 300 settlements have been built inside West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem “Occupied Palestinian Territories”, since that time the conflict between Palestinian and Israeli occupation forces is still ongoing. One of the most important results of this occupation and conflict is the suffering of Palestinian living among these Israeli settlements. Therefore, this study aimed at gaining insight into the impact of living within this situation on children and adolescents’ psychological wellbeing. 357 8-18 years old Palestinian children took part; Two self-report questionnaires: the UCLA-PTSD-Reaction Index, investigating symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires, looking at overall psychological problems, were filed by children themselves, mothers, and teachers. Descriptive analyses investigated mental health differences between both variables, gender, and age, and the mental health outcomes.

Recent machine learning approaches have yielded insight into predicting PTSD symptom trajectories. Using data collected within 1 month of traumatic injury, we applied eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) to classify admitted and discharged patients (hospitalized, n = 192; nonhospitalized, n = 214), recruited from a Level 1 trauma center, according to PTSD symptom trajectories. Trajectories were identified using latent class mixed models on PCL‐5 scores collected at baseline, 1–3 months posttrauma, and 6 months posttrauma. In both samples, nonremitting, remitting, and resilient PTSD symptom trajectories were identified. In the admitted patient sample, a unique delayed trajectory emerged. Machine learning classifiers (i.e., XGB) were developed and tested on the admitted patient sample and externally validated on the discharged sample with biological and clinical self‐report baseline variables as predictors. For external validation sets, prediction was fair for nonremitting versus other trajectories, areas under the curve (AUC = .70); good for nonremitting versus resilient trajectories, AUCs = .73–.76; and prediction failed for nonremitting versus remitting trajectories, AUCs = .46–.48. However, poor precision (&lt; .57) across all models suggests limited generalizability of nonremitting symptom trajectory prediction from admitted to discharged patient samples. Consistency in symptom trajectory identification across samples supports prior studies on the stability of PTSD symptom trajectories following trauma exposure; however, continued work and replication with larger samples are warranted to understand overlapping and unique predictive features of PTSD in different traumatic injury populations.",78

To characterize long-term bereavement outcomes, including resilience/recovery and patterns of comorbidity, following the September 11, 2001 (9/11), terrorist attacks, we report mental health conditions and grief-related impairment in 454 9/11 bereaved family members. In addition, the contribution of non-9/11 lifetime traumas, pre-9/11 mental health conditions, post-9/11 interim life events, grief services, income adequacy, and social support were examined. Latent class analyses yielded three groups: healthy, comorbid without PTSD (comorbid/noPTSD), and comorbid with PTSD and impaired (comorbid/PTSD+I). Participants in the healthy group (66.1%) were least likely to meet thresholds for mental conditions, whereas those in the comorbid/noPTSD (21.3%) and comorbid/PTSD+I (12.6%) groups had higher probabilities of meeting depression, grief, and anxiety thresholds. These groups also endorsed more negatively valenced post-9/11 interim life events than the healthy group: comorbid/noPTSD vs. healthy, odds ratio (OR) = 0.84, 95% CI [0.76, 0.94]; comorbid/PTSD+I vs. healthy, OR = 0.85, 95% CI [0.76, 0.96].

Previous studies have identified an increased risk of prostate cancer in responder cohorts compared with the general male population.To estimate the length of time to prostate cancer among WTC rescue/recovery workers by determining specific time periods during which the risk was significantly elevated.Person-time accruals began 6 months after enrolment into a WTC cohort and ended at death or 12/31/2015. Cancer data were obtained through linkages with 13 state cancer registries. New York State was the comparison population. We used Poisson regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CIs; change points in rate ratios were estimated using profile likelihood.The analytic cohort included 54 394 male rescue/recovery workers. We observed 1120 incident prostate cancer cases. During 2002-2006, no association with WTC exposure was detected. Beginning in 2007, a 24% increased risk (HR: 1.24, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.32) was observed among WTC rescue/recovery workers when compared with New York State. Comparing those who arrived earliest at the disaster site on the morning of 11 September 2001 or any time on 12 September 2001 to those who first arrived later, we observed a positive, monotonic, dose-response association in the early (2002-2006) and late (2007-2015) periods.Risk of prostate cancer was significantly elevated beginning in 2007 in the WTC combined rescue/recovery cohort. While unique exposures at the disaster site might have contributed to the observed effect, screening practices including routine prostate specific antigen screening cannot be discounted.",78

This study examined 2 focal research questions: (i) What is the prevalence of experiencing MST during deployment among male Reserve and National Guard soldiers? and (ii) to what extent is the degree of MST exposure during deployment associated with frequent heavy drinking and alcohol problems postdeployment? Methods Data from male soldiers who had been deployed ( N = 248) were drawn from the baseline wave of Operation: SAFETY (Soldiers And Families Excelling Through the Years) an ongoing study examining health among U.S. Army Reserve and National Guard and their partners. Participants were recruited over a 15‐month period (Summer 2014 to Fall 2015) from units in New York State. Deployments occurred prior to the baseline wave of the study. Analyses examined the relation between degree of MST exposure during soldiers’ most recent deployment and (i) frequent heavy drinking and (ii) alcohol problems, measured at baseline, controlling for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and age. Results 17.3% of the male service members reported experiencing MST during their most recent deployment. Further, greater MST exposure was associated with a greater likelihood of engaging in frequent heavy drinking (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.03, 95% CI [1.01, 1.05]) and experiencing alcohol problems ( aRR = 1.03, 95% CI [1.01, 1.06]) at baseline. Conclusions Findings demonstrate that MST rates are high among male Reserve and National Guard soldiers, and greater MST exposure is associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in frequent heavy drinking and experiencing alcohol problems among a population already at risk for problematic alcohol use.",78

  symptom trajectories with AI-based language analyses of interviews","Background: Oral histories from 9/11 responders to the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks provide rich narratives about distress and resilience. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models promise to detect psychopathology in natural language, but they have been evaluated primarily in non-clinical settings using social media. This study sought to test the ability of AI-based language assessments to predict PTSD symptom trajectories among responders. Methods: Participants were 124 responders whose health was monitored at the Stony Brook WTC Health and Wellness Program who completed oral history interviews about their initial WTC experiences. PTSD symptom severity was measured longitudinally using the PTSD Checklist (PCL) for up to 7 years post-interview. AI-based indicators were computed for depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and extraversion along with dictionary-based measures of linguistic and interpersonal style. Linear regression and multilevel models estimated associations of AI indicators with concurrent and subsequent PTSD symptom severity (significance adjusted by false discovery rate). Results: Cross-sectionally, greater depressive language (beta=0.32; p=0.043) and first-person singular usage (beta=0.31; p=0.044) were associated with increased symptom severity. Longitudinally, anxious language predicted future worsening in PCL scores (beta=0.31; p=0.031), whereas first-person plural usage (beta=-0.37; p=0.007) and longer words usage (beta=-0.36; p=0.007) predicted improvement. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate the value of AI in understanding PTSD in a vulnerable population.

Information is presented on prevalence of acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); course, functional impairment, suicide risk, cognitive impairment, accelerated aging, healthcare utilization in older adults with PTSD, and the impact of demographic factors such as gender, ethnicity, and race on PTSD in older individuals. In general, rates of ASD and PTSD are lower in older adults compared to other age groups. PTSD in older adults has been linked to suicidal ideation and attempts, functional impairment, physical health, cognitive impairment, accelerated aging, and increased healthcare utilization. Although delayed onset of PTSD has been empirically verified in some military samples with veterans and younger adult civilians, it is rare in the absence of any prior symptoms and might more accurately be labeled “delayed recognition.” More information on trauma and PTSD in diverse populations of older adults is needed, such as racial/ethnic as well as sexual and gender minorities, those with severe physical or mental impairment, non–community-residing groups, and those from non-industrialized countries.",78

Seventy-seven people were killed, and many injured. Rescue workers from five occupational groups and unaffiliated volunteers faced death and despair to assist victims. To investigate the level of, and associations between, demographic variables, exposure and work-related variables and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). A cross-sectional study of general and psychosocial health care personnel, police officers, firefighters, affiliated and unaffiliated volunteers were conducted ~10 months after the terror attacks. The respondents answered a self-reported questionnaire. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist – specific (PCL-S) assessed PTSS. There were 1790 participants; response rate was 61%. About 70% of the professional rescue workers had previous work experience with similar tasks or had participated in training or disaster drills. They assessed the rescue work as a success. Firefighters and unaffiliated volunteers reported more perceived threat compared with the other groups. Among the professional personnel, the prevalence of sub-threshold PTSD (PCL 35–49) was 2% and possible PTSD (PCL ≥ 50) 0.3%. The corresponding figures among the unaffiliated volunteers were 24% and 15%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, female gender (β = 1.7), witnessing injured/dead (β = 2.0), perceived threat (β = 1.1), perceived obstruction in rescue work (β = 1.6), lower degree of previous training (β = −0. 9) and being unaffiliated volunteers (β = 8.3) were significantly associated with PTSS. In the aftermath of a terror attack, professional rescue workers appear to be largely protected from post-traumatic stress reactions, while unaffiliated volunteers seem to be at higher risk.",78

In the current study, we added problem‐solving training to CA‐CBT and evaluated this treatment (i.e., CA‐CBT+) in a randomized controlled pilot trial with a sample of Farsi‐speaking refugees. Participants ( N = 24) were male refugees diagnosed with DSM‐5 PTSD, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders who were randomly assigned to either a treatment or waitlist control (WLC) condition. Treatment components were adapted both to the specific cultural background and the current social problems of asylum seekers. Assessments were performed pretreatment, 12‐weeks posttreatment, and 1‐year follow‐up. The primary treatment outcome was the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ‐28); secondary outcome measures included the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, Patient Health Questionnaire, Somatic Symptom Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life, and Emotion Regulation Scale. Eleven of 12 participants were randomized to CA‐CBT+ completed treatment. Based on intent‐to‐treat data, large between‐group effect sizes were seen at posttreatment in the GHQ‐28, d = 3.0, and for most secondary outcome measures. Improvements for individuals in the treatment group decreased at 1‐year follow‐up, but effect sizes demonstrated continued large improvements on all measures as compared to pretreatment levels. In summary, CA‐CBT+ led to large improvements in general psychopathological distress and quality of life, which were maintained in the long term. In addition, the dropout rate was very low, with delivery in group format. Thus, problem‐solving training appears to be a promising addition to CA‐CBT.",78

The aim of this study was to investigate whether changes in posttraumatic cognitions mediate treatment effects. Participants were multitraumatized youth (N = 156, mean age = 15.1 years, range = 10-18; 79.5% girls) randomly assigned to receive trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) or treatment-as-usual (TAU). Mixed-effects models were applied to investigate the impact of treatment conditions on posttraumatic cognitions. Mediation analyses were applied to examine whether changes in posttraumatic cognitions mediated the relationship between treatment conditions and outcome in posttraumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, and general mental health. Participants receiving TF-CBT reported significantly lower levels of negative posttraumatic cognitions at the end of treatment compared to participants in TAU. Change in posttraumatic cognitions mediated the treatment effect difference found for PTSS. When the overall change in cognition was divided into early and late changes, it was only the late change that significantly mediated the PTSS treatment effect. A mediation effect of posttraumatic cognitions was also found for the treatment effect difference in depressive symptoms and in general mental health symptoms. Traumatized youth report having many negative posttraumatic cognitions and changes in negative cognitions plays a key role for treatment outcome. (PsycINFO Database Record",78

Operational stress injury (OSI) is a broad term used to describe persistent psychological difficulties resulting from activities performed in the course of or related to one's job. Several OSIs associated specifically with policing have received empirical attention and support. Among others, these include posttraumatic stress, depression, alcohol use disorders, and relatedly, suicide. Both empirical evidence and clinical experience are drawn upon in this chapter as we review the risks for posttraumatic stress disorder among police officers, as well as the prevalence, etiology, and trajectory of this condition in the context of the police role. We also discuss evidence-based treatments for PTSD. In addition, we outline other types of OSI commonly experienced in this population. Finally, we present a discussion of posttraumatic growth as it relates to police officers and its implications for clinical contexts.",78

https://openalex.org/W2791779453,10.1371/journal.pone.0191655,Population-based cohort study of the impacts of mild traumatic brain injury in adults four years post-injury,"There is increasing evidence that some people can experience persistent symptoms for up to a year following mild TBI. However, few longitudinal studies of mild TBI exist and the longer-term impact remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine if there are long-term effects of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) four-years later. Adults (aged ≥16 years) identified as part of a TBI incidence study who experienced a mild-TBI four-years ago (N = 232) were compared to age-sex matched controls (N = 232). Sociodemographic variables, prior TBI and symptoms were assessed at the time of injury. Four years post-injury participants completed the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools. Analysis of covariance was used to compare differences between TBI cases four years post-injury and controls, controlling for prior TBI and depression. A multiple regression model was used to identify the predictors of increased symptoms and reduced participation. The mild-TBI sample experienced significantly increased self-reported cognitive symptoms (F = 19.90, p = <0.01) four years post-injury than controls. There were no differences between the groups for somatic (F = 0.02, p = 0.89) or emotional symptoms (F = 0.31, p = 0.58). Additionally, the mild-TBI group reported significantly poorer community participation across all three domains: productivity (F = 199.07, p = <0.00), social relations (F = 13.93, p = <0.00) and getting out and about (F = 364.69, p = <0.00) compared to controls. A regression model accounting for 41% of the variance in cognitive symptoms in TBI cases revealed a history of TBI, receiving acute medical attention and baseline cognitive symptoms, sleep quality, anxiety and depression were predictive of outcome. The results indicate that whilst somatic and emotional symptoms resolve over time, cognitive symptoms can become persistent and that mild TBI can impact longer-term community participation. Early intervention is needed to reduce the longer-term impact of cognitive symptoms and facilitate participation.",79

The current study focuses on two issues: first, a new index to measure individual resilience based on recovery to distress symptoms ratio; second, examining five demographic characteristics and sense of danger as predictors of individual resilience. Path analysis indicated that individual resilience significantly correlated negatively with sense of danger and exposure (β=-0.34), and positively with level of religiosity (β=0.24) and income (β=0.17). Sense of danger mediated the associations between area of living, community size and level of exposure and individual resilience.

In this study, we derived trajectories of depressive symptoms in adolescents and examined the codevelopment of multiple behavioral and academic problems in these trajectories.Participants were 6,910 students from secondary schools primarily located in disadvantaged areas of Quebec (Canada) who were assessed annually from the age 12 to 16 years. Trajectories were identified using growth mixture modeling. The course of behavioral (delinquency, substance use) and academic adjustment (school liking, academic achievement) in trajectories was examined by deriving latent growth curves for each covariate conditional on trajectory membership.We identified five trajectories of stable-low (68.1%), increasing (12.1%), decreasing (8.7%), transient (8.7%), and stable-high (2.4%) depressive symptoms. Examination of conditional latent growth curves revealed that the course of behavioral and academic problems closely mirrored the course of depressive symptoms in each trajectory.This pattern of results suggests that the course of depressive symptoms and other adjustment problems over time is likely to involve an important contribution of shared underlying developmental process(es).",79

However, the impact of polyvictimization on the longitudinal co‐development of PTSS and distinct forms of externalizing problems remains unclear. Growth trajectory modeling was used to address this gap. At ages 8, 12, and 16, polyvictimization was measured using youth, caregiver, and official records; whereas youth self‐reported PTSS and caregivers reported aggression and delinquency. Results demonstrate that changes in PTSS and each externalizing domain were independent. Further, polyvictimization and PTSS/aggression were only associated at concurrent time points. In contrast, polyvictimization and delinquency were generally associated at concurrent and distal time points, suggesting that polyvictimization may have a more enduring impact on youths' delinquent behaviors than other symptoms.",79
https://openalex.org/W3095119698,,The role of resilience resources in predicting post-deployment adjustment: A Longitudinal Study,"Military service members are exposed to life-threatening circumstances and hostile working conditions during deployment. This puts them at risk of developing stress-related psychological health problems after deployment. Recent research has shown that in addition to a short-term symptom increase within the first six months after deployment, there is a subsequent long-term symptom increase at five years after deployment. Currently, there is no clear explanation of why some service members suffer from this delayed onset of stress symptoms, whereas others are able to positively adjust themselves in the long term. The present research focuses on the role of resilience resources before and during deployment as potential predictors of long-term post-deployment adjustment. Resilience can be seen as a process in which internal and external resources interact with demands to result in positive outcomes. We expected that the presence of a diverse set of resources before and during stressful experiences would not only influence short-term outcomes but also long-term adaptation, because of the emergence of resource loss and resource gain cycles (cf. Conservation of Resources Theory). To investigate this, we measured resilience resources using the Dutch Military Resilience Monitor before (n = 786) and during (n = 736) deployment in service members of the Netherlands Armed Forces participating in the NATO ISAF mission and the NATO Anti-Piracy Mission in 2012/2013. Five years later, in 2018, we conducted a follow-up, measuring various indicators of (lack of) adjustment (i.e. quality of life, well-being, post-traumatic stress symptoms, burnout and depression). In this presentation, preliminary results will be discussed.",79

This study presents an overview of these three mental health problems associated with deployment among Air Force, Army, Marine Corp, and Navy service members returning from deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan between January 2007 and March 2008. With postdeployment health data on over 50,000 service men and women, including diagnostic information, we were able to estimate prevalence of those who screened positive for risk of each disorder in self-report data at two time points, as well as prevalence of diagnoses received during health care encounters within the military health care system. The prevalence ranges of the three disorders were consistent with previous studies using similar measures, but service members in the Navy had higher rates of screening positive for all three disorders and higher prevalence of depression and PTSD diagnoses compared to the other branches. Further, PTSD risk was higher for service members returning from Afghanistan compared to Iraq, in contrast to previous findings.",79

Methods Survey administration took place in the spring of 2015 to a spatially stratified, random sample of households. This analysis included a total of 294 subjects who lived in 1 of the 3 counties of the Mississippi Gulf Coast at the time of both Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The survey included the Communities Advancing Resilience Toolkit (CART) scale, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Results There was a significant inverse relationship between psychological resilience and depressive symptoms and a significant positive relationship between community resilience and psychological resilience. The results also revealed that community resilience was indirectly related to depressive symptoms through the mediating variable of psychological resilience. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of psychological resilience in long-term disaster recovery and imply that long-term recovery efforts should address factors associated with both psychological and community resilience to improve mental health outcomes.

Factors that moderate the relationship between disaster exposure and enhanced suicide risk are unknown. The aim of the current study was to determine whether pre-disaster PTSD moderates the association between change over time in thoughts of death, suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plans, and suicide attempts (SA) from pre- to post-disaster.Participants (n = 2832) were recruited from Chile as part of the larger PREDICT study and completed a measure of lifetime PTSD and panic disorder at baseline and a lifetime death/suicide measure at baseline in 2003 and again 6, 12, and 24 months later (i.e. ""pre-disaster""). One year following a major earthquake and tsunami in 2010 (i.e., ""post-disaster""), participants completed another death/suicide measure.Both those with and without pre-disaster PTSD experienced significant increases in SI from pre- to post-disaster. However, pre-disaster PTSD was associated with significantly accelerated increases in thoughts of death and SI from pre-to post-disaster. At nearly all time-points, pre-disaster PTSD was associated with higher thoughts of death and SI, suicide planning, and SA. In contrast, panic disorder did not moderate the association between time and changes in SI.There was a long time-gap between pre-disaster and post-disaster, with limited data about what occurred during this time.Pre-disaster PTSD is an important predictor of increased SI following a natural disaster, and groups with pre-disaster PTSD should be prioritized for receipt of mental health resources following a natural disaster.",79

We studied which events people considered to be the “worst” in their lifetimes to gain a better understanding of the types of events individuals consider to be distressing. This longitudinal study included a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents living outside New York ( N = 1,606) who were exposed to the September 11th, 2001 (9/11) terror attacks exclusively via the media. Bereavement was the most frequently cited “worst” life event (42.0%); violent events were cited by 11.4% of the sample. However, 22.0% of respondents reported 9/11 as their worst life event even though they did not directly experience the attacks. More lifetime exposure to violent events and bereavement, odds ratios ( OR s) = 0.79 and 0.72, respectively, and a college education, OR = 0.61, were associated with decreased odds of naming 9/11 as one's worst life event. Watching 4 or more hours of 9/11‐related television coverage in the week after the attacks, OR = 1.67, and identifying as African American, OR = 2.01, were associated with increased odds of naming 9/11 as one's worst life event 1 year after the attacks. Events experienced indirectly through the media may be considered the worst of people's lives, with important implications for assessing stressful life event history and understanding indirect exposure to negative life events.",79

The present study seeks to identify factors that influence PTSD symptom load across pregnancy and early postpartum, and study its impact on postpartum adaptation.The current study is a secondary analysis on pregnant women with a Lifetime PTSD diagnosis (N = 319) derived from a larger community sample who were interviewed twice across pregnancy (28 and 35 weeks) and again at 6 weeks postpartum, assessing socioeconomic risks, mental health, past and ongoing trauma exposure, and adaptation to postpartum.Using trajectory analysis, first we examined the natural course of PTSD symptoms based on patterns across peripartum, and found four distinct trajectory groups. Second, we explored factors (demographic, historical, and gestational) that shape the PTSD symptom trajectories, and examined the impact of trajectory membership on maternal postpartum adaptation. We found that child abuse history, demographic risk, and lifetime PTSD symptom count increased pregnancy-onset PTSD risk, whereas gestational PTSD symptom trajectory was best predicted by interim trauma and labor anxiety. Women with the greatest PTSD symptom rise during pregnancy were most likely to suffer postpartum depression and reported greatest bonding impairment with their infants at 6 weeks postpartum.Screening for modifiable risks (interpersonal trauma exposure and labor anxiety) and /or PTSD symptom load during pregnancy appears critical to promote maternal wellbeing.",79

It is not clear, however, whether reduced HRV before trauma exposure contributes to the risk for development of PTSD.To examine whether HRV before combat deployment is associated with increased risk of a PTSD diagnosis after deployment when accounting for deployment-related combat exposure.Between July 14, 2008, and May 24, 2012, active-duty Marines were assessed 1 to 2 months before a combat deployment and again 4 to 6 months after their return. The first phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-I) included 1415 male Marines, 59 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Participants in the second phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-II) included 745 male Marines, 25 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Analysis was conducted from November 25, 2013, to April 16, 2015.Predeployment HRV was measured via finger photoplethysmography during a 5-minute period of rest. Frequency-domain measures of HRV were generated. Diagnosis of PTSD was determined using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale.After accounting for deployment-related combat exposure, lower HRV before deployment as measured by an increased low-frequency (LF) to high-frequency (HF) ratio of HRV was associated with risk of PTSD diagnosis after deployment (combined MRS-I and MRS-II cohort meta-analysis odds ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-1.98; P = .01). The prevalence of postdeployment PTSD was higher in participants with high predeployment LF:HF ratios (15.8% [6 of 38 participants]) compared with participants who did not have high LF:HF ratios (3.7% [78 of 2122 participants]).This prospective longitudinal study provides initial and modest evidence that an altered state of autonomic nervous system functioning contributes to PTSD vulnerability, taking into account other key risk factors. If these findings are replicated, interventions that change autonomic nervous system function may open novel opportunities for prevention and treatment of PTSD.",79

One major factor associated with this improvement is community integration. Little is known about the trajectory of community integration and how it relates to other outcomes in adolescent survivors of severe burns. Methods: Using the Burn Model Systems (BMS) database, we identified adolescents with severe burn injuries from 2006-2020 with follow-up data at six and 12 months after discharge. We derived baseline community integration groups from the distribution of baseline community integration questionnaire (CIQ) scores. Using regression models, we identified factors associated with CIQ score over time and assessed the association between CIQ score and post-traumatic growth (PTG). Other outcome measurements of interest were compared across baseline CIQ groups using ANOVA analysis and Wilcoxon tests for trend. Results: The primary predictor of CIQ score after discharge was baseline CIQ score. On average, CIQ score declined at 6 months, improved by 1 year, and recovered by 2 years post-discharge. This pattern differed by race. Lower community integration at baseline, but not at 6 months, was associated with more anxiety, depression, and pain interference as well as poorer peer relationships. There was a curvilinear relationship for PTSD and linear relationship for PTG. Conclusions: Community integration is a baseline characteristic that is associated with outcomes for adolescent survivors of severe burns. Individuals who are socially isolated at baseline have sustained low community integration, are more likely to experience poor mental health outcomes, and are less likely to experience post-traumatic growth.",79

This follow-up study examined whether PTSD symptoms and/or depressive symptoms mediate the observed association between WTC exposure and subjective cognitive concerns. We included WTC-exposed FDNY workers who completed the Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI), measuring self-perceived cognitive decline (N = 9516). PTSD symptoms and depressive symptoms were assessed using the PCL-S and CES-D, respectively. Multivariable linear regression estimated the association between WTC exposure and CFI score, adjusting for confounders. Mediation analyses followed the methods of Vanderweele (2014). Participants’ average age at CFI assessment was 56.6 ± 7.6 years. Higher-intensity WTC exposure was associated with worse CFI score, an effect that was entirely mediated by PTSD symptoms (%mediated: 110.9%; 95%CI: 83.1–138.9). When substituting depressive symptoms for PTSD symptoms, the WTC exposure–CFI association was largely mediated (%mediated: 82.1%; 95%CI: 60.6–103.7). Our findings that PTSD symptoms and depressive symptoms mediate the association between WTC exposure and subjective cognitive concerns indicate that in the absence of these symptoms, WTC exposure in rescue/recovery workers would not be associated with subjective cognition. Interventions targeting PTSD and depression may have additional value in mitigating cognitive decline in WTC-exposed populations.",79

A prospective experience sampling method study,"While peritraumatic dissociation has been identified as a predictor of posttraumatic stress disorder, it may also have some protective aspect. The study uses experience sampling methods to assess acute dissociation reactions during conflict, and to investigate these reactions as predictors of subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and posttraumatic growth (PTG). During the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, Israeli civilians (n = 96) exposed to rocket fire gave twice-daily experience sampling method (ESM) reports of dissociation symptoms for 30 days via mobile phone. PTSS and PTG were assessed two months later. A mixed effects random intercepts and slopes model estimated acute dissociation reactions. Individual slope coefficients for acute dissociative reactivity were entered as predictors of subsequent PTSS and PTG in regression analyses investigating linear and curvilinear associations. Exposure to sirens elicited acute dissociation reactions. Dissociative reactivity gradually reduced over the conflict. Higher acute dissociative reactivity during conflict predicted PTSS in a curvilinear manner (inverted U) and PTG in a positive linear manner two months later. The current study provides an important and novel contribution to the field by using ESM methods to assess peritraumatic dissociation, and in demonstrating that peritraumatic dissociation may be both adaptive and maladaptive, which has implications for risk assessment and clinical practice.",79

The purpose of the current longitudinal study was to examine the dynamic relations between parents' depressive symptoms and children's cognitions, specifically their attributions for the causes of life events. Participants were 227 parent-child dyads with one parent (Mage = 42.19, SD = 6.82; 76% female) and one child (Mage = 12.53, SD = 2.33; 53% female) per family. Parents either were diagnosed with a current major depressive disorder (n= 129; 72.9% female) or were lifetime-free of mood disorders (n= 98; 79.6% female). The Beck Depression Inventory-II was used to obtain a dimensional measure of parents' depressive symptoms, and the Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire-Revised was used to assess children's attributions of negative and positive events. Evaluations were conducted 5 times across 22 months. We used latent difference score (LDS) modeling to examine the relations between changes in parents' depressive symptoms and changes in children's attributional style over time. The final model provided a close fit to the data: χ2(30) = 35.22, p = .24; comparative fit index = .995, root mean square error of approximation = .028, 90% confidence interval (CI) [.000, .060], standardized root mean square residual = .024. Parents' levels of depressive symptoms significantly predicted the worsening of children's attributions (i.e., becoming more pessimistic) over the 22 months, whereas children's attributions did not significantly predict changes in parents' depressive symptoms at the next time point. Preventive interventions should aim to both reduce parents' depression and teach children strategies for examining the accuracy of their beliefs regarding the causes of life events.",79

The objective of our study was to identify the factors associated with PTSD in the medium and longer term among people exposed to a terrorist attack in France. We used data from a longitudinal survey of 123 terror-exposed people interviewed 6-10 (medium term) and 18-22 (long term) months after. Mental health was assessed by the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview. PTSD in the medium term was associated with history of traumatic events, low levels of social support and severe peri-traumatic reactions, which were in turn associated with high levels of terror exposure. PTSD in the medium term was linked in turn to the presence of anxiety and depressive disorders, which was also linked to PTSD in the longer term. The factors leading to PTSD are different in the medium and long term. In order to improve future support for people exposed to distressing events, it is important to follow up people with intense peri-traumatic reactions, high levels of anxiety and depression and to measure reactions.",80

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between perceived radiation risk and other factors at baseline and mid-term mental health after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster of 2011 in Japan. A mail-based questionnaire survey was conducted in January 2012 and January 2013. Mental health status was assessed using the K6 scale. Psychological distress over the 2-year period was categorized into the following four groups: chronic, recovered, resistant, or worsened. Most participants (80.3%) were resistant to the disaster. A positive association was found between the radiation risk perception regarding immediate effects and the worsened group in women. Baseline post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a history of psychiatric disease predicted being in the chronic or worsened group in mid-term course. These results suggest that evacuees who believed that their health was substantially affected by the nuclear disaster were at an increased risk of having poor mid-term mental health in women. Careful assessment of risk perception after a nuclear disaster, including the presence of PTSD or a history of psychiatric disease, is needed for appropriate interventions.",80

This study examined the frequency and persistence of children’s sleep problems following a natural disaster, risk factors for children’s sleep problems, and the bidirectional relationship between children’s sleep problems and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) over time. Methods This study assessed 269 children (53% female, M = 8.70 years, SD = 0.95) exposed to Hurricane Ike at 8 months (Time 1) and 15 months (Time 2) post-disaster. Children completed measures of hurricane exposure and related stressors, stressful life events, sleep problems, and PTSS. Results Children’s sleep problems were significantly correlated from Time 1 to Time 2 (r = .28, p &amp;lt; .001). Risk factors for sleep problems at Time 2 were younger age, sleep problems at Time 1, and PTSS, not including sleep items, at Time 1. Examinations of the bidirectional relationship between sleep problems and PTSS indicated that PTSS significantly predicted later sleep problems, but sleep problems did not significantly predict later PTSS. Conclusions Findings demonstrate that PTSS may contribute to the development and course of children’s sleep problems post-disaster.",80

Despite considerable research on PTSD symptom clustering, it remains unknown how symptoms of PTSD re-organize following combat. Network analysis provides a powerful tool to examine such changes. Methods A network analysis approach was taken to examine how symptom networks change from pre- to post-combat using longitudinal prospective data from a cohort of infantry male soldiers ( M age = 18.8 years). PTSD symptoms measured using the PTSD Checklist (PCL) were assessed after 6 months of combat training but before deployment and again after 6 months of combat (Ns = 910 and 725 at pre-deployment and post-combat, respectively) Results Stronger connectivity between PTSD symptoms was observed post-combat relative to pre-deployment (global strength values of the networks were 7.54 pre v . 7.92 post; S = .38, p &lt; 0.05). Both the re-experiencing symptoms cluster (1.92 v . 2.12; S = .20, p &lt; 0.03) and the avoidance symptoms cluster (2.61 v . 2.96; S = .35, p &lt; 0.005) became more strongly inter-correlated post-combat. Centrality estimation analyses revealed that psychological reaction to triggers was central and linked the intrusion and avoidance sub-clusters at post-combat. The strength of associations between the arousal and reactivity symptoms cluster remained stable over time (1.85 v . 1.83; S = .02, p = .92). Conclusions Following combat, PTSD symptoms and particularly the re-experiencing and avoidance clusters become more strongly inter-correlated, indicating high centrality of trigger-reactivity symptoms.",80
https://openalex.org/W3216441300,,"An Evaluation of the Structure, Comorbidity, and Correlates of Posttraumatic Stress Responses in Older Adults Across Multiple National Samples","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD) are often chronic and debilitating conditions that can cause significant impairment in an individual’s personal, professional, and social life. However, research pertaining to posttraumatic stress responses among older adults is lacking. The present thesis aimed to address this gap in the literature by evaluating the structure, psychiatric comorbidity, and correlates of posttraumatic stress responses among older adults. The most contemporary models of PTSD (as outlined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM-5] and the eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases [ICD-11]) provided a valid representation of PTSD among older adults. Four DSM-5 symptoms demonstrated sex item-bias, with females being more likely to endorse three symptoms (B1: 'unwanted memories', B4: 'feeling upset', and E6: 'sleep problems') and males being more likely to endorse one symptom (E2: ‘reckless or self-destructive behaviour’). Alternatively, there was no evidence of item-bias for the six ICD-11 symptoms. Regarding comorbidity, a dimensional framework of psychopathology was successful in accounting for the psychiatric comorbidities of PTSD. More specifically, evidence supported the existence of two distinct subtypes of ICD-11 PTSD psychiatric comorbidity classes among older adults, with the higher comorbidity class being associated with a history of attempted suicide. In terms of PTSD/CPTSD correlates, evidence of longitudinal relationships between subtypes of loneliness (social and emotional) and PTSD, and cross-sectional relationships between loneliness and CPTSD symptoms were found in older adults. These results have important implications for both research and clinical practice regarding the assessment and treatment of PTSD and CPTSD in later life. These findings imply that the current diagnostic models of PTSD are applicable in older adults; identify the psychiatric 
disorders that are likely to manifest alongside PTSD in later life; and highlight loneliness as a clinically meaningful construct among trauma-exposed older adults.",80

Many battle casualties (BCs) have been reported in the recent deployment to Afghanistan. The long-term impact of these combat injuries, at their five-year end point, is currently unknown. To date, no systematic inventory has been performed of an identified group of BCs in comparison to non-injured service members from the same operational theatre.Observational cross-sectional cohort study.Open online survey among Dutch BCs that deployed to Afghanistan (2006-2010).The Dutch BCs (n = 62) were compared to two control groups of non-injured combat groups (battle exposed [n = 53], and non-battle exposed [n = 73]).Participants rated their impact of trauma exposure (Impact of Events [IES]), post deployment reintegration (Post Deployment Reintegration Scale [PDRS]), general symptoms of distress (Symptom Checklist 90 [SCL-90]), as well as their current perceived quality of life (EuroQol-6D [EQ-6D]). Also cost effectiveness (Short From health survey [SF-36]) and care consumption were assessed (Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire).Over 90% of BCs were still in active duty. The mean scores of all questionnaires (IES, EQ-6D, SF-36, and SCL-90) of the BC group were significantly higher than in the control groups (p<0.05). The PDRS showed a significantly lower (p<0.05) outcome in the negative subscales. The mean consumption of care was triple that of both control groups. A lower score on quality of life was related to higher levels of distress and impact of trauma exposure.This study showed a clear long-term impact on a wide range of scales that contributes to a reduced quality of life in a group of BCs. Low perceived cost effectiveness matched with high consumption of care in the BC group in comparison to the control groups. These results warrant continuous monitoring of BCs.",80

Setting: Outpatient research setting. Participants: Twenty-seven adolescents (aged of 13-17 years) within 1 week of a concussion/mTBI and a parent/guardian were enrolled in the study. Design: Prospective ecological study with qualitative, semistructured interviews. Main Measures: Adolescents reported symptoms electronically every 2 days for 28 days via the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory. Semistructured interviews were completed with each adolescent-parent dyad at the end of the 28-day period. Interview questions focused on perceptions of recovery progress and study procedures. Results: Symptom trajectories were variable across participants. Three main themes emerged from thematic analysis, including: (1) disruption of routines and activities, (2) injury management considerations, and (3) positive and negative influential factors (eg, school and coach support, timing of injury, and recovery expectations). Results highlighted nuances of recovery challenges that families specifically face and help emphasize the potential benefits of shared decision-making and where more guidance would be appreciated such as more specific self-management of symptoms and physical activity reintegration strategies. Conclusions: Study findings support a shared decision-making approach with the identified themes as potential topics to help consider social and environmental influences on recovery. The themes presented in the results could be topics emphasized during intake and follow-up visit processes to help guide plans of care and return-to-activity decisions.",80

We examine how mortality and individual-specific traumatic exposures at the time of the disaster affect mortality risks of survivors over the subsequent ten years, using data from Aceh, Indonesia, collected before and after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Across communities, the higher the percentage of individuals killed in the tsunami, the lower the mortality rate for adults over the subsequent decade. However, among older adults post-disaster mortality is elevated for males with poor post-tsunami psychosocial health and for females whose spouse died in the tsunami. Individual-specific tsunami exposures do not affect the mortality of younger adults within the ten-year time frame. Whereas positive mortality selection is evident for all adults, scarring is evident only for older adults and is large enough to substantively counteract the reductions in risk from positive mortality selection. The long-term impacts on mortality risks of exposure to disasters have not been analysed. Using data from Indonesia collected before and after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, this study examines the effects of the disaster on mortality risks of survivors over the subsequent ten years.",80
https://openalex.org/W4379508748,10.1177/00207640231177829,The longitudinal impact of war exposure on psychopathology in Syrian and Iraqi refugee youth,"Background: War and natural disasters lead to forced migration – and increased risk of adverse psychological outcomes – in approximately 1% of the global population. Though recent years have brought a greater understanding of the consequences of war exposure on mental health outcomes for refugee children, little is known about the longitudinal and developmental impact of these experiences on youth. Aims: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of direct exposure to war and/or combat on trajectories of symptoms related to anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Syrian and Iraqi refugee youth following resettlement. Prevalence of possible anxiety disorders and PTSD was also assessed. Method: Participants included accompanied refugee youth resettled in the state of Michigan in the U.S. ( n = 74). Youth filled out self-report measures of trauma exposure, anxiety symptoms, and PTSD symptoms upon arrival and 2 years later. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to assess the effect of war exposure over time. Results: Upon arrival, 38% screened positive for an anxiety disorder and 4.1% met diagnostic thresholds for PTSD. While war exposure did not predict changes to PTSD symptom trajectories ( p = .481), anxiety symptoms increased over time among children reporting war exposure ( B = 10.13, SE = 4.22, t = 2.40, p = .019). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that without appropriate interventions, anxiety- and trauma-related symptoms often do not decrease. Further, exposure to war trauma may lead to progressive worsening of symptoms. These findings suggest that assessing for type of trauma exposure, rather than focusing solely on migration status, may inform focused attention and interventions among trauma-exposed children resettling as refugees.",80

Thus, the present study assessed the correlates of symptoms that persisted at 4 months after an ED visit and, in particular, evaluated the associations between these symptoms and self-reported stress levels at ED admission and discharge. This study was a prospective observational investigation conducted in the ED of Bordeaux University Hospital that included patients admitted for minor trauma. All participants were contacted by phone 4 months after presentation at the ED to assess the occurrence of post-concussion-like symptoms (PCLS). A total of 193 patients completed the follow-up assessment at 4 months; 5.2% of the participants suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 24.5% suffered from PCLS. A multivariate analysis revealed an association between PCLS and stress level at discharge from the ED (odds ratios [OR]: 2.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10–7.40). The risk of PCLS at 4 months after an ED visit for a minor injury increased in association with the level of stress at discharge from the ED. These results may improve the quality of life for the millions of patients who experience a stressful injury event every year.",80

Little is known about response trajectories and predictors in intensive PTSD treatments. This study sought to identify different trajectories of symptom change among veterans who completed a 3-week CPT-based intensive PTSD treatment program and examined potential predictors of trajectory group membership. Four hundred fifty-two veterans completed the program. Demographics, PTSD and depression severity, negative posttrauma cognitions, and alcohol use were assessed at intake and evaluated as possible predictors of group membership. Group based trajectory modeling was used to determine distinct groups based on PTSD symptom trajectory over the course of treatment, as well as predictors of group membership. Four distinct treatment trajectories were identified: Fast responders (15.3%), steady responders (32.0%), partial responders (38.4%), and minimal responders (14.4%). Fast and steady responders reported substantial symptom reductions and dropped below the “probable PTSD” threshold, with fast responders achieving improvements after just one week of treatment. Partial responders experienced clinically significant reductions but remained above the “probable PTSD” threshold. Minimal responders reported the highest baseline PTSD symptoms and changed the least throughout treatment. Negative posttrauma cognitions as well as self-reported and clinician-rated PTSD symptom severity assessed at intake successfully predicted trajectory membership. The identified trajectories closely resemble findings in the limited existing literature on intensive PTSD treatment trajectories. Results suggest that some individuals may improve with even shorter interventions and others might benefit from additional treatment sessions. Overall, findings support the importance of evaluating individual- and group-level treatment responses.",80

Protective factors such as social support from family and friends may help to buffer the effects of adversity. Aims The association of violence exposure and emotional disorders was examined in Cape Town adolescents. Method A total of 1034 Grade 8 high school students participated from seven government co-educational schools in Cape Town, South Africa. Exposure to violence in the past 12 months and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, depressive and anxiety symptoms by the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale. Results Exposure to violence was associated with high scores on depressive (odds ratio (OR)=6.23, 95% CI 4.2–9.2), anxiety (OR=5.40, 95% CI 2.4–12.4) and PTSD symptoms (OR=8.93, 95% CI 2.9–27.2) and increased risk of self-harm (OR=5.72, 95% CI 1.2–25.9) adjusting for gender and social support. Conclusions We found that high exposure to violence was associated with high levels of emotional disorders in adolescents that was not buffered by social support. There is an urgent need for interventions to reduce exposure to violence in young people in this setting.",80

However, little is known regarding the effects of maternal sleep difficulties on parenting or about the mediational role of childbirth-related PTS symptoms in this association. The present study (pregnancy: T0; 1 month postpartum: T1; 3 months postpartum: T2) had two aims. The first one was to explore whether maternal sleep difficulties could contribute to the maintenance of PTS symptoms and whether PTS symptoms could contribute to the maintenance of maternal sleep difficulties. The second purpose was to explore, at 3 months (T2), the associations among childbirth-related PTS symptoms, maternal sleep difficulties, and the three dimensions of parenting stress [parental distress (PD), parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child] by examining the mediational role of both maternal sleep difficulties and childbirth-related PTS symptoms. Self-report questionnaires were administered to 95 women at different times (T0, T1, and T2). Mediational results confirmed the bidirectional effects between maternal sleep difficulties and PTS symptoms and their reciprocal role of maintenance of symptoms. Moreover, at 3 months postpartum (T2), sleep difficulties mediated the association between PTS symptoms and the three dimensions of maternal parenting stress, while PTS symptoms mediated the associations among maternal sleep difficulties, PD, and difficult child dimensions of parenting stress. The study contributes to the understanding of the maintenance factors of childbirth-related PTS symptoms and of the relationships among PTS symptoms, maternal sleep difficulties, and parenting stress.",80

Our objective was to examine whether acute stress symptoms measured 1-2 weeks post-stroke predicted the presence of post-traumatic stress symptoms measured 6-12 weeks later.Prospective within-groups study.Fifty four participants who completed a measure of acute stress disorder at 1-2 weeks following stroke (time 1) and 31 of these participants completed a measure of posttraumatic stress disorder 6-12 weeks later (time 2). Participants also completed measures of stroke severity, functional impairment, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, pre-morbid intelligence and pain across both time points.Some 22% met the criteria for ASD at baseline and of those, 62.5% went on to meet the criteria for PTSD at follow-up. Meanwhile two of the seven participants (28.6%) who met the criteria for PTSD at Time 2, did not meet the ASD criteria at Time 1 (so that PTSD developed subsequently). A hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that the presence of acute stress symptoms at baseline was predictive of post-traumatic stress symptoms at follow-up (R2 = .26, p < .01). Less severe stroke was correlated with higher levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms at Time 2 (rho = .42, p < .01).The results highlight the importance of early assessment and identification of acute stress symptoms in stroke survivors as a risk factor for subsequent PTSD. Both ASD and PTSD were prevalent and the presence of both disorders should be assessed.",80

In the current study the authors address this gap by examining the ways in which PTSD differs among young (ages 20–34), middle-aged (ages 35–64), and older (age 65+) adults with respect to past-year prevalence, nature of “worst” stressful experience ever experienced before the onset of PTSD, all traumatic experiences, symptom expression, psychiatric comorbidities, and mental health–related quality of life. Methods We analyzed Wave 2 data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, including adults with past-year diagnoses of PTSD (N = 1,715). Results The prevalence of past-year PTSD was significantly higher for young (4.3% [SE: 0.3]) and middle-aged (5.2% [SE: 0.2]) adults compared with older adults (2.6% [SE: 0.2]). Respondents in the three age groups differed with regard to their “worst” stressful experience ever experienced before the onset of PTSD and to all traumatic experiences. Older adults experienced significantly fewer traumatic experiences (mean: 5.2; SE: 0.2) compared with young (mean: 5.7; SE: 0.2) and middle-aged adults (mean: 6.4; SE: 0.1). Young and middle-aged adults had significantly greater symptom counts and greater odds of comorbid psychiatric disorders when compared with older adults. PTSD had similar effects on mental health–related quality of life across the adult lifespan. Conclusion Results highlight key differences in the characteristics of PTSD across the adult lifespan.

https://openalex.org/W3022800067,10.1002/cncr.32879,Symptom burden trajectories experienced by patients with brain tumors,"Background Survivors of childhood brain tumors experience persistent health concerns across their lifespan. In the current study, the authors evaluated changes in symptom burden over the course of 12 months using pediatric Patient‐Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. Methods Data from 202 survivors aged 8 to 21 years and 262 parents of survivors who were aged 5 to 21 years were analyzed. All completed a PROMIS Cognition short form and computerized adaptive tests of pediatric Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity Function, and Peer Relationships. Approximately one‐half of participants (223 participants: 97 survivors of childhood brain tumors and 126 parents) completed the 12‐month follow‐up. Linear mixed‐effects models evaluated group‐level symptoms over time. Cox proportional hazard models explored whether symptoms predicted survival, and latent class growth analysis investigated patterns of individual‐level symptom changes over time. Results Linear mixed‐effects models demonstrated that patient‐reported Cognition and parent‐reported Anxiety worsened over time. Latent class growth analysis results indicated that patient and parent reports diverged, both with regard to the number of classes identified and in the trends of these classes. Parents and patients reported similar patterns of depression over time. For the other areas, parents either were more likely to observe different patterns (Peer Relationships and Mobility) or less likely to observe different patterns (Upper Extremity Function, Cognition, Anxiety, and Fatigue). Baseline patient‐reported Mobility and Upper Extremity Function were found to be associated with survival. Conclusions Survivors of childhood brain tumors demonstrated different trajectory patterns of symptom burden. Along with baseline functioning status and days since treatment, patient‐reported Mobility and Upper Extremity Function were associated with survival, suggesting a possible role for patient‐reported outcomes in clinical care, especially individualized, tailored assessments such as PROMIS.",80
https://openalex.org/W2907019276,,The Influence of Pain on the Development of PTSD Across the Acute Post Trauma Period,"Exposure to potentially traumatic events is fairly common among US adults, yet only a small fraction develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear, however, why some individuals develop PTSD and others do not. Higher pain after a traumatic injury has been associated with higher PTSD symptomology and may be a risk factor for developing PTSD. However, few studies have examined symptoms during the period immediately after a trauma to determine how they relate to PTSD outcome. The goal of this study was to identify trajectories of pain throughout the first month after a traumatic injury and examine their relation to PTSD symptoms at 1 month. A sample of (n = 88) individuals who had experienced a traumatic injury assessed their pain through daily mobile assessments for the first month after injury. Daily mobile assessments consisted of self-report surveys sent to the participants’ mobile device. A follow-up interview was conducted at 1 month after injury to assess PTSD symptomology. Using growth mixture modeling, three trajectories of pain were identified: low pain, decreasing pain, and persistent high pain. Membership to the low pain group was associated with lower PTSD, depression and disability symptoms at 1 month after injury. Membership to the high pain group was associated with higher levels of PTSD, depression and disability symptoms at 1 month. These results demonstrate that there are distinct trajectories of pain after a traumatic injury and these trajectories may relate to later symptoms of psychopathology.",80

The current study aimed to identify developmental trajectories of PTSS in childhood and to examine predictors of symptom presentation in 1,178 children from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) studies, a consortium of studies focusing on the causes and effects of child maltreatment. Most children had a history of documented reports with Child Protective Services (CPS) and all were identified as living in high‐risk environments. Using group‐based trajectory modeling, 3 unique developmental trajectories were identified: Resilient, Clinical‐Improving (PTSS in the clinical range at baseline then declining over time), and Borderline‐Stable (chronically subclinical PTSS). Children in the Clinical‐Improving group were more likely than children in the Resilient group to have reports of physical abuse (RRR = 1.76), emotional abuse (RRR = 2.55), neglect (RRR = 1.57), and exposure to violence at home and in the community (RRR = 1.04). Children in the Borderline‐Stable group were more likely than children in the Resilient group to have a CPS history of neglect (RRR = 2.44) and exposure to violence at home and in the community (RRR = 1.04). Many children living in high‐risk environments exhibit resilience to PTSS, but exposure to witnessed violence and neglect appear to put children at chronic risk for poor adjustment. These children may require more intensive, integrated clinical services that attend to multiple adverse experiences.",81

This secondary analysis investigated: a) the longitudinal analysis of the effect of perceived spiritual support (PSS; measured using PSSS-S2) on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS); and b) the effect of social support and Wave-1 PTSS results on Wave-2 PTSS among Hurricane-Katrina (H-K) volunteers. We hypothesized that, 1. The shortform PSSS-S2 would have an adequate one-dimensional structure in our H-K sample; 2. PSSS-S2 would be inversely related to Wave-2 PTSS, after controlling for Wave-1 PTSS and other disaster factors; and 3. Wave-2 perceived social support would be inversely related to Wave-2 PTSS. In 2005, researchers of universities the Deep South conducted a questionnaire survey on H-K volunteers, some of whom were also disaster victims (N = 542; age = 29.66 + 9.10, African American = 55%).

Robust Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to verify the single-item structure of PSSS-S2. Multiple regression analysis was employed using SPSS27. The Robust CFA results indicate good model fit. In our final regression model, Wave-1 PTSS (β = 0.527, p &lt; 0.001) and other H-K stressors (β = 0.154, p &lt; 0.035) were positively associated with Wave-2 PTSS. Being older, having experienced less PTSS in Wave-1, and perceiving higher rates of social support were negatively related with Wave-2 PTSS. The present study demonstrated the lasting nature of PTSS. The present study demonstrated the lasting nature of PTSS. The six-months follow-up is important because it was the time a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could be established for volunteers. Our findings underscore the importance of social support and perceived spiritual support in fending off the negative role of disaster-induced stressors [1].",81

In this study, we examined whether this ""healthy worker effect"" is relevant in postdisaster mental health by examining whether trauma-exposed employed individuals have lower postdisaster initial mental health problems and/or whether they recover faster than trauma-exposed unemployed individuals. We compared the course of postevent intrusion and avoidance reactions, anxiety, depression, and sleeping difficulties of employed residents (n = 291) and unemployed residents (n = 269) affected by a fireworks disaster in a residential area of Enschede, The Netherlands. Measurements took place at 2-3 weeks (T1), 18 months (T2), and 4 years (T3) postdisaster. We used linear mixed-effect models to examine the course of mental health problems. Employment status was relevant, to a degree, in posttrauma recovery; although affected employed residents had significantly lower levels of mental health problems (initially and over time) than the unemployed, ds = 0.41-0.72, the recovery rate was the same for both groups. At T1 (neglecting the DSM 1-month criterion), T2, and T3, the prevalence of probable posttraumatic stress disorder was 45.4%, 18.9%, and 11%, respectively, among employed individuals, and 70.1%, 32.5%, and 30% among unemployed individuals. We concluded that research into the mental health of disaster victims should take employment status into account. Regarding postdisaster care, unemployed individuals may need special attention; although they may recover at the same rate as employed individuals, they suffer from more severe mental health problems, even years after the disaster.",81

This study aimed to identify trajectories of birth-related PTSD; determine factors associated with each trajectory; and identify women more likely to develop birth-related PTSD. 226 women who had traumatic childbirth according to DSM-IV criterion A were drawn from a community sample of 950 women. Measures were taken of PTSD, affective symptoms, fear of childbirth and social support in pregnancy, 4–6 weeks and 6-months postpartum. Information on some obstetric and psychosocial factors were also prospectively obtained. Four trajectories were identified: resilience (61.9%), recovery (18.5%), chronic-PTSD (13.7%) and delayed-PTSD (5.8%). Resilience was consistently distinguished from other PTSD trajectories by less affective symptoms at 4–6 weeks postpartum. Poor satisfaction with health professionals was associated with chronic-PTSD and delayed-PTSD. When affective symptoms at 4–6 weeks postpartum were removed from the model, less social support and higher fear of childbirth 4–6 weeks after birth predicted chronic and recovery trajectories; whereas experience of further trauma and low levels of satisfaction with health professionals were predictive of chronic-PTSD and delayed-PTSD, compared to resilience. Additional variables associated with different trajectories included antenatal affective symptoms, caesarean-section, preterm birth and receiving professional help. Use of self-report measures, use of DSM-IV criteria for PTSD diagnosis, and no follow-up beyond six months are the main limitations of this study. Identified factors may inform preventive and treatment interventions for women with traumatic birth experiences.",81

It is essential to understand children’s health needs during disasters as they are a particularly vulnerable population. The objective of this study was to evaluate pediatric disease burden after Hurricane Harvey compared to the preceding month and the same period in the previous year to inform pediatric disaster preparedness.Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients seen at pediatric emergency departments (ED) and urgent care centers (UCC) 30 days before (late summer) and after (early fall) the hurricane and from the same time period in 2016. We collected demographic information and the first five discharge diagnoses from a network of EDs and UCCs affiliated with a quaternary care children’s hospital in Houston, Texas. We calculated the odds of disease outcomes during various timeframes using binary logistic regression modeling.Results: There were 20,571 (median age: 3.5 years, 48.1% female) and 18,943 (median age: 3.5 years, 47.3% female) patients in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Inpatient admission rates from the ED a month after Harvey were 20.5%, compared to 25.3% in the same period in 2016 (P&lt;0.001). In both years, asthma and other respiratory illnesses increased from late summer to early fall. After controlling for these seasonal trends, the following diseases were more commonly seen after the hurricane: toxicological emergencies (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.61, 95% [confidence interval] CI, 1.35-5.05); trauma (aOR: 1.42, 95% CI, 1.32-1.53); and dermatological complaints (aOR: 1.34, 95% CI, 1.23-1.46).Conclusion: We observed increases in rashes, trauma, and toxicological diagnoses in children after a major flood. These findings highlight the need for more medication resources and public health and education measures focused on pediatric disaster preparedness and management.",81

Methods: Participants ( N = 248) completed an electronic survey asking questions about their military experiences, physical and mental health, and substance use. Childhood trauma and combat exposure were examined jointly in regression models, controlling for age, marital satisfaction, and number of deployments. Results: Childhood trauma was associated with current drug use (trend level, odds ratio [OR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97, 2.14; P = .072) in the main effect model; however, there was not a significant interaction with combat. Combat exposure had a significant interaction with childhood trauma on alcohol problems ( b = −0.56, 95% CI: −1.12, −0.01; P = .048), FHD ( b = −0.27, 95% CI: −0.47, −0.08; P = .007), and lifetime drug use (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.04; P = .035). There were no associations with either of the trauma measures and current cigarette smoking. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that childhood and combat trauma have differential effects on alcohol use, such that combat trauma may not add to the effect on alcohol use in those with greater child maltreatment but may contribute to greater alcohol use among those with low child maltreatment. As expected, childhood and combat trauma had synergistic effects on lifetime drug use. Screening for multiple types of trauma prior to enlistment and/or deployment may help to identify at-risk individuals and allow time for early intervention to prevent future adverse outcomes.",81

No long‐term studies have been conducted on one highly exposed group, WTC tower evacuees. Methods The study sample included 7,695 adult civilians in the WTC Health Registry. Logistic regression was used to examine the odds of PTSD and BD in 1,946 towers evacuees compared to 5,749 others in nearby buildings or on the street. Results WTC tower survivors were at increased risk for PTSD and BD compared to the others. Infrastructure and behavioral barriers experienced during evacuation were significantly associated with PTSD. Conclusions WTC tower evacuees are at increased risk for PTSD and BD. Understanding the effects of disaster‐related evacuation barriers on the long‐term mental health status of survivors can help in the planning of continuing post‐disaster treatment. Am. J. Ind.

https://openalex.org/W2806559663,10.1016/j.ejtd.2018.06.001,"Exploration of relationship between parental distress, family functioning and post-traumatic symptoms in children","We investigated the links between peritraumatic distress in children and in their parents following a potentially traumatic event, focusing specifically on the role that parents and family functioning can play in the development and maintenance of post-traumatic disorders in children. To this end, we examined a population of 41 children (aged 8 and above), and their parents, who had been admitted to the emergency room of a pediatric hospital due to an accident. The design included a two-step assessment: immediate reactions (in the hours following the event) and delayed reactions (5–8 weeks after the event). We used six questionnaires to assess reactions. The results indicated a statistically significant positive correlation between the intensity of the peri-traumatic distress of the parents and the level of post-traumatic symptoms observed later (5 to 8 weeks after the event) in the questionnaires administered to the children. Regarding educational practices, differences appear to be linked to maternal education practice and to the severity of child's symptomatology. Finally, a link has been established between changes within the family dynamic after a potentially traumatic event and the severity of child's posttraumatic symptoms. This study showed the extent to which the parents’ initial reactions can be decisive in the outcome for a child who has experienced a potentially traumatic event. The study highlights the importance of assessing parental responses as well as paying attention to the children when they arrive in a pediatric emergency room. The results are relevant for prevention and treatment of PTSD in children, as the integration of this parental dimension early on in the process may lead to improved identification of which young patients are at risk of developing post-traumatic symptomatology.",82

In this follow-up study, we examined whether the patterns of symptomatology have changed over time.Using data on 56 symptoms that was collected in 2000-2003 (wave 1) and 2011-2012 (wave 2) from an Australian cohort of Gulf War veterans (veterans) and a military comparison group, exploratory factor analysis was conducted and Tucker's Congruence Coefficient (TCC) was used to determine factor structure similarity across study groups and waves.The results showed that the 3 factors observed at wave 1 were still present at wave 2, and factor structures across study groups and study waves were fairly similar, with TCC ranging 0.86-0.92. Veterans consistently reported more symptoms across all 3 factors. Veterans' symptomatology specific to psychophysiological distress increased between waves 1 and 2 (ratio of means 1.15; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25) but psychophysiological distress symptomatology was constant in the comparison group (ratio of means 0.97; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.06). Somatic and arthroneuromuscular distress symptomatology significantly increased over time for both study groups, although at a similar rate.While the symptom groupings (measured by the 3 factors) remained unchanged at 10 years of follow-up, and remained comparable between Gulf War and comparison group, symptomatology continued to be elevated in Gulf War veterans than in the comparison group, and was most evident for psychophysiological distress.",82

Data were taken from four mental health surveys carried out in Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2010, 2011 and 2014.Among 4265 participants, after adjusting for military and social-demographic covariates, perceiving that deployment had a negative impact on intimate relationships and children was associated with psychological distress, and traumatic stress symptoms. Military personnel who reported being in danger of being injured or killed during deployment, were more likely to report a perceived negative effect of deployment on their intimate relationships. Reservists were less likely to report a perceived negative impact of deployment on their children compared with regulars. Military personnel who themselves planned to separate from their partner were more likely to report psychological distress, and stressors at home. Perceived insufficient support from the Ministry of Defence was associated with poor mental health, and holding a junior rank.Deployed UK military personnel with symptoms of psychological distress, who experienced stressors at home, were especially likely to perceive that their family were inadequately supported by the military. Those planning to separate from their partner were at increased risk of suffering with mental health problems while deployed.",82

However, both men and women experience SA. Research shows that not all individuals experience the negative impacts of SA in the same way. The ability to buffer the negative effects of SA may lie in specific protective factors that determine resilience. Resilience scales used in adult populations have not been validated for use in SA samples. The purpose of the present study was to replicate the factor structure of a resilience scale, the Scale of Protective Factors (SPF), in a sample of emerging adults ( n = 571) and to validate the replicated model on a subsample of the participants who reported SA ( n = 173). Additionally, we sought to examine gender differences in mental health outcomes including depression and anxiety, and the availability of protective factors that determine resilience among those participants who reported experiencing SA ( n = 173) as compared to other forms of traumatic stress ( n = 132). The SPF achieved good model fit in the larger emerging adult sample and adequate model fit was achieved in the SA subsample. Results indicated significant gender differences in mental health outcomes with η 2 ranging between .03 and .21. Implications and future directions are discussed.",82

In our sample, 35.82% reported clinically significant symptoms of PTSD, with a higher prevalence for girls and young women. They also had consistently higher scores than boys and young men on every subscale. Participants with working parents had consistently higher scores across all the subscales than participants whose parents did not work.

Current PTSD assessment practices are not fully sensitive to the complex symptomatic picture observed among individuals exposed to ongoing stress and are therefore limited for use in these situations. The current survey aimed to portray the posttraumatic characteristics most salient to ongoing exposure to political conflict. A questionnaire enquiring about various aspects of the posttraumatic consequences of ongoing exposure to political conflict as compared with those associated with a single exposure to trauma was disseminated to therapists throughout the country. Participants were asked to rank 75 posttraumatic characteristics for their relevance to each trauma type (about the symptom frequency and severity) and item mean scores were compared. The sample consisted of 66 responses valid for analysis. Our findings pinpoint some of the posttraumatic characteristics most salient to ongoing exposure to political conflict and highlight the complexity of the posttraumatic picture observed in these situations. Incorporating these in post trauma assessment tools will allow for the development of standardized, reliable definitions, which in turn will allow for more accurate diagnosis and more effective treatment protocols.",82

A comprehensive way to understand posttrauma psychopathology is through symptom trajectories. The study aimed to look at the developmental courses of PTSD and depression symptoms in the initial months posttrauma, and their interrelationship in children and adolescents by utilizing advanced group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM). Methods: Two-hundred-and-seventeen children and adolescents aged between eight and 17 exposed to single-event trauma were included in the study. Their PTSD and depression symptoms were measured at two weeks, two months and nine months, with further psychological variables measures at the two-week assessment. Results: The GBTM modeling yielded a three-group model for PTSD and a three-group model for depression. All participants’ PTSD symptoms reduced to non-clinical level by nine months: participants were observed to be resilient (42.4%) or to be able to recover within two months (35.6%), while 21.9% experienced high level PTSD symptoms but recovered in nine months time. The depression trajectories described a chronic non-recovery depression group (20.1%) and two mild symptom groups (45.9%, 34.0%). Further analysis showed high synchronicity between PTSS and depression groups but predictor analysis revealed disparate predictors. Perievent panic (CPP), appraisal (CPTCI), rumination and thought suppression at week two predicted slow recovery from PTSS, while pre-trauma wellbeing (CPAS), post-trauma anxiety (SCAS) and appraisal (CPTCI) predicted chronic depression. Conclusions: Posttrauma depression was more persisting than PTSD symptoms at nine months in the sampled population. Cognitive appraisal may be central to explaining PTSD-depression comorbidity.",82

Longitudinal associations involving posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), relatively mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), and neurocognitive compromise are poorly understood, especially with regard to long-term outcomes, and rigorous research is necessary to better understand the corresponding relationships. The objective of this study was to examine short-term and long-term (&gt;5 years) longitudinal associations among PTSD, neurocognitive performance, and TBI following military deployment. Methods: In this prospective study, N =315 U.S. Army soldiers were assessed at military installations before (2003–2005) and after (2004–2006) an index deployment to the Iraq War, and again an average of 7.6 years later (2010–2014) as a nationally dispersed cohort of active duty soldiers, reservists, and veterans. Thus, the study design allowed for two measurement intervals over which to examine changes. All assessments included the PTSD Checklist, civilian version, and individually-administered performance-based neurocognitive tests. TBI history was derived from clinical interview. Results: Autoregressive analyses indicated that visual reproduction scores were inversely related to subsequent PTSD symptom severity at subsequent assessments. Conversely, increases in PTSD symptom severity over each measurement interval were associated with poorer verbal and/or visual recall at the end of each interval, and less efficient reaction time at post-deployment. TBI, primarily mild in this sample, was associated with adverse PTSD symptom outcomes at both post-deployment and long-term follow-up. Conclusions: These results suggest longitudinal relationships among PTSD symptoms, TBI, and neurocognitive decrements may contribute to sustained emotional and neurocognitive symptoms over time.

We examined the relationship between acute stress response to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings and prior direct and indirect media-based exposure to three collective traumatic events: the September 11, 2001 (9/11) terrorist attacks, Superstorm Sandy, and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Representative samples of residents of metropolitan Boston (n = 846) and New York City (n = 941) completed Internet-based surveys shortly after the Boston Marathon bombings. Cumulative direct exposure and indirect exposure to prior community trauma and acute stress symptoms were assessed. Acute stress levels did not differ between Boston and New York metropolitan residents. Cumulative direct and indirect, live-media-based exposure to 9/11, Superstorm Sandy, and the Sandy Hook shooting were positively associated with acute stress responses in the covariate-adjusted model. People who experience multiple community-based traumas may be sensitized to the negative impact of subsequent events, especially in communities previously exposed to similar disasters.",82

The mental health of refugee children is often associated with the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in their caregivers. Despite the potential for refugee caregivers' PTSD to affect child mental health, little evidence exists concerning the underlying mechanisms of this association. This study tested the effect of refugee caregivers' previous trauma and levels of ongoing stressors on current PTSD, and in turn how this influences parenting behaviour and consequent child psychological health.This cohort study recruited participants from the Building a New Life in Australia study, a population-based prospective cohort study of refugees admitted to 11 sites in Australia between October, 2013, and February, 2014. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older and the principal or secondary applicant (ie, the refugee applicant within a migrating family unit) for a humanitarian visa awarded between May, 2013, and December, 2013. Primary caregiver PTSD and postmigration difficulties were assessed at Wave 1 (in 2013), and caregiver PTSD was reassessed at Wave 2 (in 2014). At Wave 3, between October, 2015, and February, 2016, primary caregivers repeated measures of trauma history, postmigration difficulties, probable PTSD, and harsh and warm parenting style, and completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for their child. We used path analysis to investigate temporal patterns in PTSD, trauma history, postmigration stressors, parenting style, and children's psychological difficulties.The current data comprised 411 primary caregivers who provided responses in relation to at least one child (660 children). 394 primary caregivers with 639 children had data on independent variables and were included in the final model. Path analyses revealed that caregivers' trauma history and postmigration difficulties were associated with greater subsequent PTSD, which in turn was associated with greater harsh parenting and in turn, higher levels of child conduct problems (β=0·049, p=0·0214), hyperactivity (β=0·044, p=0·0241), emotional symptoms (β=0·041, p=0·0218), and peer problems (β=0·007, p=0·047). There was also a direct path from primary caregiver PTSD to children's emotional problems (β=0·144, p=0·0001).PTSD in refugees is associated with harsh parenting styles, leading to adverse effects on their children's mental health. Programmes to enhance refugee children's mental health should account for PTSD in parents and caregivers, and the parenting behaviours that these children are exposed to.National Health and Medical Research Council.",82

Data from 83 Dutch veterans with PTSD attending treatment in a specialized institute were utilized. The effect of both prognostic factors was firstly investigated with repeated-measures analyses of variance using split-plot design, and subsequently with linear regression analyses. Regarding anger a greater decline in PTSD severity from pre-treatment to follow-up for high pre-treatment levels of anger compared to low levels of anger was found. Anger was also found to predict change in PTSD severity, but concerning the three separate PTSD symptom clusters anger only predicted change in the hyperarousal cluster. The interaction between pre-treatment PTSD severity and anger was furthermore found to predict change in PTSD severity, suggesting that higher pre-treatment anger was associated with better treatment responses as pre-treatment levels of PTSD severity decreased. With respect to avoidant coping no impact on treatment outcome was found. These results are inconsistent with the existing literature. This study stresses the importance of anger as a predictor of treatment outcome and is novel in suggesting its positive impact, raising questions about the previously assumed role of this prognostic factor. It is discussed how the findings of this research may help improve the screening and treatment process, however, replication is self-evidently required.",83

In recent years, several trauma-focused therapies (TFTs), including cognitive restructuring (CR), prolonged exposure (PE), and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) have been studied and found to be safe and effective in reducing PTSD symptoms in individuals with psychosis. However, studies were conducted in different countries, with varying inclusion criteria, therapy duration, control groups, and trial outcomes. RE.PROCESS will be the first study to compare the impact of CR, PE and EMDR with a waiting list control condition within the same context.Methods and analysis: This is the protocol of a pragmatic, single-blind, multicentre, superiority randomized controlled trial, in which CR, PE, and EMDR are compared to a waiting list control condition for TFT (WL) in a naturalistic treatment setting. Inclusion criteria are: Age ≥ 16 years; meeting full DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), with a total CAPS score ≥ 23; and a psychotic disorder in the schizophrenia spectrum confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5). Participants (N = 200) will be randomly allocated to 16 sessions of one of the TFTs or WL, in addition to receiving treatment as usual (TAU) for psychosis. The primary objective is to compare the effects of CR, PE, and EMDR to WL on researcher-rated severity of PTSD symptoms over time from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Secondary objectives are to examine these effects at the separate time-points (i.e. mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up) and to test the effects for clinician-rated presence of PTSD diagnosis, and self-rated severity of (complex) PTSD symptoms.Discussion: This is the first RCT to directly compare the effects of CR, PE and EMDR within the same context to TAU on PTSD symptoms in individuals with psychosis and PTSD. Secondary effects on clinical and functional outcomes will be investigated both directly after therapy and long-term.Trial registration: ISRCTN, ISRCTN56150327.

Understanding the factors that contribute to PTSD symptoms may lead to improved clinical management of PTSD and TBI. This study examines acute predictors of self-reported PTSD symptoms after TBI in military service members. Method Participants included 210 U.S. military service members (Age: M = 33.9 years, SD = 10.2) without injury (n = 86), or with history of uncomplicated mild TBI (n = 56), complicated mild, moderate, or severe TBI (n = 43), or bodily injury (n = 25) assessed at 0–8 months and ≥ 2 years post-injury. At both assessments, participants completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C), Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, Alcohol Use Disorder Checklist, Combat Exposure Scale, and TBI Quality of Life and passed symptom validity tests. Stepwise linear regression included 26 potential predictors (demographics, injury characteristics, military characteristics, and self-report measures at baseline) of PCL-C Total at follow-up. Results In this model, (F(4,188) = 68.0; p &amp;lt; .001; R2 = .591), baseline PCL-C (R2Δ = .52) was the main predictor of follow-up PCL-C Total, followed by Cognitive Concerns (R2Δ = .04), number of deployments (R2Δ = .01), and injury severity (R2Δ = .02). When baseline PCL-C was excluded as a predictor, somatosensory symptoms (R2Δ = .361), Emotional/Behavioral Dyscontrol (R2Δ = .067), Sleep (R2Δ = .033), Combat Exposure (R2Δ = .024), and Cognitive Concerns (R2Δ = .017) predicted follow-up PCL-C (F(5,187) = 37.7; p &amp;lt; .001; R2 = .502). Semipartial correlations revealed that most of the explained variance was shared among self-report predictors. Conclusion Findings suggest acute psychological distress impacts future PTSD symptomatology, whereas TBI characteristics, such as TBI severity and number of TBIs, have minimal influence.",83

Through an empirical analysis, the relevance of the occurrence of disasters such as the one produced by the Mexico City earthquake of September 19, 2017, and its relationship to the meaning of urban resilience is addressed. Since the 100 Resilient Cities program launch in 2013, several cities, including Mexico City, have adopted diverse strategies to build and become more resilient to physical, social, and economic shocks and stresses. Nonetheless, the degree of success of such strategies expressed in everyday life within the cities, regardless of what the official documents report, reveals highly heterogeneous results. In the case of Mexico City, it is evident that the appropriate strategy for attaining the desired outcome of becoming a Resilient City has not been successful. Despite setting the goal of advancing disaster risk reduction through urban and regional planning, the impact of the earthquake of September 19, 2017, proved otherwise.",83

The sample consisted of 269 patients (70.6% male; Mage = 53.21) admitted for inpatient rehabilitation to SCI rehabilitation centers.PTSS were measured at one and six months after injury using the Impact of Event Scale-6.Latent change score modelling revealed no average change in PTSS in the sample, but significant variability in the individual symptom courses. Reliable change index analyses suggest that among individuals with an initial PTSS severity of clinical concern (n = 65), only 27.7% showed clinically significant decreases over time. Predictors explained 34% of the variance in PTSS change. Loss appraisals (β = .30, p < .001) and cause of injury (β = .16, p = .018) emerged as unique predictors.Clinically elevated PTSS one month after SCI typically remain across the following months highlighting the need for early screening and intervention. Low loss appraisals were related to decreases in symptom severity and might therefore be a suitable intervention target for reducing PTSS after SCI.",83

It is unknown what impact childhood trauma may have on the early trajectory of serious mental illness (SMI). The purpose of this article is to estimate the baseline prevalence, perceived impact, and duration of trauma that occurred before the age of 18 years in youth at risk for SMI using a transdiagnostic approach. This study included 243 youths, ages 12 to 25 years (42 healthy controls, 43 non–help-seeking individuals [stage 0], 52 help-seeking youth experiencing distress and possibly mild symptoms of anxiety or depression [stage1a], and 108 youth demonstrating attenuated symptoms of an SMI such as bipolar disorder or psychosis [stage 1b]). Participants completed an adapted version of the Childhood Trauma and Abuse scale. There were high frequencies of reported trauma across all stages. Symptomatic individuals experienced more trauma and bullying. Stage 1b individuals reported more physical abuse. Stage 1b also indicated psychological bullying to have a longer duration and impact on their lives. Future work should aim to clarify the complex interrelations between trauma and risk of SMI.",83

The study examines posttraumatic growth (PTG) among women survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA), looking at the relation of PTG to the women's cognitive strategies (past self-blame, self-forgiveness, perception of control and hope), resilience and PTS.Self-report questionnaires were completed by 100 women survivors of CSA.Findings show that the main contributors to PTG were demographic-familial variables (birth order and number of siblings) and cognitive strategies (self-blame and hope).The relationship between resilience and PTG was curvilinear: The highest levels of PTG occurred when resilience levels were moderate. Variance in PTG was also explained by an interaction between resilience and PTS.Cognitive strategies and familial variables can contribute to PTG. The complex relations between PTG, resilience and PTS might help professionals better understand different trajectories of adjustment among trauma survivors. (PsycINFO Database Record",83

We performed multiple linear regression analyses to examine factors associated with the children's self-reported QoL.KIDSCREEN-27.The children's self-reported QoL was positively associated with the ill parent's self-reported physical health, the children's self-reported social skills, the degree to which other adults took over the ill parent's responsibilities, provision of sibling care, provision of health care for the ill parent and positive outcome of caregiving. The children's QoL was negatively associated with the children's self-reported responsibilities due to parental illness, provision of emotional care for the ill parent, negative outcomes of caregiving and external locus of control. The model explained 63% of the variance (adjusted R2 ) in children's total QoL.Sampling bias may have occurred during recruitment.The findings suggest factors of importance for the children's QoL. Clinicians should assess whether an ill parent's physical health may influence negatively on their ability to perform daily responsibilities at home and care for their children, and clinicians can use children's self-reported QoL to identify children who are most negatively affected.",83

This study sought to understand and predict long-term PTSD symptom course among a nationwide sample of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom veterans enrolled in Veterans Health Administration services. We assessed PTSD symptoms at 4 time points over approximately 4.5 years (M = 55.11 months, SD = 6.89). Participants (N = 1,353) with and without probable PTSD were sampled at a 3:1 ratio, and male and female veterans were sampled at a 1:1 ratio to fully explore the heterogeneity of PTSD symptom course and the effect of sex on symptom course. By coding time as years since index trauma, we estimated the course of PTSD symptoms over 20 years. Results indicate symptom course is most appropriately characterized by substantial heterogeneity. On average, veterans experienced initial PTSD symptom severity above the diagnostic threshold following trauma exposure, which was initially stable over time and later began to gradually improve. Although results indicate symptoms eventually began to decline, this effect was gradual; most participants continued to meet or exceed the PTSD provisional diagnostic threshold long after trauma exposure. We identified several predictors and correlates of symptom course, including Hispanic ethnicity, postdeployment social support, and co-occurring psychopathology. Results highlight the heterogeneous nature of PTSD symptom course following trauma exposure and the urgency of the need to ensure access to evidence-based care and to improve available treatments.

For the first time, this study evaluated: 1) the effect of chronic exposure to effort-reward imbalance over 5years on the prevalence of high psychological distress among men and women, and 2) the persistence of this effect over time.Overall, 1747 white-collar workers from three public organizations participated in a prospective study. Psychological distress and effort-reward imbalance were measured using validated questionnaires at baseline, and at 3- and 5-year follow-ups. Prevalence ratios (PRs) of high psychological distress were estimated using log-binomial regression according to baseline and repeated exposure.Compared to unexposed workers, those with repeated exposure to effort-reward imbalance had a higher prevalence of high psychological distress. Workers exposed only at some time-points also had a higher prevalence. The deleterious effect of repeated exposure observed at the 3-year follow-up persisted at the 5-year follow-up among women (PR=2.48 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.97-3.11) and men (PR=1.91 95% CI 1.20-3.04). These effects were greater than those found using a single baseline measurement.The current study supported a deleterious effect of repeated exposure to effort-reward imbalance on psychological distress, and a lack of adaptation to these effects over time among men and women. Since psychological distress may later lead to severe mental problems, current results highlight the need to consider exposure to these adverse work factors in primary and secondary preventions aimed at reducing mental health problems at work.",83

However, due to the rareness of this population, there are no studies that have examined TGH individuals whose fathers were also victims of war-related trauma and captivity. This prospective study aimed to assess the role of parents' Holocaust background, fathers' posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and adult offspring's anxiety sensitivity (AS) in adult offspring's PTSS and psychiatric symptomatology. A sample of 123 Israeli father-child dyads (42 TGH and 71 non-TGH), that included 80 former prisoners of war (ex-POWs) dyads and a comparison group of 44 veteran dyads, completed AS, PTSS and psychiatric symptomatology self-report measures. Fathers were assessed 17 years following the Yom Kippur War (T1: 2008) while offspring took part in T2 (2013-2014). Surprisingly, results show that TGH participants reported lower levels of PTSS and psychiatric symptomatology than non-TGH participants, regardless of their fathers' captivity status. Interestingly, a moderated mediation analysis indicated that offspring's AS mediated the association between Holocaust background and participants' PTSS and psychiatric symptomatology, only among ex-POWs' offspring. This study provides evidence for relatively lower levels of PTSS and psychiatric symptomatology among TGH individuals whose fathers were war veterans. Ex-POWs' adult offspring who are grandchildren of Holocaust survivors reported lower levels of AS that was related to lower levels of PTSS and psychiatric symptomatology.",83

Methods We analyzed 6 waves of data from a 12-year panel using latent class growth models and multinomial logistic regression. Results We identified 4 groups of people experiencing different trajectories of depressive symptoms. The groups differed on baseline characteristics (gender, age, education, income, race), history of diagnosed depression, and initial level of depressive symptoms. The group with the highest levels of depressive symptoms reported greater levels of peri-traumatic stress exposure to Hurricane Sandy. Discussion Depressive symptoms increased as a function of the Great Recession, but exposure to Hurricane Sandy was not associated with subsequent increases in depressive symptoms for any of the 4 groups. People who consistently experienced high levels of depressive symptoms over time reported the highest levels of peri-traumatic stress during Hurricane Sandy. Findings highlight the importance of accounting for historical trends when studying the effects of disaster, identify people likely to be at risk during a disaster, and provide novel information about the causal relationship between exposure to disaster and depressive symptoms.",84

A convenience sample of 90 men who sought asylum from Eritrea and Sudan and presented at the Open-Clinic in Tel-Aviv, Israel, participated in the study. Participants completed measures assessing exposure to traumatic events, perceived social support and PTSD symptoms in their native language. The majority of participants had been exposed to traumatic events. Lack of shelter, ill health without access to medical care, imprisonment and torture were most prevalent. Perceived social support was associated with lower PTSD symptoms only among those who reported low exposure to traumatic events. Among asylees who reported high exposure to traumatic events, social support did not affect the association between exposure to traumatic events and PTSD symptoms. Our findings show that perceived social support serves as a significant moderator in the relationship between exposure to traumatic events and PTSD symptoms among asylum seekers, depending on the severity of exposure to traumatic events. The complex relationship between protective factors such as perceived social support, exposure to trauma and mental health should inform mental health services for forced migrants.",84

Methods: Data was collected in the context of an acute early rehabilitation setting of a trauma centre. A brief neuropsychological assessment was carried out for 348 patients within a month following their trauma. Results: Length of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) was the best predictor of behavioural, memory and executive function variables within a month post TBI. The odds of being agitated, labile, irritable and disinhibited at one month post trauma were almost six times higher for those with PTA that lasted more than 7 days compared to those with a PTA of less than 24 hours. Also, the odds of having a higher mental manipulation score (less significant executive function impairment) were almost two times lower for those with frontal lesions, and three to six times lower for those with PTA of more than 24 hours. In addition, TBI severity, education and age were considered good predictors of some aspects of neuropsychological outcome. Conclusion: This model may help clinicians and administrators recognize the probable post-traumatic deficits as quickly as possible and to plan interventions as well as post-acute discharge orientation accordingly and early on.",84

Method: Participants were identified from electronic medical records from 1995 to 2008 and data were collected from 2006 to 2008. Participants were primarily matched on total body surface area burned and gender, and as close as possible on age at time of burn and number of years postburn. Pediatric burn survivors completed a semistructured clinical interview, the Missouri Assessment of Genetics Interview for Children-PTSD section, which is based on criteria from the DSM-IV for evaluating lifetime PTSD. Results: There were 183 participants in the study, and from this sample 85 matched pairs were identified. Most were 5 years postburn. The prevalence of PTSD at the time of follow-up was 8.24% (7 of 85) for the ASD group and 4.71% (4 of 85) for the non-ASD comparison group. No significant differences were found between these groups at P value ≥ .05. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine if prior ASD diagnosis, burn size, gender, ethnicity, age at time of study participation, and number of years postburn predicted subsequent PTSD. None of the variables were significant predictors. Conclusions: The prevalence of PTSD was similar in children who had ASD symptoms and those without ASD symptoms. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD was lower than reported in other studies. A possible explanation for this finding is that children received timely pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy during their acute hospitalization.",84

Parents play a prominent role in the likelihood of child mental health outcomes after a weather-related disaster. This study aimed to examine the relationship between parent risk factors and children's psychological well-being post Hurricane Harvey.Parents (n = 140) completed a survey that measured hurricane exposure, parental depression and anxiety, parenting behaviors, and assistance given and received during or after Hurricane Harvey. Additionally, parents were asked to complete questionnaires assessing one of their children's post-disaster psychosocial functioning and distress.Results indicated that heightened parent anxiety was significantly associated with an increased risk for emotional symptoms, conduct problems, and hyperactivity-inattention symptoms in children. Additionally, inconsistency in parental discipline was significantly associated with an increased risk of child conduct problems. Further, higher numbers of assistance types received by parents-a proxy indicator of resource loss-was associated with higher child emotional distress scores.Broader systems-level interventions that address parents' physical and emotional needs may help mitigate maladaptive reactions in children and facilitate greater post-disaster psychosocial adjustment.",84

Self-disgust is feeling repugnance for aspects of the self and studies have supported its association with borderline features. This study aimed to identify different trajectories of the development of borderline features in adolescents over 12 months and test the longitudinal impact of self-disgust and gender. Participants were 158 adolescents (n = 110 girls) with a mean of 15.44 years (SD = 0.79), assessed in three moments with a six-month interval. Gender differences were found on borderline features and similar stable trajectories were exhibited for the total sample, boys and girls. Adolescents with higher and lower borderline features presented opposite trajectories: while the lower group decreased borderline features over time, the higher group increased. A latent growth model with the total sample revealed heterogeneity in basal levels and a relatively homogeneity on growth rates of borderline features. Self-disgust feelings presented a significant effect on basal levels and growth rates indicating that it might influence the developmental trajectory of borderline features. These findings highlight the importance to address self-disgust when dealing with borderline features in youth since it seems to be a risk factor.",84

A longitudinal cohort study was conducted with 105 individuals with moderate-to-severe TBI admitted to a trauma referral center in 2005–2007. Demographics and injury-related factors were extracted from medical records. At the one-, two- and five-year follow-ups, community integration was measured by the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ). A hierarchical linear model (HLM) examined whether longitudinal trajectories of community integration could be predicted by: time, sex, age, relationship status, education, employment status, occupation, acute Glasgow Coma Scale score, cause of injury, days in post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), computed tomography Marshall Score, and Injury Severity Score. CIQ scores improved across the three time-points (p<0.001). Additionally, higher trajectories of community integration were predicted by being single at the time of injury (p<.001), higher level of education (p=0.006), employment (p<0.001), and a shorter length of PTA (p<0.001). In a follow-up HLM with interaction terms, time*PTA was statistically significant (p<0.001), suggesting that participants with longer PTA increased in community integration more rapidly than those with shorter PTA. The longitudinal course of community integration described in this study may help rehabilitation professionals to plan more extensive follow-ups and targeted rehabilitation programs in the early stage of recovery for patients with specific demographic and injury characteristics.",84

Siblings (N = 229; 42% of eligible/approached; 53% identifying as female; 68% identifying as non-Hispanic White) completed the Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale. Caregivers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and growth mixture modeling (GMM) identified PTSS patterns across time.Fit statistics supported models with three to five PTSS trajectories. The three-class LCGA model included a large mild PTSS group (61%), a moderate PTSS group (35%), and a small (4%) stable severe PTSS group. The four-class LCGA and three- and four-class GMM included groups improving from moderate to mild PTSS (7-21%) and worsening to moderate PTSS across time (12-17%). Across models, siblings with mild PTSS had fewer caregiver-reported emotional and behavioral difficulties on the SDQ.A large group of siblings of children with cancer demonstrate resiliency, however, substantial subsets experience patterns of PTSS that include levels in the moderate-to-severe range during the first two years post-diagnosis. Future research should examine these patterns in more diverse/representative samples and identify factors associated with increasing and sustained severe PTSS to inform intervention targets and reduce cancer-related burden on families.",84

This study examined correlates of negative appraisals in relation to trauma exposure and their relationship to posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in 414 Sri Lankan adolescents, aged 12 to 16, living in areas impacted in varying degrees by the 2004 tsunami. In 2008, participants completed measures of negative appraisals, lifetime traumatic events, posttraumatic stress symptoms, internalizing symptoms, ongoing adversity, and social support. The majority (70 %) of the participants reported multiple traumatic events; 25 % met DSM-IV criteria for full or partial PTSD. Adolescents who had experienced more severe events, abusive events, greater cumulative trauma, or greater current adversity reported more negative appraisals. In regression analyses controlling for known risk factors such as female gender, cumulative trauma, ongoing adversity, and low social support, negative appraisals were the best predictor of PTSS, explaining 22 % of the variance. This relationship appeared specific to PTSS, as negative appraisals did not predict internalizing symptoms. Findings confirm the link between negative cognitions concerning traumatic events and persistent PTSS in adolescents, but longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether appraisals contribute to symptom maintenance over time.",84

The present study investigated the relationship of prospectively measured plasma GABA levels with psychopathology symptoms in military deployed to Afghanistan at risk for developing psychopathology following trauma exposure during deployment, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Plasma GABA levels were measured in military personnel (N=731) one month prior to deployment (T0), and one (T1) and six months (T2) after deployment using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Mental health problems and depressive symptoms were measured with the Dutch revised Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) and PTSD symptoms with the Dutch Self-Rating Inventory for PTSD (SRIP). Six months after deployment increases in GABA concentrations were present in individuals who had developed mental health problems (T2: β=0.06, p=1.6×10-2, T1: β=4.7×10-2, p=0.13), depressive symptoms (T2: β=0.29, p=7.9×10-3, T1: β=0.23, p=0.072) and PTSD symptoms at T2 (T2: β=0.12, p=4.3×10-2, T1: β=0.11, p=0.13). Plasma GABA levels prior to and one month after deployment poorly predicted a high level of psychopathology symptoms either one or six months after deployment. The number of previous deployments, trauma experienced during deployment, childhood trauma, age and sex were not significantly associated with plasma GABA levels over time. Exclusion of subjects who either started or stopped smoking, alcohol or medication use between the three time points rendered the association of increasing GABA levels with the emergence of psychopathology symptoms more pronounced (mental health problems at T2: β=0.09, p=4.2×10-3; depressive symptoms at T2: β=0.35, p=3.5×10-3, PTSD symptoms at T2: β=0.17, p=1.7×10-2). To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide prospective evidence that the development of psychopathology after military deployment is associated with increasing plasma GABA levels. Our finding that plasma GABA rises after the emergence of psychopathology symptoms suggests that GABA increase may constitute a compensatory mechanism and warrants further exploration of the GABA system as a potential target for treatment.",84

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop better risk reduction strategies, among which is increased social resilience. Experiencing a disaster is recognized as a factor that positively influences overall community resilience, with particular effects on social resilience; it appears to be more influential than school education. It also has many negative effects, though. Previous studies underline that citizens do not distinguish between different types of experiences. Thus, we investigated whether a simulated experience of a flood can improve social resilience, without being hampered by negative repercussions. The study was executed in five municipalities in three Italian regions involved in the European project LIFE PRIMES, which planned simulation activities for each studied area. Data, collected through the administration of anonymous questionnaires before and after a flood drill, were processed by applying a multicriteria decision analysis tool (PROMETHEE). Results show that the drill significantly augmented perceived social resilience in the smaller studied communities but not in the larger ones, a fact that should be further investigated. Key Words: multicriteria decision analysis, simulated flood experience, social resilience to disasters.",84

Methods This was a prospective cohort study performed in Southeastern Louisiana 12–24 months following Hurricane Katrina through February 2011. Participants were community-dwelling older adults (n = 2,073) enrolled in the Cohort Study of Medication Adherence Among Older Adults with no known history of CVD events. PTSD symptoms were assessed via telephone interview 12–24 months following Hurricane Katrina using the PTSD CheckList-Specific Version. The presence of PTSD symptoms was defined by scores greater than or equal to 37. Incident CVD events (stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, or CVD death) were identified and adjudicated over a median 3.8-year follow-up period. Results Overall, 8.6% of participants screened positive for PTSD symptoms, and 11.6% had an incident CVD event during follow-up. PTSD symptoms were associated with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for CVD events of 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1, 2.6). The association was present among blacks (aHR, 3.3, 95% CI, 1.7, 6.3) but not whites (aHR, 0.9, 95% CI, 0.4, 1.9); the interaction of PTSD symptoms and race on CVD events was statistically significant. Conclusion PTSD symptoms following Hurricane Katrina were associated with a higher risk of incident CVD in older adults with hypertension, with a stronger association in blacks compared with whites.",84

This study aimed to (a) determine the probable recovery trajectories in physical and mental HRQoL; (b) examine the impact of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on HRQoL scores within these trajectory groups; and (c) examine the influence of predictor covariates on trajectory group membership. 336 (63% female, Mage =44.72; SD =14.77) injured RTC survivors completed the SF-36v2 at approximately 6, 12, and 24 months after sustaining a RTC injury. Participants also completed telephone interviews to assess prior history of psychological disorder and current PTSD at each wave. Three trajectories were identified for SF-36v2 Physical Component Score (PCS): ”gradual recovery” (27.3%);”low but improving” (54.7%); and”severe and chronic” (17.9%). Four trajectories were defined for SF36v2 Mental Component Score (MCS): “unaffected” (19.1%);”severe but improving” (24.1%);”severe and declining” (17.3%); and”low but improving” (39.5%). A PTSD diagnosis significantly reduced SF36v2 component scores only in trajectories associated with poorer outcome. Age was predictive of trajectory group membership for PCS, whereas injury severity was predictive of trajectory group membership for MCS. Use of a compensation seeking sample affects generalizability to the general RTC population. This study identified a concerning subgroup of individuals who have chronic and/or declining physical and mental HRQoL that can be impacted by a diagnosis of PTSD. The development of interventions with a special focus on associated psychological injury is needed to improve the HRQoL of at-risk individuals following RTC injury.",84

Our study aims to explore trajectories of traumatic stress reactions following childhood IPV exposure, and their relation with parental traumatic stress and child emotional security in the interparental subsystem. The sample comprised 303 children (age 3–10, M = 6.20) from families referred to institutions for IPV. Data were collected at home. Three waves of parent-reported questionnaire data were analyzed using latent class growth analysis and linear regression. Five trajectories were identified: ‘resilient’, ‘moderate stable’, ‘struggling’, ‘improving’, and ‘elevated adjusting’. Only the ‘struggling’ trajectory had dysfunctional symptom levels at the final wave. Higher parental traumatic stress predicted ‘improving’ trajectory membership (β = 0.17, p = .033), whereas lower parental traumatic stress (β = −0.20, p = .003) and child emotional insecurity (β = −0.45, p = < .001) predicted ‘resilient’ trajectory membership. Higher child emotional insecurity predicted membership in trajectories with higher initial traumatic stress (improving: β = 0.26, p < .001; struggling: β = 0.31, p < .001; elevated adjusting: β = 0.27, p < .001). Child emotional security did not buffer the effect of parental traumatic stress on likelihood of dysfunctional trajectory membership (β = 0.04, p =.380). Children exposed to IPV show different trajectories of traumatic stress reactions, partly corresponding to trajectories identified in other populations. Child emotional security and parental traumatic stress predict trajectory membership.",85

This paper aimed to examine longitudinal patterns of psychological distress in a sample of 1,504 socially disadvantaged adult participants from the Journeys Home Study in Australia. The current paper utilized the “conservation of resources” theory and the concept of “risk factor caravans” to investigate the nature and implications of childhood trauma in the context of homelessness. Growth mixture modeling revealed four distinct trajectories of psychological distress as measured by the Kessler 6 across six time points (covering a period of 2.5 years): chronic, escalating, attenuating, and resistant. Our results also indicated that experiences of different types of trauma during childhood were associated with these psychological distress trajectories. In particular, adults experiencing chronic psychological distress were significantly more likely than those exhibiting distress resistance to have experienced multiple and varied childhood maltreatment, adjusted odds ratio ( AOR ) = 3.30, 95% CI [0.37, 6.05], p = .002. Furthermore, adult experiences of assault were found to be associated with psychological distress. These findings have important implications for mental health, as well as interventions aimed at breaking the cycle of urban poverty. Specific focus on interpersonal trauma vulnerabilities is important. Prioritizing socioecological stability, with mental health needs assessed on an individual level, may be most appropriate. This work also highlights the need to direct future attention to barriers to access and facilitation of social support services.",85
https://openalex.org/W3128068324,10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.090,Beyond Distress and Fear: Differential Psychopathology Correlates of PTSD Symptom Clusters,"Research suggests that re-experiencing and avoidance are “core” PTSD symptoms, but there has been little research explicating their unique connections to psychopathology other than internalizing conditions such as depression and anxiety. We aim to unpack symptom heterogeneity within PTSD by exploring associations between re-experiencing and avoidance clusters and major psychopathology domains in a dimensional metastructural framework (e.g., the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology, or HiTOP). We used a trauma-exposed community sample (n = 233, 66.1% female, mean age = 45 years) to compare re-experiencing and avoidance's associations with factor-analytically derived dimensions generally corresponding to HiTOP structure: Distress, Fear, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition, Thought Disorder, and Compulsivity. Both re-experiencing and avoidance were robustly related to Fear. Re-experiencing was particularly related to Distress and Thought Disorder, whereas avoidance was related to domains involving overinhibition (e.g., Compulsivity). Relative to avoidance, re-experiencing had broader and more substantial associations with psychopathology, partly as a function of its greater saturation with dysphoria. Coverage of PTSD symptoms was limited to questionnaire measurement of re-experiencing and avoidance clusters. Results need to be replicated in samples selected for posttraumatic psychopathology. Although they are strongly intercorrelated and both are robustly related to Fear, re-experiencing and avoidance differ substantially in their unique relations with other forms of psychopathology, and re-experiencing may be less specific to PTSD than previously thought. These differences can be used to understand the etiology and phenomenology of re-experiencing and avoidance in greater depth to inform more targeted and effective interventions for posttraumatic psychopathology.",85

Design: Prospective, cross sectional. Setting: Rockaways, Queens, NYC community residents. Participants: From October 2013 to April 2015, 407 adult residents of the Rockaways completed self-report, validated measures of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms as well as indicators of substance use (alcohol, illicit substance, and tobacco use) and exposure to Hurricane Sandy. Main Outcome Measures: Depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, alcohol use, illicit substance use, and tobacco use. Results: Differences in exposure scores on outcomes were compared using Wilcoxon tests. Associations between hurricane exposure (categorized into “personal” and “property” exposure) and outcomes were investigated using logistic regression, adjusting for demographic covariates, mental health history, and time since hurricane. The study participants were predominately female (57.5 percent) and black (63.9 percent) and average age was 44.7 years. Multivariable results showed that property exposure scores were positively associated with increased risks of mental health difficulties across all three mental health symptom outcomes, but not substance use. Increased personal and total exposures were also significantly associated with increased Posttraumatic Stress Disorder symptoms. Substance use variables were not significantly associated with any of the hurricane exposure indicators. Conclusions: The present study quantifies the lasting impact that Hurricane Sandy has had on the mental health of Rockaways residents indicating the need for continued recovery efforts and increased mental health service provision in this vulnerable region.",85

Prevalence estimates of insomnia, depression, general anxiety, nightmares, headache and substance use, stratified by injury severity, were derived. Univariate logistic regression was used to examine unadjusted effects for each behavioural health problem and insomnia by injury severity.Results: Participants were primarily male, < 30 years old and high school educated. Twenty-nine per cent met study criteria for insomnia; those with mild TBI were significantly more likely to meet criteria (43%) than those with moderate/severe TBI (22%), χ2(1, n = 112) = 5.088, p ≤ 0.05. Univariable logistic regression analyses revealeddepressive symptoms and general anxiety were significantly associated with insomnia symptoms after TBI of any severity. Headache and binge drinking were significantly inversely related to insomnia symptoms after moderate/severe TBI, but not MTBI.Conclusions: Veterans with history of TBI, of any severity, and current insomnia symptoms may be at increased risk for depression and anxiety 1 year after TBI.",85

In this study, we explored heterogeneity in treatment response for 960 veterans in the United Kingdom with PTSD who had been offered a residential intervention consisting of a mixture of group sessions and individual trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). The primary outcome was PTSD score on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Covariates included depression, anxiety, anger, alcohol misuse, functional impairment, and sociodemographic characteristics. Follow-up occurred posttreatment at set time points for 12 months. We present predictors of PTSD severity at posttreatment and follow-up obtained using a latent class growth analysis to identify different treatment trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify covariates predicting class membership, and five classes were identified. Of participants, 71.3% belonged to three classes showing positive treatment responses, and 1.2% showed initial improvement but later relapsed. Additionally, 27.5% of participants were identified within a treatment-resistant class that showed little change in severity of presentation. Depression, anxiety, and having had a combat role during military service increased the likelihood of membership in the treatment-resistant class, odds ratios (ORs) = 1.12-1.53, 1.16-1.32, and 2.89, respectively. Additionally, participants in the treatment-resistant class had higher pretreatment PTSD scores for reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms, ORs = 5.24, 2.62, and 3.86, respectively. Findings suggest the importance of triaging individuals and offering interventions tailored to severity of presentation.",85

Of the 209 parents of 145 children recruited to the study, 78 (37%) were identified, on the basis of their Posttraumatic Adjustment Scale score at baseline, as being at risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder, and randomized to the control or intervention condition. Follow-up data were provided by 157 of 209 parents (75%). Logistic regression analyses controlling for parent gender and child length of stay showed that high-risk control parents (n = 32) were significantly more likely to score above the clinical cutoff for all three psychological outcomes than parents deemed low risk at baseline (n = 89) (posttraumatic stress: odds ratio = 3.39; 95% CI, 1.28-8.92; p = 0.014; anxiety: odds ratio = 6.34; 95% CI, 2.55-15.76; p < 0.001; depression: odds ratio = 4.13; 95% CI, 1.47-11.61; p = 0.007). Only 14 of 38 (37%) high-risk intervention parents attended the follow-up clinic appointment they were offered. At follow-up, there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups, but there were small effect sizes in favor of the intervention for anxiety scores (Cohen d = 0.209) and depression scores (Cohen d = 0.254) CONCLUSIONS:: Screening parents for psychological vulnerability using measures such as the Posttraumatic Adjustment Scale may enable more efficient targeting of support. However, further research is needed on how best to provide effective follow-up intervention for families.",85
https://openalex.org/W2794253300,10.1093/milmed/usx201,Personality Factors and Their Impact on PTSD and Post-traumatic Growth is Mediated by Coping Style Among OIF/OEF Veterans,"Traumatic experiences can trigger negative effects such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, some individuals may also experience positive changes following trauma exposure. These changes are known as post-traumatic growth (PTG). Dispositional and situational factors are likely at play in determining both severity of PTSD symptoms and whether and to what degree an individual experiences PTG. This study examined how coping style and personality traits interact to influence PTSD and PTG. Two hundred and seventy-one Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom veterans not engaged in mental health treatment completed self-report measures of trauma exposure, personality traits, coping styles, PTSD symptoms, and PTG. The study was approved by the Minneapolis VAHCS Institutional Review Board. Adaptive coping and positive personality traits such as openness were positively correlated with PTG. Maladaptive coping and neuroticism were positively correlated with PTSD symptoms. Regression analyses indicated that an inverted-U (quadratic) curve characterized the relationship between PTSD symptoms and PTG; veterans who reported moderate PTSD levels reported the most PTG. Mediation analyses revealed that adaptive coping partially mediated the relationship between openness and PTG. Maladaptive coping partially mediated the relationship between neuroticism and PTSD symptoms. This study demonstrated that coping style mediated relationships between personality traits and post-trauma outcomes. Our findings are subject to the limitations of the self-report and cross-sectional nature of the data. Longitudinal studies, preferably incorporating coping-oriented interventions, could convincingly demonstrate the impact of coping style on PTSD and PTG. As coping styles can be modified, our findings nonetheless suggest that coping-oriented clinical intervention has potential to reduce PTSD symptoms and promote positive growth following trauma exposure.",85

Impaired inhibition of fear or behavioral responses is thought to be central to PTSD symptomatology, but its role in predicting PTSD is unknown. Here we examine whether brain function during response inhibition early after a civilian trauma can predict future PTSD symptoms. Methods Participants (original sample, n = 27; replication sample, n = 31) were recruited in the emergency department within 24 hours of trauma exposure. PTSD symptoms were assessed in the emergency department and 1, 3, and 6 months posttrauma. A Go/NoGo procedure in a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scanner was used to measure neural correlates of response inhibition 1 to 2 months posttrauma. Elastic net regression was used to define the most optimal model to predict PTSD symptoms at 3 and 6 months among demographic, clinical, and imaging measures. Results Less hippocampal activation was a significant predictor in the model predicting PTSD symptoms at 3 months (F11,22 = 4.33, p = .01) and 6 months (F9,19 = 4.96, p = .01). Other significant predictors in the model were race and pain level in the emergency department (3 months), and race and baseline depression symptoms (6 months). Using these predictors in a linear regression in the replication sample again resulted in significant models (3 months [F3,23 = 3.03, p = .05], 6 months [F3,20 = 5.74, p = .007]) with hippocampal activation predicting PTSD symptoms at 3 and 6 months. Conclusions Decreased inhibition-related hippocampal activation soon after trauma predicted future PTSD symptom severity. This finding may contribute to early identification of at-risk individuals and reveals potential targets for intervention or symptom prevention in the aftermath of trauma.",85

This paper examines trajectories of post‐traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms following exposure to hurricanes and the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill to increase understanding of resilience and chronic reactions to both natural and technological disasters. Methods A multiwave longitudinal design was used to follow N = 4,619 youth who were evaluated for PTSD symptoms, hurricane exposure, and oil spill exposure/stress at four time points over a period of 4 years. Trajectories were identified with cluster analyses and multilevel modeling. Results Individual trajectories were statistically identified consistent with theory. The largest group exhibited stable‐low symptoms (52%), a second group showed steep declines following initial symptoms (21%), a third group exhibited increasing symptoms (18%), and a fourth group showed stable‐high symptoms (9%). Both hurricane exposure and oil spill stress predicted trajectories and overall levels of PTSD symptoms. Conclusions Results identified an effect of oil spill stress and hurricane exposure on symptom levels and trajectories of exposed youth. Results provide prospective data to support theories of multiple symptom trajectories following disasters and reinforce the importance of research that utilizes a developmental perspective to consider the long‐term effects of disasters in youth. Findings highlight the importance of identifying symptoms and predictors of resilience as well as factors that contribute to resilience.",85

This study assessed the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for PTSD in emergency service personnel, and examined if brief exposure (CBT-B) to trauma memories is no less efficacious as prolonged exposure (CBT-L). Method One hundred emergency service personnel with PTSD were randomised to either immediate CBT-L, CBT-B or wait-list (WL). Following post-treatment assessment, WL participants were randomised to an active treatment. Participants randomised to CBT-L or CBT-B were assessed at baseline, post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Both CBT conditions involved 12 weekly individual sessions comprising education, CBT skills building, imaginal exposure, in vivo exposure, cognitive restructuring and relapse prevention. Imaginal exposure occurred for 40 min per session in CBT-L and for 10 min in CBT-B. Results At post-treatment, participants in WL had smaller reductions in PTSD severity (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale), depression, maladaptive appraisals about oneself and the world, and smaller improvements on psychological and social quality of life than CBT-L and CBT-B. There were no differences between CBT-L and CBT-B at follow-up on primary or secondary outcome measures but both CBT-L and CBT-B had large baseline to follow-up effect sizes for reduction of PTSD symptoms. Conclusions This study highlights that CBT, which can include either long or brief imaginal exposure, is efficacious in reducing PTSD in emergency service personnel.",85

In the aftermath of natural hazard events affecting vulnerable communities, there are many situations where there is an urgent need to properly match volunteers to volunteering tasks in order to fully harness their capabilities. Our study explores the relationships between volunteers' capabilities and their perceived satisfaction and performance in conducting volunteering tasks. We carried out a cross-sectional study recruiting a convenience sample of 170 volunteers (spontaneous and affiliated volunteers) who previously participated performing volunteering tasks during socio-natural disasters in Chile. We collected information on sociodemographics, experience in volunteering activities, capabilities (i.e. competencies and relatively stable psychological attributes), and perceived satisfaction and performance in volunteering tasks. Predictive models based on stepwise logistic regressions were fitted, with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) being estimated to assess the discrimination capacity of the predictive models. A heterogeneous set of sociodemographic characteristics, experiences in volunteering activities, and capabilities were statistically significant predictors for each of the assessed volunteering tasks. Most of the predictive models had an adequate discriminatory capacity (AUC >0.70), with models predicting performance (AUC >0.80) exhibiting the best discriminatory capacity. Knowledge of volunteering tasks – a competency – was the most consistent predictor of perceived satisfaction and performance in volunteering tasks. Our findings are a step forward in matching volunteers to volunteering tasks during emergencies from socio-natural disasters. In addition, some of the observed characteristics (e.g. knowledge) could be trained to improve volunteers’ satisfaction and performance.",86

Method This cross‐sectional design includes data from 278 veterans participating in a larger longitudinal research program of postdeployment recovery. Measures included self‐report questionnaires and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale. Results Hierarchical regression was used to evaluate the independent contributions of deployment characteristics on long‐term PTSD symptoms after controlling for demographics and combat exposure. As expected, dwell time was a significant predictor of long‐term PTSD symptoms ( β = − 0.17, p = .042; F 5,108 = 8.21, ∆ R 2 = 0.03, p &lt; .001). Follow‐up analyses indicated that dwell time of less than 12 months was associated with significantly greater long‐term PTSD symptoms than those deployed once or with dwell time greater than 12 months. Conclusion In addition to combat exposure, time between deployments warrants clinical attention as an important deployment characteristic for predicting long‐term PTSD symptoms.",86

A cross‐sectional survey examining exposure to seven psychosocial hazards (bullying/harassment; verbal abuse; physical and sexual assault; and hearing about, seeing the aftermath of, or witnessing a fatality), working conditions, physical health, and the impact of COVID‐19 was administered to 3,912 participants. Outcome measures were the ITQ, PHQ‐9, and GAD‐7. Among trauma‐exposed participants, 24.3% met the criteria for PTSD or CPTSD; 38.6% and 29.2% of all participants scored in the moderate‐to‐severe range on the PHQ‐9 and GAD‐7, respectively. Data were analyzed using logistic and linear regression. Bullying/harassment was positively associated with GAD‐7 scores, f 2 = .001, and PTSD and CPTSD, OR s = 1.83–2.02. Hearing about and witnessing a fatality were associated with PTSD and CPTSD, OR s = 1.77–2.10. Poorer ergonomics at work were positively associated with PHQ‐9 and GAD‐7 scores, f 2 = .001. Higher job satisfaction was associated with lower odds of PTSD and CPTSD, OR s = 0.87–0.91, and negatively associated with PHQ‐9 and GAD‐7 scores, f 2 = .008–.01. Work intensity was associated with PTSD and CPTSD, OR s = 1.79–1.83, and positively associated with PHQ‐9 and GAD‐7 scores, f 2 = .02–.03. Reporting more physical health problems was associated with PTSD, OR = 1.07, and positively associated with GAD‐7 and PHQ‐9 scores, f 2 = .008–.01. The results suggest bullying/harassment and work intensity are important variables in employee mental health and could drive future research and industry initiatives.",86

However, the extent of association and attribution to subsequent disability has varied, with limited studies conducted in urban low-income contexts. This longitudinal study estimated the trajectory of PTSD symptoms up to 7 months after hospitalization and the associated disability level among adult patients who had been hospitalized due to injury. Adult injury patients (N = 476) admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, were interviewed in person in the hospital, and via phone at 1, 2-3, and 4-7 months after hospital discharge. Using latent growth curve modeling, two trajectories of PTSD symptoms emerged: (a) persistently elevated PTSD symptoms (9.2%), and (b) low PTSD symptoms (90.8%). Number of PTEs experienced remained moderately associated with the elevated trajectory after controlling for in-hospital depressive symptoms. Having previously witnessed killings or serious injuries, AOR = 2.32, 95% CI [1.07, 5.05]; being female, AOR = 4.74, 95% CI [4.53, 4.96]; elevated depressive symptoms during hospitalization, AOR = 2.96, 95% CI [1.28, 6.83]; and having no household savings/assets, AOR = 1.28, 95% CI [1.13, 1.44], were associated with the elevated PTSD symptoms trajectory class after controlling for other risk factors. Latent membership in the elevated PTSD trajectory was associated with a significantly higher level of disability several months after hospital discharge, p < .001, after controlling for injury and demographic characteristics. These results underline the associations among in-hospital depressive symptoms, witnessing atrocities, and poverty, and an elevated PTSD symptoms trajectory.Spanish Abstracts by Asociación Chilena de Estrés Traumático (ACET) Exposición al trauma, Trayectoria de los síntomas del trastorno de estrés postraumático y nivel de discapacidad entre los Sobrevivientes de lesiones hospitalizados en Kenia TRAYECTORIAS DE LOS SíNTOMAS DE TEPT EN SOBREVIVIENTES DE TRAUMAS DE KENIA Los eventos potencialmente traumáticos (EPT) se han asociado sistemáticamente con el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT).

The study sample consisted of 520 Palestinian adults selected using online tools. The findings of the study revealed that posttraumatic stress symptoms positively correlated with suicidal ideations (r = .32, p &lt; .01), and negatively correlated with social support (r = −.34, p &lt; .01), spirituality (r = −.16, p &lt; .05) and mindfulness (r = −.72, p &lt; .01), whereas suicidal ideations negatively correlated with social support (r = −.46, p &lt; .01), spirituality(r = −.27, p &lt; .01) and mindfulness (r = −.72, p &lt; .01). Results of the path analysis showed that social support, spirituality and mindfulness mediated the association between posttraumatic stress symptoms and suicidal ideations. Developing intervention programs to enhance social support, mindfulness and spirituality to mitigate the effect of ongoing traumatic experiences among Palestinians is crucial to reducing suicidal ideations. Further studies are also recommended to investigate the role of potentially protective factors that may reduce suicidal ideations and appropriate techniques to deal effectively with traumatic and stressful events.",86

Challenges related to differential diagnosis and measurement of PTSD in ASD are considered and illustrated via a case example. The chapter concludes with an overview of evidence-based treatments for PTSD in people without ASD, and their potential applications for those with ASD. Overall, the limited research on PTSD in ASD thus far points to increased rates of adversity and related psychopathology, but few evidence-based approaches to assessment or treatment of PTSD and other trauma-related symptoms in this population. Future investigations should consider not only PTSD in ASD but also a broader range of potential sources and symptoms of trauma in ASD and work quickly to identify empirically supported assessments and treatments.",86

The study aim was to establish the relationship between personality, ruminations (intrusive and deliberate) and secondary traumatic stress symptoms, including the mediating role of ruminations, in a group of police officers exposed to secondary trauma. Material and methods A group of 235 police officers working, at least partly, with trauma victims were surveyed. The age of the participants ranged from 30 to 60 years (M = 40.79, SD = 3.96). Three questionnaires were used: the Secondary Traumatic Stress Inventory, the NEO Five-Factor Inventory and the Event-Related Rumination Inventory. Results The results demonstrate a rather low level of STS among police officers. Ruminations, particularly intrusive ones, were more strongly connected with symptoms of STS than personality traits. Neuroticism correlated more strongly with STS than other personality traits, and extraversion was not connected with any negative effects of secondary trauma exposure. The conducted analysis confirmed that ruminations act as mediators in the relationship between neuroticism and STS. Conclusions Although the police officers working with trauma victims revealed low levels of STS symptoms, it is nevertheless advisable to ameliorate, if not prevent, them. Interventions should aim to expand the competencies in coping with trauma, including reducing the tendency to ruminate about the traumatic events experienced by clients.",86

Pediatric burn patients are at a higher risk of developing psychopathology compared to the general population. In order to promote resilience and prevent psychopathology post-burn injury for pediatric burn patients, it is crucial to understand the experience of children and young people after a burn. This study aimed to understand the psychosocial impact that a pediatric burn has as perceived by the pediatric burn patient. Methods Seven pediatric burn patients were interviewed from the Perth Metropolitan area on average 3.1 years after their injury. All participants had been admitted to hospital for their acute injury and stayed for a median length of 2 days in hospital. Interviews with pediatric patients took place online, and the patients were asked about their mental health, coping strategies, changes to lifestyle and supports following their burn injury. The interviews were transcribed and then thematically analysed using an inductive approach. Results Three overarching themes emerged from the interviews: burn-specific impact on the child or young person (including appearance concerns, family factors, and lifestyle factors), the psychological impact (including positive and negative impact on mental health), and factors supporting the recovery journey (including coping strategies and support services). The participants in our study highlighted issues they faced during recovery, the positive and negative impacts of the injury and recovery process and provided suggestions for future opportunities to bolster resilience and promote growth for pediatric burn patients who may face similar challenges in the future. Conclusion Factors that improve the mental health and wellbeing of pediatric burn patients should be promoted, such as mental health and social supports, the promotion of adaptive coping mechanisms, and meeting the needs of the family unit as a whole. Ultimately, the implementation of trauma-focused, family centred interventions is crucial for the psychosocial recovery of pediatric burn survivors.",86

This study investigates the impact of asylum interviews on the mental health in a sample of 40 traumatized asylum seekers. The comparison group consisted of refugees (N=10) that had not been invited to an asylum interview. Additionally, the moderating effects of trial-related variables such as perceived justice of the trial, stress of giving testimony, and stress of waiting for the asylum interview were examined.Participants were assessed on average 10 days before (t1) and 16 days after (t2) the asylum interview. Chi-square tests for dichotomous and categorical variables were used to compare the descriptive statistics of the two groups. To investigate symptom changes from t1 to t2, paired t-tests were calculated. The magnitude of effects was measured by Cohen's effect size d within groups. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted for demographic and trial variables predicting posttraumatic intrusions, avoidance, and hyperarousal.Data showed a significant increase in posttraumatic intrusions and a significant decrease in posttraumatic avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms from t1 to t2. No significant symptom changes in the posttraumatic stress disorder subscales were found in the comparison group. The results of hierarchical regression analyses revealed perceived justice of the interview to predict the increase of intrusions and the number of experienced traumata and testimony stress to predict posttraumatic avoidance.The present findings underline the stressful impact of asylum interviews on traumatized refugees. They indicate that the asylum interview might decrease posttraumatic avoidance and trigger posttraumatic intrusions, thus highlight the importance of ensuring that the already vulnerable group of traumatized refugees needs to be treated with empathy during their asylum interview.",86

The long-term effect of deployment on pulmonary function in this population is unknown. This study sought to determine the effect of deployment on post-deployment pulmonary function in active duty military personnel with asthma.A retrospective chart review of active duty military personnel with deployment to southwest Asia and an ICD-9 diagnosis of asthma with documented pre- and post-deployment spirometry was performed.A total of 642 active duty individuals with a diagnosis of asthma and documented spirometry with deployment to southwest Asia between 2006 and 2015 were identified. Of these, 76 individuals were identified with pre- and post-deployment spirometry. There was no significant change in the post-deployment forced expiratory volume at 1 second (% predicted), from 86.0 ± 14.8 to 87.6 ± 14.4 (P = .30). There was no significant change in post-deployment forced vital capacity (% predicted), from 93.8 ± 12.4 to 94.9 ± 12.1 (P = .42). The absolute change in forced expiratory volume at 1 second (L) after bronchodilator administration was decreased from pre-deployment to post-deployment (+0.31 ± 0.26 to +0.16 ± 0.23; P = .02).There was no significant post-deployment change in spirometry in this military population with asthma deployed to southwest Asia. These findings suggest that deployment itself is not associated with any short-term deleterious effect on post-deployment spirometric measures of lung function in many military personnel with asthma.",86

Unfortunately, our understanding of psychiatric disorders following TBI is limited. Specifically, the critical periods for disorder development, expected trajectory and risk factors are ill defined, as no studies have prospectively examined a range of Axis I psychiatric disorders beyond the first year post-injury; this is particularly the case for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite an established evidence-base suggesting that the quality of the family environment (i.e., levels of expressed emotion [EE]) is associated with the development and course of many psychiatric disorders, research in TBI has been extremely limited.

The primary aims of the current research were to: 1) prospectively examine the frequency and course of a broad range of Axis I disorders during the first five years post-injury; 2) investigate the demographic, pre-injury and injury-related factors associated with post-injury psychiatric disorders; 3) describe the evolution of PTSD following TBI; 4) examine the demographic, pre-injury, injury-related and concurrent factors associated with injury-related PTSD; and 5) investigate the utility of family EE in predicting the emergence of psychiatric disorders following TBI. 

Participants with moderate to severe TBI were recruited from consecutive inpatient admissions to a rehabilitation hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants completed a baseline assessment soon after injury and were reassessed at 3, 6 and 12 months, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years post-injury. The Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (SCID-I) was used to diagnose psychiatric disorders. Measures of psychosocial function, quality of life, and family EE were also administered. 

In the first five years post-injury, 75.2% of participants with TBI were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Between one and four years post-injury, disorder frequencies exceeded demographically adjusted population rates. Mood, anxiety and substance-use disorders were the most common and were highly comorbid, with low rates of psychotic, somatoform, adjustment, and eating disorders. Post-injury mood and anxiety disorders typically emerged without a pre-injury history, whilst post-injury substance-use disorders were commonly pre-existing. The majority (77.8%) of participants with a post-injury psychiatric disorder were diagnosed within the first year post-injury. Onset of PTSD was frequently delayed, emerging between 6 and 12 months post-injury. Anxiety disorders showed greater resolution than mood or substance-use disorders; within anxiety disorders, PTSD was associated with the most chronic/recurrent course.

Results of regression analyses indicated that post-injury psychiatric disorders were associated with a pre-injury psychiatric history, sustaining an accident-related limb injury and report of high sensitivity to family criticism following injury. Post-injury mood, anxiety and substance-use disorders were associated with a history of the same diagnostic class prior to injury. Substance-use disorders were also predicted by male gender, younger age and fewer years of education. Examination of post-injury PTSD revealed associations with shorter post-traumatic amnesia duration (PTA), concurrent psychiatric comorbidity, and poorer psychosocial functioning and quality of life following injury.

This research has demonstrated that individuals with TBI experience high rates of psychiatric disorders for several years following injury. Findings also illustrate that whilst premorbid psychiatric history is a strong indicator of risk, demographic, injury-related and familial factors might also promote the early identification of vulnerable individuals. Nonetheless, there is a need for routine psychiatric screening and evidence-based treatment to be integrated into rehabilitation practices for all individuals following TBI, particularly during the first year post-injury when most cases emerge.",87

Elucidating which factors underlie this variation can help us better understand how to improve health trajectories. Here we used a case:control study of refugee and non-refugee youth, differentially exposed to war-related trauma, to investigate the effects of genetics and psychosocial environment on response to trauma. We investigated genetic variants in two genes (serotonin transporter, 5-HTT, and catechol-O-methyltransferase, COMT) that have been implicated in response to trauma. We collected buccal samples and survey data from 417 Syrian refugee and 306 Jordanian non-refugee youth who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a mental health-focused intervention. Measures of lifetime trauma exposure, resilience, and six mental health and psychosocial stress outcomes were collected at three time points: baseline, ~13 weeks, and ~48 weeks. We used multilevel models to identify gene x environment (GxE) interactions and direct effects of the genetic variants in association with the six outcome measures over time. We did not identify any interactions with trauma exposure, but we did identify GxE interactions with both genes and resilience; 1) individuals with high expression (HE) variants of 5-HTTLPR and high levels of resilience had the lowest levels of perceived stress and 2) individuals homozygous for the Val variant of COMT with high levels of resilience showed stable levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms. We also identified a direct protective effect of 5-HTTLPR HE homozygotes on perceived insecurity. Our results point to novel interactions between the protective effects of genetic variants and resilience, lending support to ideas of differential susceptibility and altered stress reactivity in a cohort of war-affected adolescents.",87

The purpose of the present study was to provide an in-depth examination of three injured National Guard soldiers showing how differential experiences of navigating multiple systems to obtain treatment for injury resulted in different adjustment trajectories for these soldiers and their families. A comparative case study examined three families where a soldier's injury was a central theme of family adjustment. Qualitative data were drawn from interviews conducted conjointly with both the soldier and spouse to provide an in-depth perspective of adjustment, meaning, and resource utilization patterns. In addition, survey data were collected at three time points in the deployment cycle (predeployment, 90 days post, and 1 year). These data were integrated into the case analysis, including mental health, marital relationship, treatment history, and characteristics of resilience. Study findings suggest that a delay in diagnosis, wait time for treatment, and the lack of comprehensive formal and financial support for a soldier following nonhostile injury lead to a pileup of stressors that are detrimental to the soldier's physical and mental health, financial stability, and family well-being. Further study is needed to understand how these system level issues impede resilience among National Guard families.",87
https://openalex.org/W3024839413,,Gender differences in trajectories of depressive symptoms across childhood and adolescence: A multi-group growth mixture model,"Background
This study sought to identify depression trajectories across childhood and to model a range of child and family predictors of whether a child may be on an increasing trajectory towards depressive disorder in adolescence.

Methods
Multi-group growth mixture modelling (MGMM) was used on a sample of 4983 children from the Longitudinal Study of Australia Children (LSAC). Depressive symptoms of these children were assessed over 10-years with six time-points, administered every second year commencing at 4 years via the parent report version of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Predictors of class membership were also examined.

Results
Four trajectories were found to be the best fitting model characterising low-stable (75%); decreasing (11%); increasing (9%); high and rising (6%) groups. Females were more likely to be in a trajectory of increasing depressive symptoms between 4 and 14 years of age than males. Reactive temperament and maternal depression at four and six years of age were consistent predictors of increasing and high trajectories while persistent temperament acts as a protective factor for females.

Limitations
The findings should be interpreted in the light of limitations due to common-method variance and the absence of diagnostic indicators of depressive disorder.

Conclusions
We conclude that there are gender differences in patterns of depressive symptoms from childhood to adolescence and meaningful predictors of these early developmental trajectories. Preventative interventions in childhood targeting parents with depression and children with temperamental difficulties may be indicated.",87

The Screening Tool for Early Predictors of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (STEPP) is validated for pediatric trauma victims and their parents. This would help identifying children and caregivers at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and highlight mechanisms of trauma that increase risk. Methods A retrospective review of 142 children and parents admitted to a Level I pediatric trauma center was completed. Variables of age, gender, injury severity score, and mechanism of injury were compared by Student’s t test for normally distributed independent samples and chi-square for categorical variables. A p value of <.05 was considered significant. Results Over 80% of eligible trauma patients and parents underwent a STEPP evaluation. More than 30% (n = 43) were positive. Positive pediatric evaluations were likely to be female; however, age and injury severity score between the two groups were not statistically significant. Although not statically significant, parental STEPP examinations were more likely to be positive than the screen of the injured child, which might have clinical significance. Pediatric STEPP evaluations were mostly positive after motor vehicle crashes and animal bites. Conclusion The STEPP evaluation on pediatric trauma patients and parents is a valuable tool to screen for risk of PTSD. Certain mechanisms of injury resulted in higher rates of positive STEPP evaluations, yet limiting screening based on mechanisms of injury, age, or gender could result in delayed identification of PTSD risk. Screening parents is a key component of the STEPP evaluation, especially when there is discordance between the two.",87

National Guard personnel (n = 608) from the mountain west who denied history of head injury (n = 342, 56.3%) and with history of mTBI (n = 266, 43.7%) were included in the present analyses. Participants completed self-report study measures of emotional (i.e., depression, PTSD symptoms), social (i.e., relationship satisfaction and perceived social support), and other general (i.e., concentration difficulties and sleep disturbance) functioning through an online survey. PTSD symptoms explained unique variance in emotional, social, and general functioning above and beyond history of mTBI. After controlling for PTSD symptoms, mTBI was not associated with current depression symptoms, relationship satisfaction, social support, concentration, or sleep difficulties. Self-report of PTSD symptoms account for emotional, social, and general functioning impairments often attributed to mTBI and labeled postconcussive syndrome. Symptoms often described as postconcussive syndrome in patients with mild traumatic brain injury may be better explained from a psychological standpoint. Patients with history of mTBI and persistent complaints should be screened for mental health conditions. If mental health concerns are present, treatment of that disorder may be indicated.",87

Participants responded to four self-report instruments that assessed, respectively, presence and frequency of several types of early trauma, type of parental attachment, styles of defenses, and current symptoms encompassing a wide variety of psychopathological syndromes.Only 5% of patients reported not having experienced any traumatic experience in childhood. Several traumas such as emotional and physical abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect showed positive and significant associations with several dimensions of current symptoms, and also with parental bonding and defensive styles. When analyzed together with the other variables, defensive styles explained the level of psychological suffering caused by the symptoms.This study offers additional support for understanding the associations between childhood trauma, parental bonding styles, and defense styles and the psychiatric symptoms of patients in analytically oriented psychotherapy.",87
https://openalex.org/W3188302644,10.1002/jts.22722,"Somatic Symptom Severity, Not Injury Severity, Predicts Probable Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder in Wounded Service Members","Although previous studies have reported an association between patient-reported somatic symptom severity and the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) in injured military service members (SMs), conclusions from other studies regarding the association between clinician-determined injury severity and PTSD or MDD remain unclear. The present study investigated whether somatic symptoms or injury severity predict the development of probable PTSD or MDD in wounded SMs medically evacuated from combat areas. Data including SM demographic characteristics, clinician-determined injury severity (i.e., Injury Severity Score [ISS] and Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] values), and self-report assessments of PTSD (PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version), MDD (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9), and somatic symptoms (PHQ-15) were analyzed. A total of 2,217 SMs completed at least one self-assessment between 2003 and 2014, with 425 having completed assessments at each assessment period (AP), conducted 1-75 (AP1), 76-165 (AP2), and 166-255 (AP3) days postinjury. Between AP1 and AP3, the rates of probable PTSD and MDD increased from 3.0% to 11.7% and from 2.8% to 9.2%, respectively. Somatic symptom severity at AP1 predicted probable PTSD and MDD at all three APs, odds ratios (ORs) = 3.5-11.5; however, ISS values did not predict probable PTSD or MDD at any AP, ORs = 0.6-0.9. This suggests that the initial severity of self-reported somatic symptoms rather than clinician-determined injury severity predicts the development of probable PTSD and MDD in wounded SMs.",87

Yet, within this literature, women’s agency in the face of war-related adversity and political violence remains underexplored. The present study was conducted in the Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the most recent war on Gaza in 2014, with the aim of investigating the consequences of war and political violence for women’s mental health and psychological functioning. Based on interviews with 21 Palestinian women exposed to extreme war-related traumatic events, the article offers an analysis of the risk and protective factors affecting their well-being and enhancing (or diminishing) their agency. Human Security, Family Ties, Psychosocial Resources, Individual Resources, and Motherhood emerged from the women’s narratives as key factors contributing to the maintenance of positive psychological functioning and the ability to adjust to traumatic war events in the aftermath of acute armed conflict. These exploratory findings suggest that Palestinian women display a high level of functioning and resources for adjustment that is preserved after periods of devastating armed conflict. The study draws attention to a set of protective factors for the well-being of women and their families when living with chronic political violence.",87

Event centrality is typically measured with the Centrality of Event Scale (CES; Berntsen &amp; Rubin, 2006 ). The present study’s first aim was to investigate the underlying factor structure and construct validity of the Dutch 20-item CES (CES-20) in undergraduates ( N = 1,091). The second aim was to test whether the CES-20 could prospectively predict posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms four months later. The data supported a one-factor structure of the CES with a high internal consistency (α = .95), which is not in line with the theoretical model of event centrality but aligns with previous empirical research. Furthermore, high construct validity was evidenced by positive and significant relations between the CES and PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, DSM-5 trauma A criterion, and the number of experienced negative life events. Event centrality was not a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms four months later when controlling for PTSD symptoms at time 1, which questions the prospective relation between event centrality and later PTSD symptoms for those events.",87

Thus far, the few studies that have investigated the RI-5's factor structure have supported a four-factor model. However, to date this research has been limited to youth with histories of exposure to single-event traumatic stressors, a significant limitation as evidence suggests many trauma-exposed youth report exposure to multiple types of traumatic stressors, or polyvictimization. It is imperative to determine the generalizability of previous factor models to specific populations which they are purported to represent. We investigated whether the RI-5's four-factor model replicated in a sample of 455 polyvictimized justice-involved adolescents. Initial confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the four-factor model did not converge. Therefore, we utilized Bayesian Structural Equations Modeling (BSEM) to determine why the previously proposed factor structure did not converge. The BSEM model suggested that the global factor structure was acceptable and did not require addition or subtraction of any factor or cross-factor loadings. However, small and moderate residual covariances resulted in model misspecification, suggesting there may be additional associations not captured by the current DSM-5 model for polyvictimized youth. Future work should continue examining the RI-5's factor structure in order to better understand whether the current results are unique and how measurements assessing DSM-5 PTSD symptom criteria perform in diverse trauma-exposed youth populations.",87

The 57 studies herein varied in both experimental design and target populations.Forty-eight studies found associations between peritraumatic distress and PTSD outcome measures, 23 found associations between peritraumatic distress and other psychiatric outcomes, and three found associations between peritraumatic distress and PTSD-related symptoms or other psychiatric outcomes after non-Criterion A stressful events by DSM-5 criteria.Peritraumatic distress is associated with PTSD symptom severity, other psychiatric symptoms, and severity of PTSD-related symptoms after exposure to non-Criterion A events, suggesting that peritraumatic distress is a risk factor for various psychiatric outcomes and furthering our understanding of the impact of subjective experience on trauma psychopathology.",87

We focus on the main and risk-buffering effects of childhood and adolescent protective factors for predicting adulthood violence (official records and self reports). Males (N = 436) from the Columbia County Longitudinal Study participated. The youth, their parents, and peers were first interviewed when the youth were age 8; the youth were later interviewed at ages 19, 30, and 48. Risk factors for adulthood violence included higher aggression and lower family socioeconomic status at ages 8 and 19. Protective factors included anxiety about behaving aggressively (ages 8 and 19), popularity (ages 8 and 19), family church attendance (age 8), lower negative family interactions (age 8), and higher educational aspirations (age 19). For youth with at least one risk factor, the sum of adolescent—but not childhood–protective factors reduced the likelihood of adulthood violence. The most critical adolescent risk-buffering protective factors were anxiety about behaving aggressively and educational aspirations. Aggression and low family SES, even by age 8, place youth at risk for adulthood violence. Interventions to strengthen critical protective factors must continue into late adolescence to reduce the likelihood of adulthood violence among at-risk youth.",87

This study explored the possible risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder following childbirth (PTSD-FC) in mothers and partners.Through a cross-sectional online survey biographical, medical, psychological, obstetrical and trauma history data were collected. The PTSD-FC, postnatal depression, social support, and perceived mother-infant bond in 916 mothers and 64 partners were measured through self-reported psychometric assessments.Our findings highlight the possible impact of several risk factors such as emergency childbirth, past traumatic experiences and distressing events during childbirth on PTSD-FC. The difficulties in mother-infant bond and the postpartum depression were highly associated with the total score of PTSD-FC symptoms for mothers. While for partners, post-partum depression was highly associated with the total score of PTSD-FC.Our study demonstrated significant links between psychological, traumatic and birth-related risk factors as well as the perceived social support and the possible PTSD following childbirth in mothers and partners. Given that, a specific attention to PTSD-FC and psychological distress following childbirth should be given to mothers and their partners following childbirth.",87

Of 194 patients, 88 were eligible for randomization. <h3>Interventions</h3> Participants received D-CPT or WL/TA. Cognitive processing therapy was enhanced by a motivational and alliance-building phase, by including emotion regulation and consideration of typical developmental tasks, and by higher session frequency in the trauma-focused core CPT phase. In WL/TA, participants received treatment advice with respective recommendations of clinicians and were offered D-CPT after 7 months. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> All outcomes were assessed before treatment (baseline), approximately 8 weeks after the start of treatment, after the end of treatment (posttreatment), and at the 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity, was assessed in clinical interview (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Children and Adolescents for<i>DSM-IV</i>[CAPS-CA]). Secondary outcomes were self-reported PTSD severity, depression, borderline symptoms, behavior problems, and dissociation. <h3>Results</h3> The 88 participants (75 [85%] female) had a mean age of 18.1 years (95% CI, 17.6-18.6 years). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the 44 participants receiving D-CPT (39 [89%] female) demonstrated greater improvement than the 44 WL/TA participants (36 [82%] female) in terms of PTSD severity (mean CAPS-CA scores, 24.7 [95% CI, 16.6-32.7] vs 47.5 [95% CI, 37.9-57.1]; Hedges<i>g</i> = 0.90). This difference was maintained through the follow-up (mean CAPS-CA scores, 25.9 [95% CI, 16.2-35.6] vs 47.3 [95% CI, 37.8-56.8]; Hedges<i>g</i> = 0.80). Treatment success was greatest during the trauma-focused core phase. The D-CPT participants also showed greater and stable improvement in all secondary outcomes, with between-groups effect sizes ranging from 0.65 to 1.08 at the posttreatment assessment (eg, for borderline symptoms, 14.1 [95% CI, 8.0-20.2] vs 32.0 [95% CI, 23.8-40.2]; Hedges<i>g</i>= 0.91). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Adolescents and young adults with abuse-related PTSD benefited more from D-CPT than from WL/TA. Treatment success was stable at the follow-up and generalized to borderline symptoms and other comorbidities. <h3>Trial Registration</h3> German Clinical Trials Register identifier:DRKS00004787",87

These techniques can be used to inform specific questions such as (1) what are the trajectories and rates of change in a behavior (e.g., latent growth modeling); (2) what are the relations of changes in behavior (e.g., bivariate latent growth models); (3) can we predict outcomes using measures of change (e.g., latent growth models with exogenous outcomes); and (4) when are events most likely to occur for individuals along some temporal metric (e.g., discrete-time survival analysis).

In this paper we construct a measure of adult resilience, document its distribution, and test its predictability by childhood socioeconomic circumstances. We use a dynamic finite mixture model applied to 17 years of panel data, and focus on the psychological reaction to ten major adverse life events. These include serious illness, major financial events, redundancy and crime victimisation. Our model accounts for non-random selection into events, anticipation of events, and differences between individuals in the immediate response and the speed of adaptation. We find considerable heterogeneity in the response to adverse events, and that resilience is strongly correlated with clinical measures of mental health. Resilience in adulthood is predictable by childhood socioeconomic circumstances; the strongest predictor is good childhood health.",88

The present study investigated the long-term course of such PTSD and its predictors in young children.Methods: Young children (aged 2-10 years) and parents/caregivers who had attended emergency departments after motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) between May 2004 and November 2005 were assessed at 2 to 4 weeks and 6 months post-MVC; 71 families were re-interviewed 3 years post-MVC. Participants were assessed according to standard DSM-IV criteria for PTSD and a well-validated alternative algorithm for diagnosing PTSD in young children (PTSD-AA). Demographic, trauma-related, and parental mental health variables and intellectual ability were also assessed at baseline.Results: Using an ""optimal-report"" procedure (a positive diagnosis according to parent or child for older children, or just parent for younger children), 7.0% met criteria for DSM-IV PTSD and 16.9% for PTSD-AA at 3 years. Using parent report alone, these rates were 1.4% and 2.8%, respectively. Parent-child agreement for PTSD and PTSD-AA was no better than chance (Cohen κ = -0.03 and -0.04, respectively). Baseline parent posttraumatic stress relating to the child's trauma, and not trauma severity, was correlated with optimal-report child PTSD-AA at each assessment (r values = 0.29-0.31) and accounted for unique variance in logistic regression models of this outcome at each assessment.Conclusions: PTSD-AA in young children can persist for years but is underrecognized by parents despite its being shaped to a large extent by parents†own acute traumatic stress in response to the child's trauma.",88

The study also examined whether bully and cyberbully victimization and perpetration significantly predicted depressive symptom trajectories.Data from a sample of 1042 high school students were examined. The sample had a mean age of 15.09 years (SD=.79), was 56.0% female, and was racially diverse: 31.4% Hispanic, 29.4% White, and 27.9% African American. Data were examined using growth mixture modeling.Four depressive symptoms trajectories were identified, including those with a mild trajectory of depressive symptoms, an increasing trajectory of depressive symptoms, an elevated trajectory of depressive symptoms, and a decreasing trajectory of depressive symptoms. Results indicated that bully victimization and cyberbully victimization differentially predicted depressive symptoms trajectories across adolescence, though bully and cyberbully perpetration did not.Limitations include reliance on self-reports of bully perpetration and a limited consideration of external factors that may impact the course of depression.These findings may inform school personnel in identifying students' likely trajectory of depressive symptoms and determining where depression prevention and treatment services may be needed.",88

Especially, body recovery duties and nuclear disaster response were known as challenging missions that can induce severe adverse psychological responses for a long time. The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE), an unprecedented complex disaster (i.e., earthquake/tsunami/nuclear accident), provided us with a unique opportunity to explore these risk factors and their relative influence for PTSD. 

Methods: Of approximately 70 000 eligible Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) first responders, 56 388 enrolled in this 6-year prospective cohort study. The data were collected at eight time points: one, six, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months post-mission completion. The Impact of Event Scale–Revised assessed PTSD symptoms; scores of ≥25 were defined as probable PTSD. Professional disaster experience (i.e., duties with body recovery or radiation exposure risk), sociodemographic factors (e.g., disaster–victim status) and working conditions (e.g., deployment length) were investigated. Cox proportional hazard models assessed the risk factors for incidences of probable PTSD. 

Findings: The cumulative incidence of probable PTSD was 6·75%. The classes categorized by baseline severity of PTSD symptoms demonstrated a high degree of rank-order stability over time. Rather than professional disaster experience, sociodemographic factors and working conditions showed strong independent association with the incidence of probable PTSD: disaster-victim status (hazard ratio [HR]=1·96; 95% CI 1·72-2·24), deployment length of ≥3 months (vs. <1 month; HR=1·75; 95% CI 1·52-2·03), older age (≥46 vs. ≤25 years; HR=2·28; 95% CI 1·79-2·91), and post-deployment overwork of ≥3 months (vs. little to none; HR=1·61; 95% CI 1·39-1·87). 

Interpretation: In the future, first responders’ PTSD symptoms might be mitigated by shortening deployment length, avoiding post-deployment overwork, and paying special attention to personnel with disaster-victim status or older age. Efforts to alleviate responders’ initial symptoms will be required.

Participants were a community sample of 506 (183 women) active duty, National Guard/reservists, and veterans who completed an online survey assessing pre-military abuse, pre-military mental health symptoms, combat exposure, and hazardous drinking. Results using structural equation modeling showed that while controlling for gender and combat exposure, pre-military sexual abuse was associated with higher negative mental health symptoms prior to joining the military, which in turn was associated with higher reports of current alcohol consumption. Our findings suggest that hazardous alcohol use may not be strictly related to experiences on the battlefield and that mental health prior to military enlistment may be associated with later alcohol consumption.

Where parents develop PTSD, it may have an impact on their parenting role. Objective: The objective was to review the existing evidence base on parental PTSD, examining whether parental PTSD has an impact on key parenting domains. Method: A comprehensive web-based search identified 27 quantitative studies that examined parental PTSD in relation to parenting domains. Results: Several parenting domains were investigated including: parenting satisfaction, parenting stress, the parent-child relationship, and specific parenting practices. Sample sizes ranged from 19 to 3931 parents. A range of parental traumas were investigated, including traumatic birth experiences, military trauma, and intimate partner violence. Findings indicated associations between parental PTSD and several domains of parenting, but there were inconsistencies across studies. Conclusions: Findings suggested that parental PTSD is associated with impaired functioning across a number of parenting domains, including increased levels of parenting stress, lower parenting satisfaction, less optimal parent-child relationships, and more frequent use of negative parenting practices, such as overt hostility and controlling behaviours. However, methodological limitations across the literature as a whole limited the potential to infer causal impacts of PTSD on parenting. Further study is also needed to advance our current understanding around the impact of different trauma types on parenting domains.Antecedentes: El trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT) es un trastorno grave y debilitante que puede desarrollarse después de la exposición a un evento traumático. El hecho que los padres desarrollen TEPT, puede tener un impacto en su rol parental de crianza.Objetivo: El objetivo de esta revisión fue revisar la base de evidencia existente sobre el TEPT de los padres, y analizar si el TEPT de los padres tiene un impacto en los dominios de crianza de los hijos.Método: una búsqueda exhaustiva a través de internet identificó 27 estudios cuantitativos que examinaron el TEPT de los padres en relación con los dominios de crianza.Resultados: se investigaron varios dominios de crianza de los hijos, incluidos: satisfacción parental, estrés parental, la relación padre-hijo y prácticas de crianza específicas. Los tamaños de muestra oscilaron entre 19 y 3931 padres. Se investigó una variedad de traumas parentales, que incluyeron experiencias traumáticas de nacimiento, traumas militares y violencia de pareja. Los hallazgos indicaron asociaciones entre el TEPT de los padres y varios dominios de crianza de los hijos, pero hubo inconsistencias entre los estudios.Conclusiones: los hallazgos sugirieron que el trastorno de estrés postraumático de los padres se asocia con un funcionamiento deficiente en varios dominios de crianza de los hijos, incluido un mayor nivel de estrés parental, menor satisfacción parental, relaciones menos óptimas entre padres e hijos, y un uso más frecuente de prácticas de crianza negativas, como la hostilidad manifiesta y conductas controladoras. Sin embargo, las limitaciones metodológicas en toda la literatura en su conjunto limitaron el potencial para inferir los impactos causales del TEPT en la crianza de los hijos.

This provides a strong case for ongoing research with youth involved in the child welfare system to reduce negative outcomes and support resilience while being inclusive of youth voices. However, detailed inquiries about maltreatment history and health consequences may cause re-experiencing of events and psychological distress for study participants. Data that accounts for different contexts, such as severity of maltreatment history and current trauma symptomatology, have been limited in considering the question of potential harms to youth who participate in research-especially longitudinal studies.This study compared self-reported impact of research participation against maltreatment history and current post-traumatic stress symptomatology among a randomly selected group of adolescents (< 18 years old) in the child protection service (CPS) system.Adolescents who report more serious child maltreatment and current trauma symptom severity reported higher scores on distress questions from pre- to post-assessment participation. Critically, participants who were more negatively impacted by study involvement also reported greater benefit from study involvement.The increase in both negative and positive impact does not shift the risk/reward ratio for participation, as risks alone do not increase for this vulnerable group of CPS involved youth. These results are consistent with previous findings from studies involving non-CPS populations and underlies the importance of empirical data to address the question of change in the risk/reward ratio and what factors might play a role in any change. This information can inform inclusion/exclusion criteria for future research with these vulnerable populations, thereby reducing the risk of distress among study participants.",88

Thus, the objective of this study was to explore the question: To what extent does media coverage of traumatic global issues influence the development of complex PTS in adolescents in Greater Houston? The conclusions of this study aim to explore PTS prevention and mitigate long-term physiological consequences of increased cortisol levels. The study utilized a mixed-method approach of a quantitative survey on 49 adolescents from ages twelve to eighteen in the Houston region and was measured through a Likert Scale system of participants’ relatability to presented scenarios. The second part of the method conducted qualitative interviews with a parent and a psychologist to qualify the survey results and provide a scientific perspective respectively. Results were analyzed through thematic analysis of major internal and environmental factors that contribute to child PTS including amount of exposure, Covid-specific circumstances, gender, personality, and previous trauma. The study concludes that children have more media exposure in the Digital Age and are experiencing increased anxiety, causing growing concern of long-term effects on emotional health. Further research will need to be conducted to determine whether media exposure is the primary trigger of stress and how personality plays a role in an individual’s perception of media.",88

Twenty-four were randomized to CBT, 22 to wait list, and 15 crossed-over from wait list to CBT. A blind independent evaluator (IE) rated symptom severity on the ADHD Current Symptom Scale, by adolescent and parent report, and rated each subject using the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI), a global measure of distress and impairment. These assessments were performed at baseline, 4-months (post-CBT or post wait list), and 8-months (post-treatment for those originally assigned to the wait list condition and 4-month follow-up for those originally assigned to CBT).http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01019252.Using all available data, mixed effects modeling, and pooling for the wait list cross-over, participants who received CBT received a mean score 10.93 lower on the IE-rated parent assessment of symptom severity (95% CI: -12.93, -8.93; p < .0001), 5.24 lower on the IE-rated adolescent assessment of symptom severity (95% CI: -7.21, -3.28; p < .0001), and 1.17 lower IE-rated CGI (95% CI: -1.39, -.94; p < .0001).

Humans turn to their existential relations for survival following disasters; yet, religion and spirituality (R/S) remains underinvestigated in disaster contexts, with most studies measuring general R/S concepts in Christian samples. To address the resulting gap, this study sought to (a) establish short form, disaster-specific scales of perceived spiritual support (PSS); (b) test the factor's relationships with mental health outcomes; and (c) explore moderators of those relationships.With strong community engagement, a culturally diverse sample (N = 566) completed an online survey after Hurricanes Maria and Michael (H-MM). Multivariate analyses established psychometric properties for 2 PSS short-form scales (PSSS-S1 and -S2) and revealed associations between and moderators of (disaster-related experiences and character strengths) the scales and 2 traumatic outcomes: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and posttraumatic growth (PTG).PSSS-S1 and -S2 demonstrated adequate reliability and validity. PSS was associated inversely with PTSD symptoms at a marginal level but positively and strongly with PTG. Character strengths moderated the link of PSS to PTSD but not PTG. Most disaster-related factors were associated with both outcomes.The findings highlight the function of PSS in survival. PSSS-S1 and -S2 are adequate measures for rapid and cross-cultural data collection in extreme disasters. The differential associations of PSS and moderators with the 2 outcomes can be interpreted in light of 2 forms of well-being, which may have implications for theory, research, and practice in trauma psychology.
