Although, most individuals demonstrate resilience, a significant subset of the population develops significant long-term distress (La Greca et al. 2013; Lai, et al., 2015; Lowe & Rhodes 2013; Self-Brown et al., 2014). Moreover, results from emerging longitudinal research suggests that symptom patterns are heterogenous. For example, some individuals recover over time or demonstrate a delayed onset. The most commonly studied post-disaster reaction in adults is posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. However, the extant literature examining elevated PTS symptoms and related risk factors in disaster research has relied largely on cross-sectional post-hoc designs, with few studies examining PTS symptom trajectories from a longitudinal perspective. The current study sought to build upon post-disaster recovery theory, by examining PTS trajectories in a diverse sample of primarily low-income mothers impacted by Hurricane Katrina, as well as identifying predictor variables (i.e., prior trauma, hurricane exposure, coping behavior, social support, and family functioning) associated with specific symptom trajectories. Data was collected over two years following the Hurricane Katrina (2005-2007). Utilizing Latent Class Growth Analysis, results revealed that a three-trajectory model (i.e., recovering, chronic, and resilient) best fit the data. Significant risk and protective factors differentiating trajectory membership included prior trauma, hurricane-related loss and disruption, social support, and children’s internalizing symptoms. Implications of study findings and directions for future research are discussed.",0.96241222

This paper examines trajectories of post‐traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms following exposure to hurricanes and the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill to increase understanding of resilience and chronic reactions to both natural and technological disasters. Methods A multiwave longitudinal design was used to follow N = 4,619 youth who were evaluated for PTSD symptoms, hurricane exposure, and oil spill exposure/stress at four time points over a period of 4 years. Trajectories were identified with cluster analyses and multilevel modeling. Results Individual trajectories were statistically identified consistent with theory. The largest group exhibited stable‐low symptoms (52%), a second group showed steep declines following initial symptoms (21%), a third group exhibited increasing symptoms (18%), and a fourth group showed stable‐high symptoms (9%). Both hurricane exposure and oil spill stress predicted trajectories and overall levels of PTSD symptoms. Conclusions Results identified an effect of oil spill stress and hurricane exposure on symptom levels and trajectories of exposed youth. Results provide prospective data to support theories of multiple symptom trajectories following disasters and reinforce the importance of research that utilizes a developmental perspective to consider the long‐term effects of disasters in youth. Findings highlight the importance of identifying symptoms and predictors of resilience as well as factors that contribute to resilience.",0.957404215

Aims We aimed to explore post-traumatic stress symptom severity trajectories and their risk factors in first responders to the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) – a historically large earthquake that resulted in a tsunami and a nuclear disaster. Method A total of 55 632 Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) personnel dispatched to the GEJE were enrolled in this 7-year longitudinal cohort study. PTSD symptom severity was measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Trajectories were identified using latent growth mixture models (LGMM).

Data were collected via structured interviews and self-report questionnaires 1 month prior to deployment and again at 1, 5, and 8 months postdeployment. Second-order growth mixture modeling was used to disaggregate symptom trajectories; multinomial logistic regression and relative weights analysis were used to assess the role of combat exposure, prior life span trauma, social support, peritraumatic dissociation, and avoidant coping as predictors of trajectory membership. Three trajectories best fit the data: a low-stable symptom course (79%), a new-onset PTSD symptoms course (13%), and a preexisting PTSD symptoms course (8%). Comparison in a separate MRS cohort with lower levels of combat exposure yielded similar results, except for the absence of a new-onset trajectory. In the main cohort, the modal trajectory was a low-stable symptoms course that included a small but clinically meaningful increase in symptoms from predeployment to 1 month postdeployment. We found no trajectory of recovery from more severe symptoms in either cohort, suggesting that the relative change in symptoms from predeployment to 1 month postdeployment might provide the best indicator of first-year course. The best predictors of trajectory membership were peritraumatic dissociation and avoidant coping, suggesting that changes in cognition, perception, and behavior following trauma might be particularly useful indicators of first-year outcomes.",0.948410186
https://openalex.org/W1540984113,10.1002/jts.21988,The Relationship Between Course of PTSD Symptoms in Deployed U.S. Marines and Degree of Combat Exposure,"Abstract Large cohort studies suggest that most military personnel experience minimal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following warzone deployment, an outcome often labeled resilience . Very low symptom levels, however, may be a marker for low exposure, not resilience, which requires relatively high‐magnitude or high‐frequency stress exposure as a precondition. We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to examine the longitudinal course of lifetime PTSD symptoms following combat exposure by disaggregating deployed U.S. Marines into upper, middle, and lower tertiles of combat exposure. All factor models fit the data well; Tucker‐Lewis Index (TLI) and comparative fit index (CFI) values ranged from .91 to .97. Three distinct trajectories best explained the data within each tertile. The upper tertile comprised True Resilience (73.2%), New‐Onset Symptoms (18.3%), and Pre‐existing Symptoms (8.5%) trajectories. The middle tertile also comprised True Resilience (74.5%), New‐Onset Symptoms (16.1%), and Pre‐existing Symptoms (9.4%) trajectories. The lower tertile comprised Artifactual Resilience (86.3%), Pre‐existing Symptoms (7.6%), and New‐Onset Symptoms (6.1%) trajectories. True Resilience involved a clinically significant symptom increase followed by a return to baseline, whereas Artifactual Resilience involved consistently low symptoms. Conflating artifactual and true resilience may inaccurately create the expectation of persistently low symptoms regardless of warzone exposure.",0.939717356

Understanding the long-term development of depressive symptoms after deployment is important to improve decision-making regarding deployment and mental health policies in the military. Therefore, this study aims to investigate trajectories of depressive symptoms from pre- to post-deployment and assess the role of specific factors, such as demographics, early life trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and deployment stressors, in the Dutch army. Methods The study includes a cohort of 1032 military men and women deployed to Afghanistan between 2005 and 2008. From pre-to 10 years post-deployment (across 6 distinct time points), depressive and PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Symptom CheckList-90 (SCL-90) and the Self-Rating Inventory for PTSD (SRIP) respectively. Demographics, early trauma, and deployment experiences were collected at baseline and after deployment, respectively. Latent Class Growth Analysis was used to explore heterogeneity in developmental trajectories of depressive symptoms over time. Results The study identified four trajectories for depressive symptoms: resilient (65%), intermediate-stable (20%), symptomatic-chronic (9%), and late-onset-increasing (6%). The late-onset-increasing group had the highest proportion of individuals younger than 21 years. In addition, the resilient group was less likely to have experienced deployment stressors and the symptomatic-chronic group reported more early life traumas compared to the other groups. For individuals classified in trajectories with higher levels of depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms were higher at all time points. Conclusions Multiple trajectories for depressive symptoms were identified in a military sample up to 10 years after deployment. These trajectories were associated with age, early trauma, deployment stressors and PTSD symptoms. The majority of the sample fell within the resilient trajectory, supporting the notion that deployed military personnel possess a high level of resilience. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights and a foundation for further research in this area.",0.939502317

Although these studies have provided insight into the prototypical patterns of postdisaster mental health, the factors that account for these patterns remain unclear. In the current analysis, we aimed to fill this gap through a mixed-methods study of female participants in the Resilience in Survivors of Katrina (RISK) study. Latent class growth analysis identified six trajectories of psychological distress in the quantitative sample (n = 386). Qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with 54 participants identified predisaster, disaster-related and postdisaster experiences that could account for the trends in the quantitative data. In particular, preexisting and gains in psychosocial resources (e.g., emotion regulation, religiosity) and positive postdisaster impacts (e.g., greater neighborhood satisfaction, improved employment opportunities) were found to underlie resilience and other positive mental health outcomes. Conversely, experiences of childhood trauma, and pre and postdisaster stressors (e.g., difficulties in intimate partner relationships) were common among participants in trajectories representing adverse psychological responses. Illustrative case studies that exemplify each trajectory are presented. The results demonstrate the utility of mixed-methods analysis to provide a richer picture of processes underlying postdisaster mental health.",0.934579435

Participants were assessed 4 times: 1 month before deployment, 2–3 months after returning from deployment, 1 year later, and 2 years postdeployment. Growth mixture modeling revealed 3 distinct trajectories: low‐stable symptoms, resilient, 76.4%; new‐onset symptoms, 14.2%; and chronic distress, 9.4%. Relative to the resilient class, membership in both the new‐onset symptoms and chronic distress trajectory classes was predicted by negative emotionality/neuroticism, odds ratios ( OR s) = 1.09, 95% CI [1.02, 1.17], and OR = 1.22, 95% CI [1.09,1.35], respectively; and combat exposure, OR = 1.07, 95% CI [1.02, 1.12], and OR = 1.12, 95% CI [1.02, 1.24], respectively. Membership in the new‐onset trajectory class was predicted by predeployment military preparedness, OR = 0.95, 95% CI [0.91, 0.98], perceived threat during deployment, OR = 1.07, 95% CI [1.03, 1.10], and stressful life events following deployment, OR = 1.44, 95% CI [1.05, 1.96]. Prior deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan, OR = 3.85, 95% CI [1.72, 8.69], predeployment depression, OR = 1.27, 95% CI [1.20, 1.36], and predeployment concerns about a deployment's impact on civilian/family life, OR = 1.09, 95% CI [1.02, 1.16], distinguished the chronic distress group relative to the resilient group.

The aims were to examine the course of grief among bereaved disaster survivors up to six years post loss and factors predicting worse bereavement outcome. A third aim was to explore differences in grief indicators between trajectories. Methods Bereaved Swedish tourists who survived the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis responded to surveys including the Inventory of Complicated Grief 1 to 6 years after the disaster. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify longitudinal trajectories of grief. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine predictors of class membership. Results Three trajectories were identified: resilient (41% of the sample), recovering (48%), and chronic (11%). The strongest predictor of chronic grief was the loss of one’s child. When examining grief indicators, the chronic trajectory was characterized by not accepting the loss, while yearning was common in all trajectories. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of considering how traumatically bereaved individuals can be affected by loss for several years after a disaster, especially after losing one’s child. An inability to accept the loss, more so than yearning, appears to characterize bereaved survivors at risk of a chronic trajectory of grief.",0.933095985

The current study aims to identify traumatic stress symptom trajectories during conflict, as well as potential risk factors. Experience sampling methods were used to study traumatic stress symptoms during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict in 100 Israeli civilians exposed to rocket fire. Summary reports of traumatic symptoms were made twice-daily for 30 days via mobile phone. Latent class growth analysis revealed four distinct classes (low, reducing, moderate, and high) characterised by their trajectory of traumatic stress symptoms during the conflict. Female gender, not being in a relationship, and higher prior trauma exposure were identified as potential risk factors. Data were not collected in the early phase of the conflict, the sample was relatively small, and only traumatic stress symptoms were investigated as outcomes. This study identified heterogeneous traumatic stress symptom trajectories among civilians during a conflict, with different subgroups showing distinct response patterns over time, associated with various risk factors. Investigating responses to ongoing trauma, and identifying predictors of different stress symptom trajectories has clinical implications for the targeted delivery of interventions. Further exploration of heterogeneous trajectories could potentially elucidate mechanisms that drive resilience and recovery, including in situations of ongoing exposure such as during conflict.",0.931029242

Earlier studies have identified specific mental health trajectories both in children and adults. This study aimed, first, to identify potential PTSS-related trajectories by using latent class growth analyses among children in a three-wave assessment after the 2008/2009 War on Gaza, Palestine. Second, it analyzed how family- and child related factors (e.g., attachment relations, posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs), guilt, and emotion regulation) associate with the trajectory class membership. The sample consisted of 240 Palestinian children (49.4% girls and 50.6% boys) of 10–13 years of age (M=11.29, SD=0.68), who completed PTSS (CRIES) assessments at 3 (T1), 5 (T2), and 11 (T3) months after the war. Children reported their personal exposure to war trauma, attachment style, cognitive trauma processing, and emotion regulation, and their parents reported family war trauma exposure and attachment style. Results revealed a three-trajectory solution, a majority of children belonging to the Recovery trajectory (n=183), and a minority belonged either to Resistant trajectory (n=29) or to Increasing symptoms trajectory (n=28). Low levels of negative posttraumatic cognitive appraisals, feelings of guilt and emotion regulation were characteristic of children in the Resistant trajectory as compared to Increasing symptoms trajectory. Father׳s attachment security was further associated with the Resistant trajectory membership. Children׳s attachment avoidance and high parental trauma were typical to children in Recovery trajectory (as compared to the Increasing symptoms trajectory).",0.930451561

However, it is yet unclear what longitudinal patterns of posttraumatic symptom levels may predict the development of PTG. Methods World Trade Center (WTC) rescue and recovery workers (2038 police and 2103 non-traditional responders) were assessed an average of 3, 6, 8, and 12 years post-9/11/2001. Responders’ WTC-related PTSD symptoms were characterized by No/Low Symptom, Worsening/Subtly Worsening, Steeply Worsening (only for non-traditional responders), Improving, and Chronic trajectories. PTSD symptom trajectories were examined as predictors of PTG, which was assessed using total scores on the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory-Short Form. Results Across both occupational groups, being female, older, Hispanic, and experiencing more post-9/11 traumatic events were independently associated with self-reported PTG. Among police responders, a greater number of WTC exposures and supportive family members while working at the WTC site were linked to higher PTG. Among non-traditional responders, Black race/ethnicity, less education, fewer pre-9/11 traumatic events, and the presence of support while working at the WTC site were additionally linked to higher PTG. Only the moderate PTSD symptom trajectories (ie, worsening and improving) for police responders and all symptomatic trajectories for non-traditional responders were associated with higher levels of PTG. Conclusions Symptomatic 12-year trajectories of PTSD symptoms and certain sociodemographic characteristics, stressor exposures, and supportive resources were associated with PTG in traditional and non-traditional WTC responders. Results provide insight into subgroups of WTC responders who may benefit from PTG-promoting interventions, as well as potentially modifiable targets to help foster PTG in this population.",0.928279442

Resulting classes were compared on key characteristics at 6 and 21 weeks postinjury.Three trajectories were identified: a nonreactive class (67.8%) with low initial symptom levels that remained low, a moderate-stable class (27.9%) with elevated symptom levels that remained constant, and a severe-increasing class (4.4%) with high symptom levels that increased.High-risk injury victims can be identified by their daily PTSS, allowing for early identification of those at risk for elevated distress and in greater need for intervention.

The results of these studies have been heterogeneous, with researchers who used latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) tending to identify four trajectories and those who used group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) identifying five to seven trajectories. Given that no study has applied both GBTM and LGMM to their data, it remains unknown which modeling approach and what number of trajectories best fit post-9/11 PTSS data. The present study aimed to address that question by applying both LGMM and GBTM to data from the largest sample of survivors to date, comprising 37,545 New York City community members. When analyzing four waves of PTSS, reflecting participants' mental health up to 15 years post-9/11, LGMM fit the data better than GBTM. Our optimal solution consisted of four trajectories: low-stable (72.2% of the sample), decreasing (12.8%), increasing (9.5%), and high-stable (5.5%) symptoms. Covariate analyses indicated that economic factors (i.e., having a household income less than $25,000 and experiencing job loss due to 9/11) increased the odds of belonging to the high-stable symptom trajectory group to the greatest degree, ORs = 4.93-6.08.

However, such fluctuations are typically short ranged and have rarely been investigated over the course of decades after the trauma. Moreover, existing studies have used a variety of measurements, either employing a categorical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-oriented approach or a continuous measure of symptom severity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the two methods of analyzing trajectories of PTSD by examining the level of concordance between them, their sensitivity, and their validity. Method: A total of 349 Israeli veterans from the 1973 Yom Kippur War were examined at four time points over more than four decades since the war. A latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was conducted to identify different PTSD trajectories, using both categorical and continuous PTSD assessments. Results: Descriptive results revealed that the four commonly observed patterns of PTSD are insufficient for capturing the range of individual PTSD trajectories. Using a categorical measure in the explorative LCGA yielded three trajectories (resilient, chronic, and delayed onset). The continuous measure yielded five trajectories (resilient, chronic, recovered, and two delayed-onset trajectories), which provided a slightly more nuanced distinction of participants’ distress-induced psychosocial dysfunction as compared to the three-trajectory solution. Conclusion: These findings suggest that using a continuous PTSD trajectory measure provides a somewhat more sensitive estimation of PTSD trajectories. More specifically, taking into consideration symptom intensity and fluctuation over time may provide a more comprehensive picture of the survivors’ distress.",0.923838581

Youth exposed to disasters are at risk for developing posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, not all youth who report initially elevated PTSS report persistent PTSS that last beyond the first three to six months postdisaster. Thus, it is crucial to understand how and why youth differ in their patterns of PTSS. This study reviewed the literature on children's postdisaster PTSS, evaluating the typical number and types of patterns for children's PTSS trajectories, as well as risk and protective factors predicting trajectory membership. This review identified eight empirical studies on youth PTSS trajectories following natural disasters; these studies included 8,306 children aged 3 to 18 years. All studies identified resilience, recovery, and chronic trajectories. Evidence for a delayed trajectory was mixed. Proportions of children falling into each trajectory varied widely across studies, but overall, resilience was the most prevalent trajectory. These findings were consistent across study factors (i.e., analytic strategy, assessment timing, and study selection criteria). Female gender, disaster exposure, negative coping, and lack of social support were significant risk factors for chronic trajectories across several studies. Future research should combine individual level participant data across studies of children's responses to disasters to better understand PTSS trajectories.",0.923130961

PTSD symptoms related to a traumatic event during the most recent deployment were assessed in four annual waves in 2010–2013 among 682 Reserve Component soldiers. Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) was used to examine the longitudinal trajectories of PTSD symptoms. The association between the PTSD trajectories and suicidal ideation at waves 2 to 4 was examined in logistic regression analyses. Four trajectories were identified: resilience (73.0%), recovery (11.7%), late onset (11.6%) and chronic (3.6%). Pairwise comparisons demonstrated significant differences between trajectories in risk of suicidal ideation. Among the chronic trajectory group, 50.9% reported suicidal ideation (25.8% late onset group; 11.3% recovery group; 4.0% resilience group). After controlling for baseline characteristics, the late onset and chronic trajectory groups were more likely to have suicidal ideation than the resilience and recovery trajectories, respectively. Findings suggest the late onset and chronic trajectories of PTSD symptoms are associated with higher risk of suicidal ideation.

However, prior findings may not reflect the complete picture of distress postloss, because they were focused on depression symptoms following nonviolent death. We examined trajectories of symptom-levels of persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a disaster-bereaved sample. We also investigated associations among these trajectories and background and loss-related factors, psychological support, and previous mental health complaints. Methods Latent class growth modeling was used to identify distinct trajectories of PCBD, depression, and PTSD symptoms in people who lost loved ones in a plane disaster in 2014. Participants (N = 172) completed questionnaires for PCBD, depression, and PTSD at 11, 22, 31, and 42 months postdisaster. Associations among class membership and background and loss-related variables, psychological support, and previous mental health complaints were examined using logistic regression analyses. Results Two PCBD classes emerged: mild (81.8%) and chronic (18.2%) PCBD. For both depression and PTSD, three classes emerged: mild (85.6% and 85.2%), recovered (8.2% and 4.4%), and chronic trajectory (6.2% and 10.3%).

Trajectories of posttraumatic stress following a natural disaster,"The characteristics of long-term trajectories of distress after disasters are unclear, since few studies include a comparison group. This study examines trajectories of recovery among survivors in comparison to individuals with indirect exposure. Postal surveys were sent to Swedish tourists, repatriated from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami (n = 2268), at 1, 3, and 6 years after the tsunami to assess posttraumatic stress (PTS) and poor mental health. Items were used to ascertain high and moderate disaster exposure groups and an indirect exposure comparison group. Long-term PTS trajectories were best characterized by a resilient (72.3%), a severe chronic (4.6%), a moderate chronic (11.2%) and a recovering (11.9%) trajectory. Trajectories reported higher levels of PTS than the comparison group. Exposure severity and bereavement were highly influential risk factors. These findings have implications regarding anticipation of long-term psychological adjustment after natural disasters and need for interventions after a single traumatic event with few secondary stressors.",0.916300196

However, no clear consensus has been reached regarding the postdisaster trajectories of PTSD among children.Objective: The current study examined the trajectories of PTSD among children after exposure to the Wenchuan earthquake and explored potential predictors of distinct PTSD trajectories.Methods: A four-year longitudinal study was conducted to follow 301 children who were evaluated for PTSD symptoms following the Wenchuan earthquake. Trauma exposure and some pre-existing characteristics were measured at four months after the disaster, and PTSD symptoms were measured at 4, 16, 29, 40 and 52 months after the disaster. The trajectories were identified with Latent Growth Mixture Modelling, and the predictors were explored with multinomial logistic regression.Results: The following three latent PTSD trajectories were found among children: resilient (74.9%), relapsing (17.7%) and recovery (7.5%). Trauma exposure was more likely to be related to a more severe trajectory of PTSD, having experienced prequake trauma was more likely to be related to the recovery trajectory and school 2 was more likely to be related to the relapsing trajectory.Conclusion: These findings provide novel insights into children’s postdisaster response patterns. Individual heterogeneity existed in posttraumatic reactions. This longer-term longitudinal study captured more detailed and accurate information about the development of these trajectories.

We tracked PTSD symptoms among trauma-exposed individuals in the United States and sought to identify population-based variability in PTSD symptom trajectories and understand what, if any, early pandemic experiences predicted membership in one trajectory versus others. As part of a longitudinal study of U.S. residents during the pandemic, participants who reported at least one potentially traumatic experience in their lifetime (N = 1,206) at Wave 1 (April 2020) were included in the current study. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PCL-5 at four time points extending to July 2021. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify heterogeneous symptom trajectories. Trajectory membership was regressed on experiences from the early stage of the pandemic as measured using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory in a model that controlled for variables with documented associations to PTSD trajectories, including age, sex, income, and trauma history. Four trajectories were identified, categorized as resilient (73.0%), recurring (13.3%), recovering (8.3%), and chronic (5.5%). Emotional and physical health problems and positive changes associated with the early phase of the pandemic were each significant predictors of trajectory membership over and above all other variables in the model. Predictors primarily differentiated the resilient trajectory from each of the other three trajectories. Distinct PTSD symptom trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest a need for targeted efforts to help individuals at most risk for ongoing distress.",0.91012864

A total of 4487 rescue and recovery workers (1874 police and 2613 non-traditional responders) involved during and in the aftermath of the unprecedented World Trade Center (WTC) attacks, were assessed an average of 3, 6, 8, and 12 years post-9/11/2001. Among police responders, WTC-related PTSD symptoms were characterized by four trajectories, including no/low-symptom (76.1%), worsening (12.1%), improving (7.5%), and chronic (4.4%) trajectories. In non-traditional responders, a five-trajectory solution was optimal, with fewer responders in a no/low-symptom trajectory (55.5%), and the remainder in subtly worsening (19.3%), chronic (10.8%), improving (8.5%), and steeply worsening (5.9%) trajectories. Consistent factors associated with symptomatic PTSD trajectories across responder groups included Hispanic ethnicity, pre-9/11 psychiatric history, greater WTC exposure, greater medical illness burden, life stressors and post-9/11 traumas, and maladaptive coping (e.g., substance use, avoidance coping). Higher perceived preparedness, greater sense of purpose in life, and positive emotion-focused coping (e.g., positive reframing, acceptance) were negatively associated with symptomatic trajectories. Findings in this unique cohort indicate considerable heterogeneity in WTC-related PTSD symptom trajectories over 12 years post-9/11/2001, with lower rates of elevated PTSD symptoms in police than in non-traditional responders. They further provide a comprehensive risk prediction model of PTSD symptom trajectories, which can inform prevention, monitoring, and treatment efforts in WTC and other disaster responders.",0.91012519

The WTC Health Registry has followed up a large number of individuals, including police officers, at three waves of data collection from 2003 to 2011. This analysis examines the relationship between initial exposure levels, long-term PTSD symptoms, and subsequent emotional support among police responders.The study population included police responders who had reported their 9/11 exposure levels at Wave 1 (2003/4), provided three waves of data on PTSD symptoms using the 17-item PCL scale, and rated their received emotional support at Wave 3 (N = 2,204, 1,908 men, 296 women, mean age: 38 years at exposure). A second-order growth curve reflected a PTSD symptom trajectory which was embedded in a structural equation model, with exposure level specified as an exogenous predictor, and emotional support specified as an endogenous outcome.Exposure had a main effect on mean symptom levels (intercept) across three waves but it made no difference in changes in symptoms (slope), and no difference in emotional support. The symptom trajectory, on the other hand, had an effect on emotional support. Its intercept and slope were both related to support, indicating that changes in symptoms affected later emotional support.Initial trauma exposure levels can have a long-term effect on mean symptom levels.

The clinical course of PTSD varies between individuals, and patterns of symptom development have yet to be clearly delineated. Previous studies have been limited by convenience sampling, short follow-up periods, and the inability to account for combat-related trauma. To determine the trajectories of PTSD symptoms among deployed military personnel with and without combat exposure, we used data from a population-based representative sample of 8,178 US service members who participated in the Millennium Cohort Study from 2001 to 2011. Using latent growth mixture modeling, trajectories of PTSD symptoms were determined in the total sample, as well as in individuals with and without combat exposure, respectively. Overall, 4 trajectories of PTSD were characterized: resilient, pre-existing, new-onset, and moderate stable. Across all trajectories, combat-deployed service members diverged from non–combat-deployed service members, even after a single deployment. The former also generally had higher PTSD symptoms. Based on the models, nearly 90% of those without combat exposure remained resilient over the 10-year period, compared with 80% of those with combat exposure. Findings demonstrate that although the clinical course of PTSD symptoms shows heterogeneous patterns of development, combat exposure is uniformly associated with poor mental health.",0.905361263

However, few studies have tracked PTSS for more than a decade postdisaster, and none to our knowledge has explored the role of predisaster resources and vulnerabilities in shaping the likelihood of trajectory membership. The current study included participants from the Resilience in Survivors of Katrina Study (N = 885). Participants were originally part of a community college intervention study and were assessed prior to the hurricane (6–21 months predisaster), and approximately 1 year, 4 years, and 12 years postdisaster. Latent class growth analysis identified PTSS trajectories. Perceived social support, probable mental illness, and physical health conditions or problems–all assessed predisaster–were examined as predictors of trajectory membership at the univariate level and in multivariable models without and with adjustment for disaster exposure. Three PTSS trajectories were detected: Moderate-Decreasing (69.3%), High-Decreasing (23.1%), and High-Stable (7.6%). In the multivariable predictive model without adjustment for disaster exposure, probable predisaster mental illness was significantly associated with greater odds of the High-Decreasing and High-Stable trajectories, and physical health conditions or problems with greater odds of the High-Decreasing trajectory, relative to the Moderate-Decreasing trajectory. However, when disaster exposure was adjusted, only the association between predisaster mental illness and the odds of the High-Stable trajectory remained statistically significant. Lower predisaster perceived social support was significantly associated with membership in the High-Decreasing trajectory, relative to the Moderate-Decreasing, at the univariate level, but not in either multivariable model. Whereas predisaster mental illness confers risk for chronic postdisaster PTSS, other impacts of predisaster resources and vulnerabilities on elevated PTSS trajectories do not go beyond those of disaster exposure. The results support disaster preparedness efforts targeting those with mental and physical health conditions, and postdisaster mental health services addressing preexisting vulnerabilities in addition to disaster-related PTSS.",0.902641123

Four trajectories of PTSD symptoms were found, namely, resilience (53.8%), low symptoms (32.6%), recovery (7.0%), and chronic dysfunction (6.6%). Then, a logistic regression analysis that controlled for gender and grade showed that compared with the resilience group, children with an injury or probable acute stress disorder (ASD) were likely to be in the recovery group, children with probable ASD were more likely to be in the low-symptoms group, and children with a bad relationship with their father were more likely to be in the chronic group. The participants were selected by convenience principle. All children received an intervention after the earthquake. These findings suggest that increasing children's social support may relieve children's PTSD symptoms. We should consider both perceived threat and object exposure in future studies.

However, most studies focus on symptoms of psychiatric disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, depression), which are limited by heterogeneity and symptom overlap. We examined trajectories of cross-cutting posttraumatic symptom dimensions following traumatic injury and predictors of trajectory membership.In this longitudinal study of 427 predominantly Hispanic/Latino traumatic injury survivors, posttraumatic psychopathology symptoms were assessed during hospitalization and approximately one and five months post-trauma. Using latent class growth analysis, we estimated trajectories of several posttraumatic symptom dimensions: re-experiencing, avoidance, anxious arousal, numbing, dysphoric arousal, loss, and threat. We then examined sociodemographic and trauma-related characteristics (measured during hospitalization) as predictors of trajectory membership for each dimension.Four trajectories (Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset, Recovery) emerged for all dimensions except loss and threat, which manifested three trajectories (Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset). Across dimensions, membership in the Chronic (vs. Resilient) trajectory was consistently predicted by unemployment (7 of 7 dimensions), followed by older age (3/7), female sex (3/7), and assaultive trauma (2/7). For several dimensions, unemployment also distinguished between participants who presented with similar symptom levels days after trauma, but then diverged over time.Measures of posttraumatic symptom dimension constructs differed across assessments.This study provides evidence of distinct trajectories across transdiagnostic symptom dimensions after traumatic injury. Employment status emerged as the most important predictor of trajectory membership.

The initial data collection occurred approximately 16 months after the Hurricane, and participants were asked to participate again after 1‐ and 3‐month later. A result from the latent growth mixture modeling revealed that for PGI, the 4‐class model was the best‐fitting model, and for PTSS, the 3‐class model was the best‐fitting model. When examining the association between the trajectories of PGI and PSS, individuals classified to higher PGI subgroups were more likely to be associated with the Recovery PTSS subgroup.

Children and caregivers completed dispositional measures including optimism, positive or negative affect, and Five-Factor Inventories. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to identify latent trajectories of PTSS, and univariate logistic regression models were conducted to predict LCGA class membership from medical, demographic, and disposition factors Results: Very similar trajectories were observed in children and caregivers, with two-class solutions providing the best fit: a ""resilient"" class, with low PTSS at baseline, which declined significantly over time (83.5% in children; 71.5% in parents), and an ""elevated PTSS"" class, which was moderately high at baseline and increased significantly over time.

However, limited research has examined this phenomenon in relation to physical health. This study aims to determine how combat exposure relates to trajectories of physical health functioning in U.S. service members.MethodsThis study included 11,950 Millennium Cohort Study participants who had an index deployment between 2001 and 2005. Self-reported physical health functioning was obtained 5 times between 2001 and 2016 (analyzed in 2017), and latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify longitudinal trajectories from these assessments. Differences in the shape and prevalence of physical health functioning trajectories were investigated in relation to participants’ self-reported combat exposure over the index deployment.ResultsFive physical health functioning trajectories were identified (high-stable, delayed-declining, worsening, improving-worsening, and low-stable). Combat exposure did not influence the shape of trajectories (p=0.12) but did influence trajectory membership. Relative to personnel not exposed to combat, participants reporting combat exposure were more likely to be in the delayed-declining, worsening, and low-stable classes and less likely to be in the high-stable class. However, the high-stable class (i.e., the most optimal class) was the most common trajectory class among not exposed (73.0%) and combat-exposed (64.5%) personnel.ConclusionsCombat exposure during military deployment is associated with poorer physical health functioning trajectories spanning more than a decade of follow-up. However, even when exposed to combat, consistently high physical health functioning is the modal response.",0.895782644

However, little is known about how to predict which youths will develop chronic PTS symptoms after disaster exposure. <h3>Objective</h3> To evaluate PTS symptom trajectories among youths after 4 major US hurricanes and assess factors associated with those trajectories. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cohort study used integrative data analysis to combine data from 4 studies of youths’ responses to natural disasters (hurricanes Andrew [1992], Charley [2004], Ike [2005], and Katrina [2008]) at time points ranging from 3 to 26 months after the disasters. Those studies recruited and surveyed youths aged 6 to 16 years at schools via convenience sampling of schools near the path of destruction for each hurricane. This study was conducted from August 2017 to August 2020, and pooled data were analyzed from February 2019 to October 2020. <h3>Exposure</h3> Experience of a natural disaster during the ages of 6 to 16 years. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Posttraumatic stress symptoms were assessed using the University of California, Los Angeles, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (UCLA PTSD-RI) and the UCLA PTSD-RI-Revised. Latent class growth analyses were used to evaluate the youths’ PTS symptom trajectories and associated factors. <h3>Results</h3> Among 1707 youths included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 9.61 (1.60) years, 922 (54%) were female, and 785 (46%) self-identified as White non-Hispanic. Four PTS symptom trajectories were identified: chronic (171 participants [10%]), recovery (393 [23%]), moderate-stable (563 [33%]), and low-decreasing (580 [34%]). Older youths were less likely to be in the chronic group; compared with the chronic group, each 1-year increase in age was associated with increased odds of being in the other groups (recovery: odds ratio [OR], 1.78 [95% CI, 1.29-2.48]; moderate-stable: OR, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.43-2.62]; and low-decreasing: OR, 2.71 [95% CI, 1.99-3.71]).

Previous studies examining posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) trajectories have overlooked the co-existence of PTSD and PTG, making it difficult to accurately distinguish individuals with various posttraumatic presentations, causing the effects of targeted interventions to be discounted. To fill this gap, the current study sought to examine joint PTSD and PTG trajectories in children and adolescents. Eight hundred and seventy-six Chinese children and adolescents were recruited to complete self-report questionnaires 6, 12, and 18 months after the Ya'an earthquake. Multiple-process growth mixture modeling analysis was used to test the study proposal. Five distinct joint PTSD and PTG trajectory types were found: recovery, growth, struggling, resistant, and delayed symptoms. Female students and students who felt trapped or fearful were more likely to be in the struggling group, and students who experienced injury to themselves or family members were more likely to belong to the delayed symptom group. These findings suggest that postdisaster psychological services should be provided to relieve delayed symptoms in individuals who experience injury to themselves or their family members, and individuals in the struggling group should be supported to achieve growth.",0.890725225

One potential explanation for this variation is differing trajectories may be indicators of differing classes or levels of resilience to the stressor. Latent Class Trajectory (LCTA) and Growth Mixture models (GMM) are two similar approaches used to discover the number and types of trajectories in a study population. Class membership may determine the shape and level of recovery, which may be predicted by individual characteristics. In this talk, we present some insights to using these models to successfully identify the number of classes of trajectories, membership of trajectory classes, and the functional form of the trajectory. We will identify methods for deciding class enumeration, indices for assessing fit quality, and, importantly, the importance of proper model specification. Real life and simulated examples will be shown to compare and contrast differences between GMM and LCTA results. Part of a symposium sponsored by Epidemiology of Aging Interest Group.",0.890541945

In this study, we investigated trajectories of resilience and how these longitudinal patterns of resilience are related to changes in social relationships over time. Methods This longitudinal study analyzed 4,299 early adolescents from waves 3-6 (sixth year of elementary school to third year of middle school) of the Seoul Education Longitudinal Study (SELS). A latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was conducted to empirically demonstrate latent development trajectories of adolescentsâ resilience, and growth mixture model with known class was created to describe the relationship between resilience development trajectories and longitudinal change in social support systems (parent relationships, teacher relationships, peer relationships). Results First, the developmental patterns of adolescentsâ resilience varied over time; a total of six latent development trajectories were identified. The initial values of resilience by latent group were distributed over a wide range (high, middle-high, middle, middle-low, and low) and rate of change showed various patterns (decrease, decrease-increase, increase, and increase-decrease). Second, the patterns of change in social relationships (parents, teachers, peers) were similar to those of the resilience development trajectories. Third, among the three dimensions of social support, peer relationships showed the most similar patterns of change over time compared with other resilience development trajectories. Conclusions Based on the results of this study, differentiated interventions are required depending on the latent development trajectories of resilience, and adolescents should be provided with various opportunities to establish positive relationships with parents, teachers, and peers.

Objective To identify (predictors of) trajectories of PCBD, PTSD, and depression in disaster-bereaved people (study 1) and to examine temporal associations between PCBD, PTSD, and depression symptoms (study 2). Method In study 1, distress-trajectories were identified using latent class growth modelling. People (N = 172) whose significant other died due to MH17 disaster completed PCBD, PTSD, and depression questionnaires 11, 22, 31, and 42 months after the disaster. Predictors of trajectories were examined with logistic regression. In study 2, the same data were used to examine temporal associations between symptoms, using cross-lagged analysis. Results In study 1, a Mild (81.8%) and Chronic (18.2%) PCBD class emerged. For PTSD and depression we found a Mild (85.2% and 85.6%), Recovered (4.4% and 8.2%), and Chronic trajectory (10.3% and 6.2%). A lower educational level predicted chronic trajectories. In study 2, changes in PCBD symptoms had a greater impact on changes in PTSD and depression symptoms than vice versa. Conclusions In Study 1 we found support for differential trajectories and predictors across the outcomes, suggesting that different symptom-profiles post-loss may need different treatment approaches. Study 2’s findings run counter to the notion that PTSD and depression symptoms should be addressed before grief in treatment. We suggest that early screening and treatment of elevated grief is pivotal in preventing long-lasting distress.",0.884155589

We used Latent Class Growth Mixture Modeling (LCGMM) to identify subgroups of bereaved individuals sharing similar trajectories for each disorder. We used repeated measures ANOVA to evaluate differences in individual symptoms between trajectories. Finally, we investigated to what extent chronic trajectories of these three disorders co-occurred.Three trajectories of PG symptoms emerged: resilient (66.4%), chronic (25.1%) and acute recovery (8.4%). The overall severity and symptom profile of the acute recovery group were indistinguishable from that of the chronic group through 6 months post-bereavement, followed by reduction in PG from 6 to 18 months post-bereavement. Chronic PTS in the first-year post-bereavement tended to co-occur with chronic PG and/or chronic depression.Twenty five percent of those with initial elevations in grief recovered in the period of 6 to 12 months post-bereavement. These findings highlight the clinical importance of severe grief in the initial months following loss, but also suggests caution in diagnosing a grief disorder within the first-year post-bereavement.",0.88293786

This study examined longitudinal PTSS trajectories using latent growth mixture modeling in 2,355 World Trade Center (WTC) tower survivors surveyed by the WTC Health Registry an average of 2.5, 5.5, and 10.5 years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics, WTC‐related exposure, and other traumas/stressors. Four curvilinear PTSS trajectories were identified: low symptom (74.9%), recovering (8.0%), worsening (6.7%), and chronic (10.4%). The majority of WTC survivors (85.3%) maintained stable symptom trajectories over time, with PTSS changes occurring less often. Although WTC‐related exposure was associated with initial PTSS severity, exposure was not associated with chronicity or change of PTSS over time. Male gender and a higher number of post‐WTC disaster life‐stressors were associated with worsening symptom severity over time. Individuals with more severe hyperarousal symptoms at Wave 1, particularly of anxious arousal, were more likely to have PTSS that worsened over time, adjusted odds ratio (a OR ) = 1.55. Less severe emotional numbing symptoms, particularly of dysphoria, at Wave 1, were marginally significantly associated with subsequent PTSS recovery, a OR = 0.75. Interventions that target hyperarousal and emotional numbing symptoms may mitigate a worsening of symptoms and facilitate posttraumatic recovery following future mass traumas, such as terrorist attacks. Further clinical implications are discussed.",0.88254832

Military deployment can put soldiers at increased risk for developing PTSD symptoms. Longitudinal evaluations of PTSD symptoms in deployed military personnel are essential for mapping the long-term psychological burden of recent operations on our service members, and may improve current practice in veterans’ mental health care. Methods The current study examined PTSD symptoms and associated risk factors in a cohort of Dutch Afghanistan veterans 10 years after homecoming. Participants ( N = 963) were assessed seven times from predeployment up to 10 years after deployment. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify distinct trajectories of PTSD symptom development. Results The probable PTSD prevalence at 10 years after deployment was 8%. Previously identified risk factors like younger age, lower rank, more deployment stressors, and less social support were still relevant 10 years after deployment. Four trajectories of PTSD symptom development were identified: resilient (85%), improved (6%), severely elevated-recovering (2%), and delayed onset (7%). Only the delayed onset group reported increasing symptom levels between 5 and 10 years postdeployment, even though 77% reported seeking help. Conclusions This study provides insights into the long-term burden of deployment on the psychological health of military service members. It identifies a group of veterans with further increasing PTSD symptoms that does not seem to improve from currently available mental health support, and underlines the urgent need for developing and implementing alternative treatment opportunities for this group.",0.879677944

However, clergy may experience more depression than is observed in the general population, which may be due in part to high job strain. The objectives of this study were to identify distinct longitudinal trajectories of depressive symptoms in clergy and to identify variables associated with each course. The sample was 1172 clergy who were followed for up to 66 months. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), which was administered approximately every 6 months. Latent class trajectory analysis was conducted for group identification, and a 3-class trajectory model fit the data best. Class 1 (38% of the sample) had minimal or no depressive symptoms over time, class 2 (47%) had chronic mild symptoms, and class 3 (15%) had persistent moderate/severe symptoms. Occupational distress was significantly associated with trajectory class. The odds of being in either the chronic mild or the persistent moderate/severe depressive symptom class were significantly higher for those who were female, for those with fair/poor self-rated health, for those with more perceived financial or occupational stress, for those with lower levels of perceived emotional support, and/or for those with lower levels of spiritual well-being. The class exhibiting resilience to depressive symptoms had higher levels of perceived support and spiritual well-being as well as lower levels of perceived financial and occupational stress. A substantial percentage of clergy, and possibly people in similar helping occupations, may experience significant levels of depressive symptoms that do not remit over time. These individuals may benefit from treatments that address work-related coping.",0.877145133

Parent well‐being was based on parent depressive and anxiety symptoms and family resources (i.e., family mastery and social support). Methods Parents of 259 children with drug‐resistant epilepsy (105 of whom eventually had surgery) were recruited from eight epilepsy centers across Canada at the time of their evaluation for epilepsy surgery candidacy. Participants were assessed at baseline and 6‐month, 1‐year, and 2‐year follow‐up. The trajectories of parents' depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and family resources were jointly estimated using multigroup latent class growth models. Results The analyses identified three trajectories: an optimal‐stable group with no/minimal depressive or anxiety symptoms, and high family resources that remained stable over time; a mild‐decreasing‐plateau group with mild depressive and anxiety symptoms that decreased over time then plateaued, and intermediate family resources that remained stable; and a moderate‐decreasing group with moderate depressive and anxiety symptoms that decreased slightly, and low family resources that remained stable over time. Parents of children with higher health‐related quality of life, fathers, and parents who had higher household income were more likely to have better trajectories of well‐being. Treatment type was not associated with the trajectory groups, but parents whose children were seizure‐free at the time of the last follow‐up were more likely to have better trajectories (optimal‐stable or mild‐decreasing‐plateau trajectories). Significance This study documented distinct trajectories of parent well‐being, from the time of the child's evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Parents who present with anxiety and depressive symptoms and low family resources do not do well over time. They should be identified and offered supportive services early in their child's epilepsy treatment history.",0.875826104

Greater severity of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, specifically re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms, at baseline predicted Consistently Moderate and High and Increasing PTG trajectories. Compared to the Low and Decreasing PTG trajectory, the High and Increasing PTG trajectory scored higher on baseline measures of gratitude, purpose in life, Spirituality, and social support.Posttraumatic growth is a dynamic process with divergent trajectories.

However, in a Chinese trauma context, little research examined the long-term trajectories of these two symptoms with a gender perspective.Data came from an 8-year longitudinal survey of 3522 Wenchuan earthquake adult survivors. We used multilevel growth-curve models to investigate the trajectories of PTSS and depressive symptoms; adopted conditional growth-curve models to explore the gender differences in trajectories together with gendered factors associated with mental health symptoms; conducted Chow tests to examine the significance of gender differences. Standardized coefficients, P values, and effect sizes were reported.With covariates controlled, both linear (β = -1.33, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.79) and quadratic effects (β = 1.03, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.59) of time were significant in PTSS trajectory, whereas quadratic effect (β = 0.27, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.14) in the declining depressive trajectory was clinically nonsignificant. Compared with men, women are at higher risk of PTSS (β = 0.12, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.21) and depressive symptoms (β = 0.10, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.20), but also with a faster-declining rate in PTSS within first five years after the disaster. No gender difference was found regarding depressive trajectory. Additionally, poor education and income associate with more PTSS in women, while sickness predicts severer depression in women and more PTSS in men.This study proposes a gendered U-shape trajectory for PTSS and a declining depressive trajectory without gender difference. The findings of this study shed light on mental health intervention in future natural disasters.",0.872220241

To investigate the constancy of responses to cumulative trauma, stability and change in posttraumatic distress and resistance (as defined by no evidence of clinical symptoms) were assessed twice in 140 Israeli children and mothers exposed to continual rocket attacks over approximately 7 years, when the children were 2–4 (Time 1) and 9–11 years of age (Time 2). Measures included trauma exposure, posttraumatic and depressive symptoms, and child behavioral problems. We identified 4 longitudinal courses (LCs): resilient (resistance at Time 1 and Time 2), recovered (clinical distress at Time 1 and resistance at Time 2), developed symptoms (resistance at Time 1 and clinical distress at Time 2), and chronic distress (clinical distress at Time 1 and Time 2). Results showed more stability than change in the frequencies of resistance at both times of measurement. The resilient LC was the most common longitudinal course for both mothers and children.

The current study investigated trajectories of PTSD and depression among children after exposure to the Wenchuan earthquake and identified factors associated with PTSD or depression trajectories. Three hundred children who were exposed to the Wenchuan earthquake reported PTSD and depression symptoms 4, 16, 29, 40 and 52 months after the disaster, and potential predictors (age, earthquake exposure, prequake trauma and parental relationship) were identified. The PTSD and depression trajectories were identified with latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM), and the predictors were explored with multinomial logistic regression. Two depression trajectories emerged: resilient (66.2%) and chronic (33.8%). Three PTSD trajectories emerged: resilient (74.9%), recovery (7.5%) and relapsing (17.7%). Overall, 57.3% of the children had low depression and PTSD symptoms over four years. Depression trajectories were significantly predicted by age and parental relationship, while PTSD trajectories were significantly predicted by trauma exposure and prequake trauma experience. The children's prequake mental health statuses were unknown, and all assessments relied on self-report questionnaires. The postdisaster developmental course of depression was more stable than that of PTSD, and PTSD and depression had different risk factors. Previous studies that focus only on PTSD or depression trajectories may overestimate children's resilient responses. Longer-term postdisaster intervention should pay more attention to depression than to PTSD.",0.87185826

Using latent profile analysis, three classes of symptoms (resilient, thriving, and struggling) were identified at 8 and 20 months after the earthquake. Latent transition analysis indicated that the majority of survivors remained in the same class during the period, while others showed a transition between different classes over time. The transition was mainly characterized by three paths: from struggling to resilient, and from thriving to either resilient or struggling. Of the survivors who were classified as thriving at 8 months, those transitioning to the struggling class at 20 months were more likely to experience higher levels of loss and injury compared with those transitioning to the resilient class (Cohen's d = 0.72) or remaining in the thriving class (Cohen's d = 0.36) at 20 months postearthquake. Survivors who remained stable in the struggling class were older than those who remained stable in the thriving class (Cohen's d = 0.41) or those who moved from thriving at 8 months to resilient at 20 months after the earthquake (Cohen's d = 0.39).

However, because of the comorbidity of PTSD and depression, their mutual relationship affects their relative trajectories over time. Therefore, this study examined the joint trajectories of PTSD and depression and assessed their consistency over time. Using self-report questionnaires, we surveyed 303 children in the worst-affected area of the Ya’an earthquake at 6 months, 1 year, and 18 months post-disaster. Four latent joint trajectories of PTSD and depression were identified: a chronic depression-delayed PTSD symptoms group ( n = 59, 19.5%), a chronic PTSD-delayed depressive symptoms group ( n = 10, 3.3%), a low-symptoms group ( n = 208, 68.6%), and a chronic depression-PTSD symptoms recovery group ( n = 26, 8.6%). Companionship and affirmative value were more likely to be observed in the low-symptoms group.

Negative symptom trajectories were modelled using latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and predictors of trajectories examined using multinomial regression. Social recovery trajectories – also modelled using LCGA – of members of each negative symptom trajectory were ascertained and the relationship between negative symptom and social recovery trajectories examined. Four negative symptom trajectories were identified: Minimal Decreasing (63.9%), Mild Stable (13.5%), High Decreasing (17.1%) and High Stable (5.4%). Male gender and family history of non-affective psychosis predicted stably high negative symptoms. Poor premorbid adolescent adjustment, family history of non-affective psychosis and baseline depression predicted initially high but decreasing negative symptoms. Members of the Mild Stable, High Stable and High Decreasing classes were more likely to experience stably low functioning than the Minimal Decreasing class. Distinct negative symptom trajectories are evident in FEP. Only a small subgroup present with persistently high levels of negative symptoms. A substantial proportion of FEP patients with elevated negative symptoms at baseline will achieve remission of these symptoms within 12 months. However, elevated negative symptoms at baseline, whether or not they remit, are associated with poor social recovery, suggesting targeted interventions for service users with elevated baseline negative symptoms may help improve functional outcomes.",0.86378756

The course of depression among Latino children and adolescents, however, remains largely unexamined, along with family and cultural factors that can help explain dissimilar symptom paths. The present study used growth mixture modeling to map trajectories of depression symptoms and to examine youth and parent familism as predictors of these trajectories. Participants were 133 Latino 5th- to 7th-grade students (Mage = 12.4 years, SD = 0.91; 55.6% boys) and a subsample of their parents (n = 89). Youth reported on their depression symptoms at four time points, including two surveys (Time 1 and Time 3) and two in-person interviews (Time 2 and Time 4) over the course of 2 years. Familism reports were obtained from youth at Time 1 and from parents at Time 2. The trajectories identified include stable-low, recovery, and escalating, and only youth familism predicted membership in these trajectories. Relative to those in the recovery trajectory, youth reporting higher familism were more likely to belong to the stable-low trajectory. This study helps to highlight the heterogeneous course of depression among Latino youth and illustrates the importance of incorporating youth perspectives on family cultural values when considering their well-being.",0.862515925

Prior studies have shown that PTSD symptoms follow multiple trajectories in civilians and military personnel. The current study examines whether the trajectories of PTSD symptoms of veterans separated from the military are similar to continuously serving military personnel. The Millennium Cohort Study is a population-based study of military service members that commenced in 2001 with follow-up assessments occurring approximately every 3 years thereafter. PTSD symptoms were assessed at each time point using the PTSD Checklist. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to compare PTSD symptom trajectories between personnel who separated (veterans; n = 5292) and personnel who remained in military service (active duty; n = 16,788). Four distinct classes (resilient, delayed-onset, improving, and elevated-recovering) described PTSD symptoms trajectories in both veterans and active duty personnel. Trajectory shapes were qualitatively similar between active duty and veterans. However, within the resilient, improving, and elevated recovering classes, the shapes were statistically different. Although the low-symptom class was the most common in both groups (veterans: 82%; active duty: 87%), veterans were more likely to be classified in the other three classes (in all cases, p < 0.01). The shape of each trajectory was highly similar between the two groups despite differences in military and civilian life.",0.862407166

Risk and protective factors for depression trajectories, as well as associations with child outcomes were analyzed.This study included 283 mothers (age at time 1, M = 39.20 years, SD = 7.21; 62% African American). Mothers were assessed at four time points over two years following Hurricane Katrina. Mothers reported posttraumatic stress symptoms, hurricane exposure, traumatic life events, and social support at time 1. Depressive symptoms were modeled at times 2, 3, and 4. Youth reported their distress symptoms (posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety) at time 4.Latent class growth analyses identified three maternal depression trajectories among mothers exposed to Hurricane Katrina: low (61%), resilient (29%), and chronic (10%). Social support was identified as a protective factor among mothers.Three main trajectories of maternal depression following Hurricane Katrina were identified. Social support was protective for mothers. Identified trajectories were not associated with children's distress outcomes. These results have implications for disaster responses, screening efforts, and interventions targeted towards families. Future studies warrant the investigation of additional risk and protective factors that can affect maternal and child outcomes.",0.861666199

Methods We performed systematic searches of peer‐reviewed papers in English referenced in Pubmed, Embase, or PsycINFO and ascertained 34 prospective studies of PTSD symptom trajectories identified by latent class growth statistical modeling. Studies with delayed and low‐stable trajectories provided appropriate data for this study. We computed the difference between the delayed trajectory PTSD symptom sumscore and the low‐stable PTSD sumscore at the observed points in time after the traumatic event(s). Results In 29 study populations, the latent class growth analyses displayed delayed trajectories, and in these, we identified 110 data points (% PTSD sumscore difference/months since traumatic exposure). The median PTSD symptom sumscore was 25% higher during the initial 6 months among individuals in the delayed trajectory compared to those in low‐stable trajectory. From this level, the difference widened and reached a plateau of 40–50% higher. The variation was large, and the baseline participation rate and loss to follow‐up were exceeding 25% in the majority of the studies. Heterogeneity of populations, measures, and analyses precluded formal meta‐analysis. Conclusion Delayed PTSD is preceded by PTSD symptoms during the first year in most cases. Still, few individuals may experience an asymptomatic delay. The results underpin the rationale for monitoring PTSD symptoms and may inform forensic assessments in that delayed PTSD without symptoms bridging the traumatic event is rare.",0.8594672

Method Using latent growth mixture modeling and the ORANJ BOWL dataset, we examined prospective trajectories of depression among older adults (mean age, 60.67; SD, 6.86) who were exposed to the 2 events. We also collected community economic and criminal justice data to examine their impact upon depression trajectories. Participants (N=1172) were assessed at 3 times for affect, successful aging, and symptoms of depression. We additionally assessed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology after Hurricane Sandy. Results We identified 3 prospective trajectories of depression. The majority (83.6%) had no significant change in depression from before to after these events (resilience), while 7.2% of the sample increased in depression incrementally after each event (incremental depression). A third group (9.2%) went from high to low depression symptomology following the 2 events (depressive-improving). Only those in the incremental depression group had significant PTSD symptoms following Hurricane Sandy. Conclusion We identified a small group of individuals for whom the experience of multiple stressful events had an incremental negative effect on mental health outcomes. These results highlight the importance of understanding the perseveration of depression symptomology from one event to another.

There were 55.8% who were resistant to depression symptoms across the 4 years of study, and 41.5% who were resistant to PTS symptoms. There were 18.7% and 42.2% of participants who showed resilience (experiencing slightly elevated symptoms followed by a decline, according to Bonanno et al., 2002) to depression and PTS symptoms, respectively. Mild and chronic dysfunction constituted the smallest trajectory groups across disorders. Marital status, deployment to an area of conflict, and number of lifetime stressors were associated with membership into different latent groups for depression (unstandardized β estimates range = 0.69 to 1.37). Deployment to an area of conflict, number of lifetime traumatic events and education predicted membership into different latent groups for PTS (significant unstandardized β estimate range = 0.83 to 3.17). AUD was associated with an increase in both symptom outcomes (significant unstandardized β estimate range = 0.20 to 9.45).

So far, only few studies have employed such approaches in the study of maltreatment. The aim of the present study was to examine the impact of maltreatment-related variables on trajectories after maltreatment. Growth mixture modelling (GMM) was used to examine different trajectories of functioning in 206 children and adolescents (M = 9.8 years) with a history of child maltreatment. Trajectories were analyzed in regards to maltreatment characteristics and revictimization using multinomial logistic regression. The participants were followed up over a 12 months period including three assessments. Four trajectories were identified: resilient (22.9%), worsening (15.1%), recovering (32.2%), chronic (29.8%). Revictimization (OR: 2.6-5.5), a longer period between first and last reported incident of maltreatment (OR: 0.033 - 0.038) and consequently the age at first (OR: 0.039 - 0.054) and age at last reported incident (OR: 20.3-26.9) were significant predictors of a worsening functioning trajectory. Having experienced neglect predicted a worsening trajectory in contrast to a chronic and resilient trajectory (OR = 4.8-5.2). Findings suggest that a clinical follow-up of children with a history of maltreatment is crucial as this population represents a high risk sample. A worsening trajectory was closely associated with revictimization. Functioning trajectories seem to be directly linked to chronicity and timing of maltreatment. Implications are discussed.",0.855681203

The current study identified trajectories of depression and alcohol use problems and predictors of those trajectories across the deployment cycle.National Guard soldiers (N = 1973) and spouses/intimate partners (N = 1020) completed assessments of risk/protective factors and baseline measures of mental health functioning 2 to 5 months prior to soldiers' 1-year deployments (Time 1) to Kuwait/Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn or Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Partners' mental health was reassessed at 4 months (Time 2) and 8 months (Time 3) after soldiers deployed, and both spouses/partners and soldiers were reassessed 2-3 months postdeployment (Time 4).Latent class growth modeling of partner depression symptoms over time revealed 4 groups: Resilience (79.9%), Deployment Distress (8.9%), Anticipatory Distress (8.4%), and Post-Deployment Distress (2.7%). Three alcohol misuse trajectories were identified: Resilience (91.3%), Deployment Onset (5.4%), and Deployment Desistance (3.3%). Predeployment predictors of partners' depression symptom trajectories varied by group and included soldier reports of stressors and social support and partner levels of neuroticism, introversion, disconstraint, and reported stressors. Predeployment predictors of alcohol misuse trajectories varied by group, and included soldier levels of alcohol misuse as well as partner neuroticism, disconstraint, and family readiness.Delineating and predicting trajectories of partner adjustment can allow for better targeted interventions toward those most at risk for heightened distress or alcohol problems over the deployment cycle.

Family caregiver posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were measured using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised at four time points: at enrollment, shortly after ICU discharge, and at 3 and 6 months after ICU discharge. The data were examined using latent class growth analysis to identify posttraumatic stress disorder symptom trajectories. Two distinct symptom trajectories were identified: a persistently high trajectory, characterized by high posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms at initial assessment, which remained elevated over time, and a persistently low trajectory, characterized by low posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms at initial assessment, which remained low over time. Approximately two-thirds of caregivers belonged to the persistently high trajectory, and one-third of caregivers belonged to the persistently low trajectory.Using latent class growth analysis to measure 6-month ICU family caregiver posttraumatic stress disorder symptom trajectories, we identified two distinct trajectories (persistently low and persistently high).

Currently, there is a limited understanding of how children's resilience changes over time after experiencing maltreatment, especially for young children. Therefore, the current study used a longitudinal, multidimensional approach to examine trajectories of resilience among very young children involved in child protective services and determine whether placement setting and caregiving behaviors are associated with resilience trajectories. This study used data from National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being I and conducted repeated measures latent class analysis, focusing on children under 2 years old at baseline (n = 1,699). Results suggested that there were three trajectories of resilience: increasing resilience, decreasing resilience, and stable, low resilience.

Understanding their relationship is of clinical and theoretical importance. A comprehensive way to understand post-trauma psychopathology is through symptom trajectories. This study aims to look at the developmental courses of PTSD and depression symptoms and their interrelationship in the initial months post-trauma in children and adolescents.Two-hundred-and-seventeen children and adolescents aged between eight and 17 exposed to single-event trauma were included in the study. Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and depression symptoms were measured at 2 weeks, 2 months and 9 months, with further psychological variables measured at the 2-week assessment. Group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM) was applied to estimate the latent developmental clusters of the two outcomes. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors associated with high symptom groups.The GBTM yielded a three-group model for PTSS and a three-group model for depression. PTSS trajectories showed symptoms reduced to a non-clinical level by 9 months for all participants (if they were not already in the non-clinical range): participants were observed to be resilient (42.4%) or recovered within 2 months (35.6%), while 21.9% experienced high level PTSS but recovered by 9 months post-trauma. The depression symptom trajectories predicted a chronic non-recovery group (20.1%) and two mild symptom groups (45.9%, 34.0%). Further analysis showed high synchronicity between PTSS and depression groups. Peri-event panic, negative appraisals, rumination and thought suppression at 2 weeks predicted slow recovery from PTSS. Pre-trauma wellbeing, post-trauma anxiety and negative appraisals predicted chronic depression.Post-trauma depression was more persistent than PTSS at 9 months in the sampled population. Cognitive appraisal was the shared risk factor to high symptom groups of both PTSS and depression.Objetivo: El trastorno de estrés postraumático y la depresión tienen una alta comorbilidad. Comprender su relación es de importancia clínica y teórica. Una forma integral de comprender la psicopatología postraumática es a través de las trayectorias de los síntomas. Este estudio tiene como objetivo observar los cursos de desarrollo del TEPT y los síntomas de depresión y su interrelación en los primeros meses posteriores al trauma en niños/ñas y adolescentes.Métodos: Se incluyeron en el estudio 217 niños/ñas y adolescentes de ocho a diecisiete años expuestos a un evento traumático único. Los síntomas de estrés postraumático (SEPT) y los síntomas de depresión se midieron a las 2 semanas, 2 meses y 9 meses, con otras variables psicológicas medidas en la evaluación de 2 semanas. Se aplicó un modelo de trayectoria basado en grupos (MTBG) para estimar los grupos de desarrollo latentes de los dos resultados. Se utilizó la regresión logística para identificar predictores asociados con grupos de síntomas elevados.Resultados: El MTBG arrojó un modelo de tres grupos para SEPT y un modelo de tres grupos para depresión. Las trayectorias de SEPT mostraron síntomas reducidos a un nivel no clínico en 9 meses para todos los participantes (si ellos aún no estaban en el rango no clínico): se observó que los participantes eran resilientes (42,4%) o se recuperaron en 2 meses (35,6%), mientras que el 21,9% experimentó un SEPT de alto nivel pero se recuperó a los 9 meses después del trauma. Las trayectorias de los síntomas de depresión predijeron un grupo crónico de no-recuperación (20,1%) y dos grupos de síntomas leves (45,9%, 34,0%). Un análisis posterior mostró una alta sincronicidad entre los grupos de SEPT y depresión. El pánico peri-evento, las evaluaciones negativas, la rumiación y la supresión del pensamiento a las 2 semanas predijeron una recuperación lenta del SEPT. El bienestar pre-traumático, la ansiedad post-traumática y las valoraciones negativas predijeron la depresión crónica.Conclusiones: La depresión post-traumática fue más persistente que el SEPT a los 9 meses en la población muestreada.

Identifying distinct course trajectories and predictors of those trajectories may help refine treatment approaches.This study examined the longitudinal course of mood symptoms and functioning ratings in 126 youth at high risk for BD based on family history and early mood symptoms. Participants were enrolled in a randomized trial of family-focused therapy and followed longitudinally (mean 2.0 years, SD = 53.6 weeks).Using latent class growth analyses (LCGA), we observed three mood trajectories. All youth started the study with active mood symptoms. Following the index mood episode, participants were classified as having a ""significantly improving course"" (n = 41, 32.5% of sample), a ""moderately symptomatic course"" (n = 21, 16.7%), or a ""predominantly symptomatic course"" (n = 64, 50.8%) at follow-up. More severe depression, anxiety, and suicidality at the study's baseline were associated with a poorer course of illness. LCGA also revealed three trajectories of global functioning that closely corresponded to symptom trajectories; however, fewer youth exhibited functional recovery than exhibited symptomatic recovery.Mood trajectories were assessed within the context of a treatment trial. Ratings of mood and functioning were based on retrospective recall.This study suggests considerable heterogeneity in the course trajectories of youth at high risk for BD, with a significant proportion (32.5%) showing long-term remission of symptoms.

Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to identify trajectories of grief and a multinomial regression analysis was conducted to examine predictors of class membership. Results: The analysis identified three grief trajectories; moderate/decreasing class (23%), high/slow decreasing class (64%), and a high/chronic class (13%). Predictors of high/slow recovery or chronic grief was female gender, previous depressive symptoms, and intrusion and avoidance symptoms. Conclusion: The findings highlights the difficult grief process and slow recovery that characterizes the majority of close family members bereaved by a terror-incident.

Baseline assessment (T0) data were collected before surgery and included demographic, biological (clinical characteristics), psychological (psychological resilience, self-efficacy, psychological distress, hope, medical coping mode) and social (social support) factors. Resilience measurements were repeated at 3 days after surgery (T1), the date of discharge (T2), and 1 month (T3) and 3 months (T4) after discharge. Latent growth mixture modelling was employed to define different resilience trajectories. Predictors of class membership were identified using multinomial logistic regression.Data from 198 patients were analysed. Three latent classes were identified with similar patterns in different intercepts, showing a significant decrease in resilience from admission (T0) to 3 days after surgery (T1) followed by an increase from T1 to T4. The three trajectories of psychological resilience were named the stable-resilience class (65.66%), high-resilience class (17.68%), and low-resilience class (16.66%). Multinomial logistic regression showed that compared with the stable-resilience class, the high-resilience class was predicted by having a higher level of hope, having higher education, living in urban areas and having more children, while the low-resilience class was predicted by having lower levels of self-efficacy and hope, living in semirural areas, and having more children.The three trajectories indicated that surgery was the major stressor influencing patients' psychological resilience and that patients in the low-resilience class needed to be intervened.Predictors of patients in different classes provide evidence for the identification of vulnerable populations and lay a foundation for future research contributing to the development of targeted interventions for improving patients' psychological resilience. No patient or public contribution but the time points of investigation were decided based on our interviews with 12 total knee arthroplasty patients.",0.847807379

The primary aim of the present study was to distinguish patterns of chronically elevated levels of depressive symptoms v. trajectories that are either elevated during pregnancy but then remit after childbirth, v. patterns that increase after childbirth. Methods The report uses latent growth mixture modeling in a large, population-based cohort ( N = 12 121) to investigate temporal patterns of depressive symptoms. We examined theoretically relevant sociodemographic factors, exposure to adversity, and offspring gender as predictors. Results Four distinct trajectories emerged, including resilient (74.3%), improving (9.2%), emergent (4.0%), and chronic (11.5%). Lower maternal and paternal education distinguished chronic from resilient depressive trajectories, whereas higher maternal and partner education, and female offspring gender, distinguished the emergent trajectory from the chronic trajectory. Younger maternal age distinguished the improving group from the resilient group. Exposure to medical, interpersonal, financial, and housing adversity predicted membership in the chronic , emergent , and improving trajectories compared with the resilient trajectory. Finally, exposure to medical, interpersonal, and financial adversity was associated with the chronic v . improving group, and inversely related to the emergent class relative to the improving group. Conclusions There are distinct temporal patterns of depressive symptoms during pregnancy, after childbirth, and beyond. Most women show stable low levels of depressive symptoms, while emergent and chronic depression patterns are separable with distinct correlates, most notably maternal age, education levels, adversity exposure, and child gender.",0.8476597

Within groups, higher PCL scores were associated with adverse social circumstances including lower social support, with B coefficients ranging from 0.2 to 0.6, divorce, separation, or widowhood (range = 0.4–0.7), and unemployment (range = 0.4–0.5). Given baseline, exposure‐related, and contextual influences that affect divergent PTSD trajectories, screening for both PTSD and adverse circumstances should occur immediately, and at regular intervals postdisaster.",0.846313756

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represented an unheralded opportunity to better understand heterogeneous trajectories of PTSD symptoms across a prolonged period of social disruption and stress. We tracked the PTSD symptoms of trauma-exposed individuals in the U.S., sought to identify population-based variability in PTSD symptom trajectories, and understand what, if any, early pandemic experiences would predict their membership in one trajectory over others. As part of a large-scale longitudinal study of U.S. residents during the pandemic, participants who reported at least one potentially traumatic event in their lifetime (N = 1206) at Wave 1 (April 2020) were included in the current study. PTSD symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 at four time points extending to July 2021. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify heterogeneous symptom trajectories. Trajectory membership was regressed on baseline demographics and experiences from the early stage of the pandemic as measured by the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory. Four trajectories (Resilient [73%], Recurring [13.3%], Recovering [8.3%], and Chronic [5.5%] were identified. Age, trauma load, and early pandemic experiences (emotional/physical health problems and positive changes) were each significant predictors of trajectory membership. Predictors primarily differentiated the Resilient from each of the other three trajectories. Distinct PTSD symptom trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic point to the need for targeted efforts helping those at most risk for ongoing distress.",0.846151795

A considerable part of them suffers from long-term sequelae, also known as post-intensive care syndrome. Among these, depressive symptoms are frequently observed. Depressive symptom trajectories and associated factors of critical illness survivors have rarely been investigated. Study objective was to explore and compare different trajectories of depressive symptoms in sepsis survivors over 1 year after discharge from ICU. Methods Data of a randomized controlled trial on long-term post-sepsis care were analyzed post hoc. Depressive symptoms were collected at 1, 6 and 12 months post-ICU discharge using the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), among others. Statistical analyses comprised descriptive analysis, univariate and multivariate, linear and logistic regression models and Growth Mixture Modeling. Results A total of 224 patients were included into this analysis. We identified three latent classes of depressive symptom trajectories: Over the course of 1 year, 152 patients recovered from mild symptoms, 27 patients showed severe persistent symptoms, and 45 patients recovered from severe symptoms. MDI sum scores significantly differed between the three classes of depressive symptom trajectories at 1 and 6 months after ICU discharge ( p &lt; 0.024 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Compared with other classes, patients with the mild recovered trajectory showed lower levels of chronic pain (median sum score of 43.3 vs. 60.0/53.3 on the Graded Chronic Pain Scale, p &lt; 0.010) and posttraumatic stress (4.6% with a sum score of ≥ 35 on the Posttraumatic Stress Scale 10 vs. 48.1%/33.3%, p &lt; 0.003); and higher levels of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the Short Form-36 scale within 1 month after ICU discharge ( p &lt; 0.035). Conclusions In the first year after discharge from ICU, sepsis survivors showed three different trajectories of depressive symptoms. Course and severity of depressive symptoms were associated with chronic pain, posttraumatic stress and reduced HRQOL at discharge from ICU. Regular screening of sepsis survivors on symptoms of depression, chronic pain and posttraumatic stress within 1 year after ICU may be considered. Trial registration ISRCTN, ISRCTN 61744782.

We examined PTSD symptoms in a cohort of U.S. Marines (N = 892) recruited for the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS). Marines deployed as one battalion infantry unit to Afghanistan in 2010 and were assessed pre-deployment and one, five, and eight months post-deployment. We employed latent transition analysis (LTA) to examine Marines' movement across PTSD symptom profiles, determined by latent class analysis (LCA). LCAs revealed a 3-class solution one month pre-deployment, a 4-class solution at five months post-deployment, and a 3-class solution at eight months post-deployment. LTA revealed notable movement between classes over time, which depended chiefly on pre-deployment symptom presentation. Marines who reported few pre-deployment symptoms either maintained these low levels or returned to low levels by eight months. Marines who reported a moderate number of symptoms at pre-deployment had variable outcomes; 50% had reductions by eight months, and those who reported numbing symptoms at five months post-deployment tended to report more symptoms at eight months. Marines who reported more PTSD symptoms prior to deployment retained more symptoms eight months post-deployment. Combat exposure and post-deployment stressor exposure predicted profile transitions. Examining transitions between latent class membership over time revealed prognostic information about Marines' eight-month PTSD outcomes. The extent of pre-deployment PTSD symptoms was particularly informative of likely PTSD outcomes.",0.844491494

The present study examined trends in distress and recovery in the aftermath of COVID-19 in China. Predictors that might increase risks or provide protections again distress were explored. Participants were recruited using social media during the COVID-19 pandemic to complete a baseline and 6-week follow-up survey (N = 241). The change patterns of PTSD symptoms from baseline to follow-up were characterized using latent class growth analysis (LCGA). A repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to explore the differences in the depressive symptoms across trajectory groups. Multinominal logistic regression was performed to investigate potential predictors of the outcome trajectories. Four longitudinal outcome trajectories were identified: chronic (PTSD symptoms remained high; 14.9%), resilient (symptoms remained low; 43.2%), recovered (symptoms decreased from symptomatic levels to asymptomatic; 19.5%), and delayed (symptoms increased from asymptomatic levels to symptomatic; 22.4%). Hopelessness and maladaptive coping strategies were unique predictors of distress and resilience as well as longer-term trajectories. Individuals evidenced four outcome trajectories of distress in the aftermath of COVID-19 in China.

For this, this study used panel data from the Disaster Victim Panel Survey (wave 1-4) conducted by the National Disaster Management Research Institute, and classified trajectory types of posttraumatic stress disorder using latent class growth analysis. In addition, multinominal logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine socio-demographic, disaster victim, and social capital factors associated with latent groups. The main results are as follows. First, according to the trajectory of posttraumatic stress disorder among disaster victims, the latent groups were classified into three groups, which includes low-risk group (74.2%), moderate-risk group (20.4%), and high-risk group (5.5%). Second, the more level of social solidarity as one of social capital, the study participants were likely to be in a low-risk group rather than a high-risk group or a moderate-risk group. Third, the more having damage of human life, the study participants tended to be in a high-risk group than a low-risk group. Fourth, the worse the subjective health prior to the disaster, the study participants were likely to be in a moderate-risk group than a low-risk group. Based on these results, the study discussed social welfare practice and policy implications for prevention and intervention of posttaumatic stress disorder among disaster victims.",0.844243789

While mutual maintenance between pain and PTSD has been suggested, knowledge on individual differences in the course of these symptoms is needed. The present study aimed to identify trajectories of PTSD symptoms following whiplash and test predictors and functional outcomes of such trajectories. Methods In a prospective cohort design with assessments at baseline (&lt;4 weeks), 3 months, and 6 months post‐injury ( n = 229, whiplash grade I‐ III ), we identified PTSD ‐trajectories using Latent Growth Mixture Modeling. Predictors (pain, fear‐avoidance‐beliefs, pain‐catastrophizing, depression, age, and gender) were tested using multinomial logistic regression, and group mean differences in physical and psychosocial pain‐related disability at 6 months were tested as outcomes after controlling for baseline levels. Results Three trajectories were identified: “Resilient” (75.1%) with little or no PTSD symptoms over time, “Recovering” (10.0%) with high initial PTSD symptom levels, then decreasing substantially, and “Chronic” (14.9%) with high initial PTSD symptom levels and a small increase over time. Initial higher pain and depression levels predicted the recovering and chronic trajectories, while the latter had more pain‐related disability at 6 months compared to both other trajectories. Conclusions Three trajectories were identified, with the chronic trajectory suggesting that a significant subset of people does not recover from PTSD symptoms. This class also reported more pain‐related disability. Pain and depression predicted membership, but did, however, not succeed in differentiating between the two high‐starting trajectories, suggesting that targeting PTSD symptoms may be important to ensure recovery. Significance Distinct recovery patterns after whiplash were identified with a significant subgroup reporting elevated and slightly increasing PTSD symptoms over time, highlighting both recovery variability and the presence of PTSD symptoms in a significant subgroup of individuals with whiplash. This subgroup also displayed enhanced pain‐related disability over time compared to the recovering and resilient subgroups, thereby linking PTSD symptoms to functional pain outcomes over time. These findings suggest that clinicians should be attentive of potential PTSD symptoms in whiplash patients.",0.84184001

The trajectory of symptoms in the period of time immediately following the trauma (the acute post-trauma period) may be important in determining which individuals develop PTSD. The current study examined trajectories of PTSD symptom severity across the acute post-trauma period and if membership in these trajectories was predictive of PTSD symptom severity, depression symptoms, and functional impairment 1- and 3-months post-trauma. Four trajectories were identified: low and decreasing, rapid decreasing, slow decreasing, and consistently high. Further, trajectory membership in the acute post-trauma period was found to predict differences in PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, and functional impairment severity at both 1- and 3- months post-trauma. These findings highlight a relationship between PTSD symptoms during the acute post-trauma period and later impairment.",0.840771595

This study aimed to identify discrete trajectories of positive, negative and general psychopathological symptoms and functioning, determine predictors of the identified symptom trajectories and subsequently investigate the relationship between symptom and functioning trajectories over the 2-year follow-up period.Data were extracted from the Singapore Early Psychosis Intervention Programme clinical database. Trajectories of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale over the two-year follow up were modelled using latent class growth curve modelling.Two distinct trajectories (early response and stable trajectory and delayed response trajectory) for positive symptoms, four distinct trajectories (early response and stable trajectory, early response and relapse trajectory, slower response and no response trajectory and delayed response trajectory) for negative and general psychopathology symptoms and three distinct trajectories for functioning (high functioning trajectory, moderately stable functioning trajectory and deterioration in functioning trajectory) were identified in our sample. Compared to individuals in the early response and stable trajectory, those in the delayed response trajectory for positive and negative symptoms, early response and relapse for negative and general psychopathology symptoms and slower response and no response trajectories for general psychopathology symptoms were significantly associated with higher odds of having deterioration in functioning over time. Poor symptom trajectories were also significantly predicted by younger age, male gender, unemployed and economically inactive status, lower education, longer duration of untreated psychosis and diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum and delusional disorders.The results confirm that the symptoms trajectories among patients with FEP are heterogeneous and suggest that a small group of patients may be at higher risk of deterioration in symptom severity and functioning over the 2-year follow-up.",0.840108308

Growth mixture modeling assessed for trajectories of treatment response across pre-, mid-, and posttreatment and 1-year follow-up. Pretreatment client demographic and clinical traits and treatment modality (individual- and family-based CBT) were examined as predictors of trajectory classes.Growth mixture modeling supported three trajectory classes based on parent-reported symptoms: steady responders, rapid responders, and delayed improvement. A 4-class model was supported for youth-reported symptoms: steady responders, rapid responders, delayed improvement, and low-symptom responders. Delayed improvement classes were predicted by higher number of diagnoses (parent and youth report). Receiving family CBT predicted membership in the delayed improvement class compared to all other classes and membership in the steady responder class compared with rapid responders (youth report). Rapid responders were predicted by older age (parent report) and higher number of diagnoses (parent report).

Studies of longitudinal psychological distress among those exposed to trauma have been limited to relatively short durations of follow-up among smaller samples. Methods The current study longitudinally assessed heterogeneity in trajectories of psychological distress among WTC Health Registry enrollees – a prospective cohort health study of responders, students, employees, passersby, and residents in the affected area ( N = 30 839) – throughout a 15-year period following the WTC disaster. Rescue/recovery status and exposure to traumatic events of 9/11, as well as sociodemographic factors and health status, were assessed as risk factors for trajectories of psychological distress. Results Five psychological distress trajectory groups were found: none-stable, low-stable, moderate-increasing, moderate-decreasing, and high-stable. Of the study sample, 78.2% were classified as belonging to the none-stable or low-stable groups. Female sex, being younger at the time of 9/11, lower education and income were associated with a higher probability of being in a greater distress trajectory group relative to the none-stable group. Greater exposure to traumatic events of 9/11 was associated with a higher probability of a greater distress trajectory, and community members (passerby, residents, and employees) were more likely to be in greater distress trajectory groups – especially in the moderate-increasing [odds ratios (OR) 2.31 (1.97–2.72)] and high-stable groups [OR 2.37 (1.81–3.09)] – compared to the none-stable group.

This study investigated trajectories of psychiatric symptoms and their relationships with different patterns of changes in personal, social, and financial resources between 2020 and 2022 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A population-representative sample (N = 1333) was recruited to complete self-report instruments at the pandemic's acute phase (February-July 2020, T1), and again at 1-year (March-August 2021, T2) and 1.5-year (September 2021-February 2022, T3) follow-ups. Respondents reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, self-efficacy, perceived social support, and financial capacity. Growth mixture modeling (GMM) identified four trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms: resilience (72.39-74.19%), recovery (8.40-11.93%), delayed distress (7.20-7.35%), and chronic distress (8.33-10.20%). Four patterns were demonstrated in resource changes: persistent high resources (40.89-47.64%), resource gain (12.08-15.60%), resource loss (6.30-10.43%), and persistent low resources (28.73-36.61%). Loss and gain in financial resources characterized chronic distress and resilience, respectively. Loss in personal resources characterized delayed distress, whereas loss or no gain in social resources was related to chronic/delayed distress. Respondents in resilience were also more likely to have persistent high resources while those with delayed/chronic distress were more likely to have persistent low resources. These results provide an initial evidence base for advancing current understanding on trajectories of resilience and psychopathology in the context of resource changes during and after large-scale disasters.",0.838901646

Cross-sectional studies find DD is strongly correlated with poor diabetes management, however little is known about the pattern of change of DD symptoms over long periods of time. We sought to identify and describe a set of distinct longitudinal trajectories of DD over 4 years of follow-up time.We used data derived from the Evaluation of Diabetes Treatment study (2011-2014), a longitudinal community-based survey of Canadian adults (40-75 years) with type 2 diabetes (n=1135). To determine the number and shape of trajectories, we used a latent class growth modeling approach.Five distinct trajectories of DD were identified. Trajectories 1 and 2 comprised participants with persistently low (61%) or persistently low, but at risk (22%) levels of distress. Trajectory 3 (7.5%) included participants with decreasing moderate levels of distress. Trajectory 4 (6.5%) consisted of participants with increasing moderate levels of distress. Trajectory 5 (2.4%) included participants with persistently severe levels of distress.Different populations may produce different DD trajectories and thus the generalizability of the strata identified in this report remains to be investigated. Future research is needed to determine the extent to which time-varying covariates might alter the path of DD trajectories.For most individuals, DD is a fairly stable condition over 4 years of follow-up time.

Methods We used the American National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Child/Young Adult (n = 6,315) and the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (n = 3,666). Depressive symptoms were measured using five items from the Center for Epidemiological Studies on Depression scale. Latent trajectories of depressive symptoms from ages 16–25 years were identified using growth mixture models. We estimated the effect of childhood family income, parental education, and parental unemployment on trajectory membership using multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variances. Results We identified four similar trajectories in the two countries: (1) low stable; (2) mid-peak; (3) increasing; and (4) decreasing. Relatively more Americans were in the low-stable trajectory group than Canadians (77.6% vs. 64.9%), and fewer Americans were in the decreasing group (7.1% vs. 19.1%). In the U.S., childhood family income in the bottom two quartiles was related to higher rates of increasing trajectory membership compared with income in the top quartile (incidence rate ratios: 1.59–1.79, p < .05), but not in Canada. In the U.S., parental education at a high school level was associated with higher rates of decreasing trajectory membership compared with higher education (incidence rate ratio = 1.45, confidence interval: 1.10–1.91; p = .01), but not in Canada. Conclusions Depressive symptoms may take a similar course in the transition to adulthood within these two countries.

Little is known about the course of depression after TBI. Participants were 559 consecutively admitted patients with mild to severe TBI recruited from inpatient units at Harborview Medical Center, a Level I trauma center in Seattle, WA. Participants were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depression measure at months 1–6, 8, 10, and 12 post-injury. We used linear latent class growth mixture modeling (LCGMM) of PHQ-9 total scores to identify homogeneous subgroups with distinct longitudinal trajectories. A four-class LCGMM had good fit indices and clinical interpretability. Trajectory groups were: low depression (70.1%), delayed depression (13.2%), depression recovery (10.4%), and persistent depression (6.3%). Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to distinguish trajectory classes based on baseline demographic, psychiatric history, and clinical variables. Relative to the low depression group, the other three groups were consistently more likely to have a pre-injury history of other mental health disorders or major depressive disorder, a positive toxicology screen for cocaine or amphetamines at the time of injury, and a history of alcohol dependence. They were less likely to be on Medicare versus commercial insurance. Trajectories based on LCGMM are an empirical and clinically meaningful way to characterize distinct courses of depression after TBI. When combined with baseline predictors, this line of research may improve our ability to predict prognosis and target groups who may benefit from treatment or secondary prevention efforts (e.g., proactive telephone counseling).",0.835350023

Symptom toxicity often results in complications, treatment delays, and therapy dose reductions that can compromise leukemia therapy and jeopardize chances for long-term survival. Critical to understanding symptom experiences during treatment is the need for exploration of ""why"" inter-individual symptom differences occur; this will determine who may be most susceptible to treatment toxicities.This study examined specific symptom trajectories during the first 18 months of childhood leukemia treatment. Symptom measures included fatigue, sleep disturbances, pain, nausea, and depression.Symptom trajectories of 236 children with leukemia three to 18 years old were explored prospectively over four periods: initiation of post-induction therapy, four and eight post-induction therapy, and the last time point was at the beginning of maintenance/continuation therapy. Latent class growth analysis was used to classify patients into distinctive groups with similar symptom trajectories based on patients' response patterns on the symptom measures over time.Three latent classes of symptom trajectories were identified and classified into mild, moderate, and severe symptom trajectories. The only demographic characteristic with a significant relationship to membership in the latent class symptom trajectories was race/ethnicity.

Results demonstrated a class of women with ""low risk"" (88.8%) who manifested low levels of depression and high levels of PSE during the postpartum period; a second group of women, labeled ""early risk"" (6.3%) with high levels of depression that decreased over time but lower levels of PSE that remained fairly stable; and a final trajectory group deemed the ""late-risk"" class (4.9%) with initially low levels of depression and high levels of PSE that significantly increased and decreased, respectively, over the period. Early childhood trauma, parenting stress, and poor parenting practices were associated membership in a high-risk class. Mothers in the high-risk groups reported children with more aggressive and defiant behavior at age 3. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for developing effective and sensitive interventions.La depresión posterior al parto y la autoeficacia de los padres (PSE) son factores de riesgo para la débil conducta del niño. Poco se sabe, sin embargo, acerca del curso de las trayectorias duales de síntomas depresivos que ocurren simultáneamente y PSE o su impacto en el desarrollo socioemocional de los niños. Este estudio se propuso identificar las trayectorias del PSE posterior al parto y los síntomas depresivos en nuevas, primerizas mamás usando un modelo de mezcla de crecimiento. Los resultados mostraron una clase de mujeres con ‘bajo riesgo’ (88.8%) que manifestaron bajos niveles de depresión y altos niveles de PSE durante el período posterior al parto; un segundo grupo de mujeres, llamado ‘de temprano riesgo’ (6.3%) con altos niveles de depresión que disminuyeron a lo largo del tiempo, pero más bajos niveles de PSE que se mantuvieron equitativamente estables; y un final grupo de trayectoria denominado la clase del ‘riesgo tardío’ (4.9%) con iniciales bajos niveles de depresión y altos niveles de PSE que significativamente aumentaron y disminuyeron, respectivamente, a lo largo del período. El trauma en la temprana niñez, el estés de crianza, así como las débiles prácticas de crianza fueron afiliaciones asociadas dentro de una clase de alto riesgo. Las mamás en los grupos de alto riesgo reportaron niños con conductas más agresivas y desafiantes a la edad de tres años. Concluimos con una discusión de las implicaciones de nuestros resultados para desarrollar intervenciones eficaces y sensibles.La dépression postpartum et l'auto-efficacité parentale (abrégé en français ici AEP) sont des facteurs de risque pour les problèmes de comportement de l'enfant. On sait peu de choses, cependant, à propos du cours des trajectoires duels des symptômes dépressifs concomitants et l'AEP ou son impact sur le développement socio-émotionnel des enfants. Cette étude a cherché à identifier les trajectoires d'AEP postpartum et de symptômes dépressifs chez des mères étant mères pour la première fois, en utilisant un modèle de croissance mixte. Les résultats ont fait état d'une classe de femmes avec un “risque moindre” (88,8%) qui faisaient preuve de niveaux peu élevés de dépression et de niveaux élevés d'AEP durant la période postpartum; un deuxième groupe de femmes, appelé “risque précoce” (6,3%) avec des niveaux élevés de dépression qui ont décru au fil du temps et avec des niveaux plus bas d'AEP qui restaient relativement stables; et un groupe de trajectoire finale estimé comme étant la classe de ‘risque tardif’ (4,9%) avec initialement des niveaux moindres de dépression et des niveaux élevés d'AEP qui ont respectivement augmenté et baissé de manière importante, au fil de cette période. Le trauma de la petite enfance, le stress de parentage et de mauvaises pratiques parentales étaient liés à l'appartenance à la classe à haut risque. Les mères des groupes à risque élevé ont fait état d'enfants avec un comportement plus agressif et défiant à l’âge de trois ans. Nous concluons en discutant les implications pour le développement d'interventions efficaces et sensibles.Duale Verläufe elterlicher Selbstwirksamkeit sowie depressiver Symptomatik bei postpartalen Müttern und deren Auswirkungen auf die sozio-emotionale Anpassung im frühen Kindesalter: Ein Growth Mixture Modell Postpartale Depression und elterliche Selbstwirksamkeit (parental self-efficacy; PSE) sind Risikofaktoren für nachteiliges kindliches Verhalten. Es ist jedoch wenig bekannt über den Verlauf gemeinsam auftretender depressiver Symptomatik und PSE oder deren Auswirkung auf die sozio-emotionale Entwicklung der Kinder. In dieser Studie wurde versucht, mit Hilfe von Growth Mixture Modellierung Verläufe von postpartaler PSE und depressiver Symptomatik bei Erstgebärenden zu identifizieren. Die Ergebnisse zeigten drei Gruppen auf. Die erste Gruppe bestand aus Frauen mit “niedrigem Risiko” (88,8%), die während der postpartalen Phase niedrige Depressions- und hohe PSE-Werte hatten. Die zweite Gruppe bestand aus Frauen mit “frühem Risiko” (6,3%), die anfänglich hohe aber im Laufe der Zeit abnehmende Depressionswerte und niedrigere, ziemlich stabil bleibenden PSE-Werte hatten. Die letzte Verlaufs-Gruppe bestand aus Frauen mit “spätem Risiko” (4,9%), die anfänglich niedrige Depressions- und hohe PSE-Werte hatten, die im Laufe der Zeit signifikant anstiegen bzw. abnahmen. Frühkindliches Trauma, elterlicher Stress und nachteilige Erziehungspraktiken waren mit der Zugehörigkeit zu einer Hochrisikoklasse assoziiert. Mütter in den Hochrisikogruppen berichteten von Kindern mit mehr aggressivem und trotzigem Verhalten im Alter von drei Jahren. Abschließend werden die Implikationen unserer Ergebnisse für die Entwicklung effektiver und sensibler Interventionen diskutiert.第一子産後の母親における育児自己効力感及び抑うつ症状と早期幼児期の社会情緒的適応の2つの軌跡:成長混合モデル 産後うつと育児自己効力感 (PSE) は子どもの問題行動を引き起こす危険因子である。しかし、併発する抑うつ症状と自己効力感あるいはその影響による子どもの社会情緒の発達がたどる2つの軌跡についてはほとんど知られていない。この研究は成長混合モデリングを用いて、第一子産後の母親に生じる育児自己効力感と抑うつ症状の軌跡を同定しようとするものである。結果は以下のようであった。‘低リスク’の女性グループ (88.8％) は、産後の抑うつレベルが低く、育児自己効力感が高かった。第二グループ (6.3％) の女性は‘早期リスク’とされ、抑うつレベルが高くても時間経過で治まるものだが、育児自己効力感は低くその後も変わらない。最後の軌跡のグループ (4.9％) は‘後期リスク’と見なされるが、はじめ抑うつレベルは低く育児自己効力感は高いのだが、時を経る中でそれぞれ大幅に上がり、そして下がる。早期幼児期のトラウマ、育児ストレス、そして未熟な育児実践が、高リスクに伴って見られた。高リスクグループの母親は3歳時の子どもが攻撃的で反抗的だったと報告した。私達は、この研究結果の意味を検討して効果的で慎重な介入を開発することとする。.产后抑郁症和父母自我效能感 (PSE) 是儿童不良行为的危险因素。然而, 关于抑郁症状和PSE同时发生的双轨迹过程及其对儿童社交情感发展的影响知之甚少。本研究试图通过生长混合模型来确定初产母亲产后PSE和抑郁症状的发展轨迹。结果显示, 第一组“低风险”女性 (88.8%) 在产后表现出低水平的抑郁和高水平的PSE;第二组女性, 被标记为“早期风险” (6.3%) , 其抑郁程度会随着时间的推移而降低, 但PSE水平较低并保持相当稳定;最后一个轨迹组认为是“晚期风险”类别 (4.9%) , 其最初具有低水平的抑郁和高水平的PSE, 但在这段时间内分别显著增加和减少。儿童早期创伤、育儿压力和不良的育儿习惯与高风险类别的组员身份有关。高危组的母亲报告说, 孩子在三岁时表现出更具攻击性和挑衅性的行为。最后, 我们讨论了研究结果对制定有效和敏感的干预措施的影响。.المسارات المزدوجة للفعالية الذاتية للتربية الوالدية وأعراض الاكتئاب عند الأمهات الجديدات بعد الولادة والتكيف الاجتماعي العاطفي في مرحلة الطفولة المبكرة: نموذج خليط النمو الاكتئاب بعد الولادة والفعالية الذاتية للوالدين(PSE) هي عوامل خطر لسوء سلوك الطفل. ومع ذلك، لا يعرف الكثير عن تطور المسار المزدوج لأعراض الاكتئاب المتزامنة والكفاءة الذاتية للتربية الوالدية أو تأثيرها على النمو الاجتماعي العاطفي للأطفال. سعت هذه الدراسة إلى تحديد مساراتPSE بعد الولادة وأعراض الاكتئاب عند الأمهات الجدد لأول مرة باستخدام نمذجة خليط النمو . وأظهرت النتائج وجود فئة من النساء ذوات “المخاطر المنخفضة” (88.8 في المائة) من النساء اللاتي أظهرن مستويات منخفضة من الاكتئاب ومستويات عالية من PSE خلال فترة ما بعد الولادة؛ ومجموعة ثانية من النساء، وصفت ب “الخطر المبكر” (6.3٪) مع مستويات عالية من الاكتئاب انخفضت مع مرور الوقت ومستويات منخفضة من PSE والتي ظلت مستقرة إلى حد ما. كما وجدت مجموعة أخيرة وصفت بمجموعة “المخاطر المتأخرة” (4.9٪) مع مستويات منخفضة في البداية من الاكتئاب وارتفاع مستويات PSE والتي زادت وانخفضت بشكل ملحوظ ، على التوالي، على مدى فترة الدراسة. وارتبطت صدمة الطفولة المبكرة، والإجهاد الأبوي، وسوء ممارسات التربية بالانتماء إلى أحد هذه المجموعات ذات المخاطرة العالية. وأبلغت الأمهات في فئات المخاطرة العالية عن أطفال يعانون من سلوك أكثر عدوانية وعناداً في سن الثالثة. وتختم الدراسة بمناقشة تطبيقات النتائج لتطوير تدخلات فعالة وحساسة.",0.834127452

Participants completed the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Self-Rating Scale (PTSD-SS), Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist, Social Support Rate Scale, and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Distinct patterns of PTSD symptom trajectories were established through grouping participants based on time-varying changes of developing PTSD (i.e. reaching the clinical cut-off on the PTSD-SS). Multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine predictors for trajectory membership.PTSD prevalence rates at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months were 21.0, 23.3, 13.5 and 14.7%, respectively. Five PTSD symptom trajectories were observed: resistance (65.3% of the sample), recovery (20.0%), relapsing/remitting (3.3%), delayed dysfunction (4.2%) and chronic dysfunction (7.2%). Female gender and senior grade were related to higher risk of developing PTSD symptoms in at least one time point, whereas being an only child increased the possibility of recovery relative to chronic dysfunction. Family members' injury/loss and witness of traumatic scenes could also cause PTSD chronicity. More negative life events, less social support, more negative coping and less positive coping were also common predictors for not developing resistance or recovery.Adolescents' PTSD symptoms showed an anniversary reaction. Although many adolescents remain euthymic or recover over time, some adolescents, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibit chronic, delayed or relapsing symptoms. Thus, the need for individualized intervention with these adolescents is indicated.",0.832947318

The current study examined latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms using data from 3,819 respondents of the Adolescent Health Survey. Four trajectory profiles of depressive symptoms were identified: low-stable, high-decreasing, low-increasing, and moderate-decreasing. A broad array of risk factors were included into the modeling procedure to identify predictors of group membership. Relative to the low-stable group, membership in one of the three symptomatic groups (i.e., heightened depressive symptoms) was predicted by poverty, low self-esteem, gender, drinking frequency, poor academic outcomes, delinquency, and child maltreatment type. This study contributes to our understanding about the longitudinal manifestations of depression and identifies a broad array of factors significantly related to pathways of resilience.",0.831299273

Data were from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging Survey for the years 1996-2007 ( N = 3,186). LA trajectories were identified by using latent class growth curve modeling. Regression analyses were applied to predict the relationships among baseline characteristics, LA trajectories, and disability. Four LA trajectories—consistent high, consistent low, increasing, and decreasing—were identified. Lower depressive symptom was related to consistently active in LAs. Younger age and fewer comorbidities were related to develop an increasing LA trajectory. Participants in the consistent-high or increasing LA trajectories were more likely to be functionally independent, but those in the decreasing LA subgroup were more at risk of developing disability. The findings suggested that long-term changes in LA over time have benefits on physical health in older population.",0.831163934

Trajectories within communities exposed to shared, prolonged violence involving subgroups differing in perspectives, and roles during the event have not been studied. This study examined trajectories of posttraumatic stress (PTS) and depressive symptoms secondary to exposure to violence during civil unrest in citizens (n = 311) and law enforcement (n = 255) over 1.5 years following exposure. Latent class growth modeling was used to examine trajectories of PTS and depressive symptoms. Four-class quadratic solutions for both PTS and depressive symptoms demonstrated best fit. Similar patterns emerged for such that most participants were classified as resistant (57% and 67%, respectively), followed by resilience (23.8% and 17.2%), chronic (12.6% and 12.0%), and worsening (6.1% and 4.4%). When all predictors were entered in a single model, race, and membership in citizen or law enforcement groups did not distinguish trajectories of recovery. Higher income and social support emerged as consistent protective factors against PTS and depressive symptoms, while trauma history emerged as a risk factor for PTS.

Latent class trajectory analyses were used to identify disaster-related PTSS trajectory groups across the 4-year postdisaster period.Three groups were identified: (1) a group that declined (recovery) in PTSS over time (15.90%); (2) a group that was stable and low in PTSS over time (76.87%); and (3) a group that was stable and high (chronic) in PTSS over time (7.23%). Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that greater tornado exposure predicted membership in the declining trajectory group relative to the low-stable group. Positive parenting and pretornado caregiver trauma exposure also moderated how disaster exposure, particularly perceived life threat, predicted PTSS trajectories.Some youth reported elevated disaster-related PTSS repeatedly for 4 years following a devastating tornado. Consistent with the concept of equifinality, results suggest that there are several pre-exposure risk factors that may increase risk for a chronic PTSS trajectory following disaster exposure.

The current paper employs growth mixture modeling to identify differential trajectories of change in the course of post-combat aggression. A Brigade Combat Team completed surveys within 72 h of return from an Iraq deployment, 4 months later, and at 12 months after return. Based on model fit indices, analyses yielded four latent aggression trajectories: “low-stable”, “delayed”, “recovery”, and “chronic”. In addition, most individuals aligned with a “low-stable” trajectory indicative of minimal aggression in the first year following return from a combat deployment. A conditional model showed that lower posttraumatic stress and lower combat exposure characterized individuals aligned with the “low-stable” aggression trajectory relative to individuals aligned with “chronic” and “delayed” aggression trajectories.

In case of severe distress, an adjustment disorder (AD) might develop. This study investigates the course of AD symptoms during 1 year and its predictors in BCS up to 5 years post-treatment. Methods BCS completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. HADS total scores were defined as no mental disorder (MD) symptoms (≤ 10), AD symptoms (11–14), and any other MD symptoms (≥ 15). Over the course of four assessments, symptom trajectories were a priori defined as no MD symptoms, AD symptoms, fluctuating AD symptoms below and above cut-offs, or any other MD symptoms. Complementary, latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to identify data-driven trajectories. Results Among 293 BCS with complete data, the majority was classified as no MD symptoms (54.4%), followed by 37.5% in the fluctuating AD symptoms trajectory. Only 1.4% had AD symptoms, and 6.8% had any other MD symptoms. With LCGA ( N = 459), three trajectories were found: stable no MD symptoms (58.6%), stable AD symptoms (32.9%), and high increasing any other MD symptoms (8.5%). Compared to BCS with no MD symptoms, BCS with fluctuating AD symptoms or any other MD symptoms were younger, less able to handle daily activities, and showed more social support discrepancy, neuroticism, and less optimism. Conclusions Results of our study showed that AD symptoms in BCS up to 5 years post-treatment fluctuate over 1 year. It is thus important to appropriately assess AD over the course of 5 years post-treatment as AD symptoms can fluctuate.",0.829728579

In order to identify how the level of civic consciousness of Korean adolescence follows the trajectory, this study uses a latent growth model and the sturcutural equation of Mplus 8 to explore each individual’s trajectory. The growth mixing model can group students according to the different trajectory, and it suggests the influencing factors by classified latent groups. &#x0D; Results As results, first, the individual change trajectory of middle school students' civic consciousness changes by time point, and the difference in the change between individuals was found to be significant. Second, middle school students' civic consciousness change trajectories could be classified into high-level gradual growth, middle-level maintenance, and low-level maintenance. It appeared the high-level gradual growth class showed significant growth each year, while the other two classes showed insignificant rate of change over time. Third, the higher the career maturity, morality, and more active attitude, the higher the possibility of being included in the high-level gradual growth class.&#x0D; Conclusions This shows that it is possible to help build a sense of civic consciousness through institutional support that can create an environment that respects young people's learning attitude, career search for the future, compliance with rules, and conscience, and that can improve such environment.",0.828867584

In this study, we derived trajectories of depressive symptoms in adolescents and examined the codevelopment of multiple behavioral and academic problems in these trajectories.Participants were 6,910 students from secondary schools primarily located in disadvantaged areas of Quebec (Canada) who were assessed annually from the age 12 to 16 years. Trajectories were identified using growth mixture modeling. The course of behavioral (delinquency, substance use) and academic adjustment (school liking, academic achievement) in trajectories was examined by deriving latent growth curves for each covariate conditional on trajectory membership.We identified five trajectories of stable-low (68.1%), increasing (12.1%), decreasing (8.7%), transient (8.7%), and stable-high (2.4%) depressive symptoms. Examination of conditional latent growth curves revealed that the course of behavioral and academic problems closely mirrored the course of depressive symptoms in each trajectory.This pattern of results suggests that the course of depressive symptoms and other adjustment problems over time is likely to involve an important contribution of shared underlying developmental process(es).",0.827778628

Although psychiatric symptoms may improve or worsen over time, relatively little is known about the course of PPD symptoms and possible fluctuations.We applied a person-centered approach to examine PPD symptom patterns across pregnancy and childbirth. 824 women were assessed at three time points: first trimester (T1), third trimester (T2), and again at eight weeks (T3) postpartum. We assessed PPD symptoms, maternal mental health history, and childbirth variables.Growth mixture modeling (GMM) analysis revealed four discrete PPD symptom trajectory classes including chronic PPD (1.1%), delayed (10.2%), recovered (7.2%), and resilient (81.5%). Delivery complications were associated with chronic PPD but also with the recovered PPD trajectory class. History of mental health disorders was associated with chronic PPD and the delayed PPD class.The findings underscore that significant changes in a woman's depression level can occur across pregnancy and childbirth. While a minority of women experience chronic PDD, for others depression symptoms appear to significantly alleviate over time, suggesting a form of recovery. Our findings support a personalized medicine approach based on the woman's symptom trajectory.

As various potential threats to LS tend to increase with advancing years, patterns of age-related changes in LS among older adults remain inconsistent. This study aimed to identify LS trajectories in older adults and the characteristics of individuals who experience them. Large-scale, nationally representative, longitudinal data collected from 2005 to 2013 were analyzed for this study. The outcome measure was a summary of multidimensional domains influencing LS: health, finance, housing, neighbor relationships, and family relationships. Latent class growth models and logistic regression models were used to identify trajectory groups and their predictors, respectively. Within 3517 individuals aged 65 or older, five trajectories were identified across eight follow-up years: “low-stable” (TG1; n = 282; 8%), “middle-stable” (TG2; n = 1146; 32.6%), “improving” (TG3; n = 75; 2.1%), “upper middle-stable” (TG4; n = 1653; 47%), and “high” (TG5; n = 361; 10.3%). High trajectory individuals more frequently had higher education, financial security, good physical health, and good mental health than those in the stable, but less satisfied, groups. Similarly, compared to the largest group (upper middle-stable trajectory), individuals in the low-stable or middle-stable trajectory group not only had poorer physical and mental health but were more likely to be living alone, financially stressed, and residing in urban locations. Individuals with improving trajectory were younger and in poorer mental health at baseline compared to the upper middle-stable trajectory group. Life satisfaction in the older follows distinct trajectories. For older adults, trajectories are stable over time and predictable, in part, from individual characteristics. Knowledge of these patterns is important for effective policy and program development.",0.827556282

Six trajectories described PTSD over time: low‐stable (48.9%), moderate‐stable (28.3%), moderate‐increasing (8.2%), high‐stable (6.0%), high‐decreasing (6.6 %), and very high‐stable (2.0%). To examine factors associated with improving or worsening PTSD symptoms, groups with similar intercepts, but different trajectories were compared using bivariate analyses and logistic regression. The adjusted odds of being in the moderate‐increasing relative to the moderate‐stable group were significantly greater among enrollees reporting low social integration ( OR = 2.18), WTC exposures (range = 1.34 to 1.53), job loss related to the September 11, 2001 disaster ( OR = 1.41), or unmet mental health need/treatment ( OR = 4.37).

The aim of this study was to assess the mechanisms underlying distinct trajectories of parental PTSD that affect children's PTSD and depression through the feeling of safety.The final sample comprised 242 dyads of parents and their children who experienced Super Typhoon Lekima in 2019. All participants were surveyed at three time points after the typhoon: 3 months (T1), 15 months (T2), and 27 months (T3). Parental PTSD symptoms at three time points and children's PTSD, depression, and feeling of safety at T3 were analyzed.Four parental PTSD trajectories were identified: recovery, resilience, delayed, and coping. Compared with the resilient group, children of parents with delayed PTSD trajectories reported higher levels of depression at T3, while children of parents in the coping group were more likely to experience severe PTSD at T3. Children of parents in the recovery group, with a reduced feeling of safety, exhibited more severe depression and PTSD at T3, whereas children of parents in the delayed group were at an increased risk of PTSD at T3.These findings highlight the heterogeneity of parental PTSD trajectories following natural disasters and their distinct effects on children's PTSD and depression.

Latent class growth analysis was used to investigate perceived QOL trajectories (separately for youth and parent perspectives) over a 3-year period (four data collection time points spaced 12 months apart). Multinomial logistic regression was employed to identify factors associated with these trajectories.A total of 439 youth and one of their parents participated at baseline, and 302 (69 %) of those youth/parent dyads completed all four data collection time points. Two QOL trajectories were identified for the youth analysis: 'high and stable' (85.7 %) and 'moderate/low and stable' (14.3 %), while three trajectories were found for the parent analysis: 'high and stable' (35.7 %), 'moderate and stable' (46.6 %), and 'moderate/low and stable' (17.7 %). Relative to the 'high and stable' groups, youth with more reported pain/other physical symptoms, emotional symptoms, and home/community barriers were more likely to be in the 'moderate and stable' or 'moderate/low and stable' groups. Also, youth with higher reported self-determination, spirituality, family social support, family functioning, school productivity/engagement, and school belongingness/safety were less likely to be in the 'moderate and stable' or 'moderate/low and stable' groups, compared to the 'high and stable' groups.Findings suggest that youth with chronic conditions experience stable global perceived QOL across time, but that some individuals maintain stability at moderate to moderate/low levels which is related to ongoing personal and environmental influences. Potential benefits of universal strategies and programs to safeguard resilience for all youth and targeted interventions to optimize certain youths' global perceived QOL are indicated.",0.826570807

Our study aims to explore trajectories of traumatic stress reactions following childhood IPV exposure, and their relation with parental traumatic stress and child emotional security in the interparental subsystem. The sample comprised 303 children (age 3–10, M = 6.20) from families referred to institutions for IPV. Data were collected at home. Three waves of parent-reported questionnaire data were analyzed using latent class growth analysis and linear regression. Five trajectories were identified: ‘resilient’, ‘moderate stable’, ‘struggling’, ‘improving’, and ‘elevated adjusting’. Only the ‘struggling’ trajectory had dysfunctional symptom levels at the final wave. Higher parental traumatic stress predicted ‘improving’ trajectory membership (β = 0.17, p = .033), whereas lower parental traumatic stress (β = −0.20, p = .003) and child emotional insecurity (β = −0.45, p = < .001) predicted ‘resilient’ trajectory membership. Higher child emotional insecurity predicted membership in trajectories with higher initial traumatic stress (improving: β = 0.26, p < .001; struggling: β = 0.31, p < .001; elevated adjusting: β = 0.27, p < .001). Child emotional security did not buffer the effect of parental traumatic stress on likelihood of dysfunctional trajectory membership (β = 0.04, p =.380). Children exposed to IPV show different trajectories of traumatic stress reactions, partly corresponding to trajectories identified in other populations. Child emotional security and parental traumatic stress predict trajectory membership.",0.826335545

This study aimed to identify subgroups of depression symptom trajectories in a sample of adolescents, and to describe psychosocial attributes of the different groups. In a longitudinal study, 243 adolescents (121 males and 122 females), were assessed using a battery of measures of temperament, psychopathology, and psychological and behavioral functioning. Four phases of data collection over 7 years spanned average ages of the participants from 12 to 18 years old. Depressive symptoms from each phase were used to model latent class growth trajectories. A 4-group solution was selected as the best-fitting model: (1) ongoing stable low levels of depression; (2) very high depressive symptoms initially, but a steep decrease in symptoms over time; (3) moderately high depressive symptoms initially, but symptoms decreased over time; and (4) initially low levels of symptoms that increased over time. Trajectory group membership was associated with a range of psychosocial variables including temperament, childhood maltreatment, and young adult quality of life. Characterising these subgroups allows for a better understanding of how the interaction of risk factors increases the likelihood of depression and other poor outcomes, and highlights the importance of early interventions to prevent and treat adolescent depression.",0.824977621

The aim of this study was to determine whether latent class analysis, latent class growth analysis or growth mixture modeling was most appropriate for identifying developmental trajectory classes.We compared the three methods in a simulation study in several scenarios, which varied regarding e.g. sample size and degree of separation between classes. The simulation study was replicated with a real data example concerning anxiety/depression symptoms measured over 6 time points in the Tracking Adolescent Individuals' Lives Survey (TRAILS, N = 2227).Growth mixture modeling was least biased or equally biased compared to latent class analysis and latent class growth analysis in all scenarios. In TRAILS, the shapes of the trajectories were rather similar over the three methods, but class sizes differed slightly. A 4-class growth mixture model performed best, based on several fit indices, interpretability and clinical relevance.Growth mixture modeling seems most suitable to identify developmental trajectory classes.",0.824974526

The aim of this study was to identify heterogeneous trajectory subgroups for family conflict and somatic symptoms and their joint trajectories. A representative sample of 424 community participants completed surveys at baseline and 1-, 4-, and 10-year follow-ups. Family conflict and somatic symptoms were assessed at each wave. Covariates (age, gender, marital status, education, and medical conditions) were assessed at baseline. Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to identify heterogeneous trajectory subgroups for family conflict and somatic symptoms. A parallel process GMM was used to examine joint trajectory subgroup membership between family conflict and somatic symptoms. There were three trajectory subgroups for family conflict: stable low; worsening; and improving, and three somewhat similar trajectory subgroups for somatic symptoms: stable low; stable moderate; and improving. Family conflict and somatic symptom trajectory subgroup memberships were jointly associated. Individuals who had stable low family conflict were most likely to follow a stable low somatic symptom trajectory. Individuals who improved in family conflict were most likely to continue to have stable low somatic symptoms or improve in somatic symptoms. Moreover, individuals who had stable moderate somatic symptoms were most likely to show worsening family conflict. This study demonstrates heterogeneous family conflict and somatic symptom trajectories and indicates that these trajectories covary over time.",0.824034609

This 5-wave longitudinal study used growth mixture modeling to explore heterogeneous trajectories of psychological well-being (self-esteem) and distress (depression, anxiety, stress) spanning just before college to the end of the fourth year. Students (N = 5,537) most commonly were best characterized by trajectories of stable positive or moderate adjustment, though some were better characterized by trajectories of low or variable adjustment. These latter subgroups may represent the highest-need students, for whom identifying pre-college risk and protective factors is crucial. Some notable differences emerged in trajectories for women versus men. Further, several individual characteristics at the cusp of college predicted these four-year trajectories. The strongest psychological functioning predictors were self-esteem, distress, and stress (less consistently, resilience and self-efficacy). The most predictive cognitive-affective strategy was avoidant emotional coping, followed by cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression (less consistently, problem-focused and active emotional coping). Social well-being factors that best differentiated adjustment trajectories were general social support, followed by support from family and then from friends. These findings have implications for targeting at-risk students upon university arrival to promote optimal long-term adjustment.",0.823833865

Design: Prospective longitudinal design. Setting: Two tertiary care PICUs in Brisbane, Qld, Australia. Patients: Children 2–16 years old admitted to PICU for longer than 8 hours. Measurements Main Results: Maternal reported child posttraumatic stress symptoms ( n = 272) on the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children were used to assess posttraumatic stress symptoms up to 12 months post admission. Semiparametric group-based trajectory analyses were completed to identify patterns over time. Age, gender, length of stay, premorbid functioning, maternal perceived threat to life, and maternal acute distress were assessed as potential risk factors. Three likely trajectory groups were identified. The majority of children were resilient (83.8%); however, a significant minority experienced chronic symptoms (12.9%) or elevated stress symptoms which resolved quickly (3.3%). After controlling for other variables, maternal report of premorbid internalizing behavior significantly predicted both chronic (odds ratio, 6.3) and recovery (odds ratio, 38.0) trajectories. Maternal acute distress significantly predicted child chronic symptom trajectories (odds ratio, 5.2). Conclusions: Children with elevated trauma symptoms postintensive care need timely and effective intervention. The majority of children with high levels of acute symptoms will continue to have chronic, ongoing posttraumatic stress symptoms. In addition, acute maternal distress and preexisting internalizing child behavior predict ongoing psychologic distress after discharge from the PICU. Screening in the acute period post-PICU admission may identify children likely to experience ongoing chronic posttraumatic distress symptoms and enable targeted treatment of children at risk. This is the first study to examine symptom trajectories in children following pediatric intensive care admission and includes a sample of very young children.",0.823642273

Participants completed questionnaires regarding posttraumatic growth or depreciation in personal strength and relationship domains 1 month after the first earthquake in September 2010 (N = 185) and 3 months (n = 156) and 12 months (n = 144) after the more severe February 2011 earthquake. Three classes of growth or depreciation patterns were found for both domains. For personal strength, most of the participants were grouped into a ""no growth or depreciation"" class and smaller proportions were grouped into either a ""posttraumatic depreciation"" or ""posttraumatic growth"" class. The 3 classes for relationships all reported posttraumatic growth, differing only in degree. None of the slopes were significant for any of the classes, indicating that levels of growth or depreciation reported after the first earthquake remained stable when assessed at 2 time points after the second earthquake. Multinomial logistic regression analyses examining pre- and postearthquake predictors of trajectory class membership revealed that those in the ""posttraumatic growth"" personal strength class were significantly younger and had significantly higher pre-earthquake mental health than those in the ""posttraumatic depreciation"" class. Sex was the only predictor of the relationship classes: No men were assigned to the ""high posttraumatic growth"" class. Implications and future directions are discussed.",0.823101684

History of depression and antenatal depression have been identified as important PPD’s risk factors, underlining the continuity of depressive symptoms during the transition to parenthood. However, only few studies have focused on the evolution of depressive symptoms with longitudinal research design. The present study aims at analyzing the longitudinal trajectories of depressive symptoms from the third trimester of pregnancy to 1 year after childbirth. One hundred and twenty-six first-time fathers completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at four time points (7-8 months of pregnancy, 40 days, 5-6 months, and 12 months after childbirth). Data were analyzed throughout latent growth mixture modeling. Latent growth mixture modeling analysis indicated a three-class model as the optimal solution. The three-class solution included a trajectory of low, stable depressive symptoms across the four time points ( resilient, 52%); a trajectory of moderate, relatively stable depressive symptomatology ( distress, 37%); and a trajectory of emergent clinical depression following a pattern of high depressive symptoms ( emergent depression, 11%). This study allowed to identify different subpopulation within the sample, distinguishing among mental well-being, emotional distress, and high-risk conditions when—1 year after childbirth—fathers report the highest scores to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. These results underline the importance to analyze fathers’ well-being over the time during the transition to fatherhood.",0.822855868

Due to climate change, an increase of such events is predicted for the future. While natural disasters have been a rare phenomenon in Europe so far, other regions of the world, such as Central and North America or Southeast Asia, have regularly been affected by Hurricanes and Tsunamis. The aim of the current study is to synthesize the literature on child development in immediate stress, prolonged reactions, trauma, and recovery after natural disasters with a special focus on trajectories of (mal-)adaptation. In a literature search using PubMed, Psychinfo and EBSCOhost, 15 studies reporting about 11 independent samples, including 11,519 participants aged 3-18 years, were identified. All studies identified resilience, recovery, and chronic trajectories. There was also evidence for delayed or relapsing trajectories. The proportions of participants within each trajectory varied across studies, but the more favorable trajectories such as resilient or recovering trajectory were the most prevalent. The results suggested a more dynamic development within the first 12 months post-disaster. Female gender, a higher trauma exposure, more life events, less social support, and negative coping emerged as risk factors. Based on the results, a stepped care approach seems useful for the treatment of victims of natural disasters. This may support victims in their recovery and strengthen their resilience. As mental health responses to disasters vary, a coordinated screening process is necessary, to plan interventions and to detect delayed or chronic trauma responses and initiate effective interventions.",0.821518229
https://openalex.org/W2905950606,10.1037/rep0000254,Socioeconomic resources predict trajectories of depression and resilience following disability.,"Adjustment to chronic disability is a topic of considerable focus in the rehabilitation sciences and constitutes an important public health problem given the adverse outcomes associated with maladjustment. While existing literature has established an association between disability onset and elevated rates of depression, resilience and alternative patterns of adjustment have received substantially less empirical inquiry. The current study sought to model heterogeneity in mental health responding to disability onset in later life while exploring the impact of socioeconomic resources on these latent patterns of adaptation.Latent growth mixture modeling was utilized to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms surrounding physical disability onset in a population sample of older adults. Individuals with verified disability onset (n = 3,204) were followed across four measurement points representing a 6-year period.Four trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified: resilience (56.5%), emerging depression (17.2%), remitting depression (13.4%), and chronic depression (12.9%). Socioeconomic resources were then analyzed as predictors of trajectory membership. Prior education and financial assets at the time of disability onset robustly predicted class membership in the resilient class compared to all other classes.The course of adjustment in response to disability onset is heterogeneous. Our results confirm the presence of multiple pathways of adjustment surrounding late-life disability, with the most common outcome being near-zero depressive symptoms for the duration of the study. Socioeconomic resources strongly predicted membership in the resilient class compared with all other classes, indicating that such resources may play a protective role during the stress of physical disability onset.

This study is the first to explore mental health trajectories and associated predictors in military members across the first 3-4 years of their career to provide evidence to inform early interventions.This prospective cohort study surveyed Australian Defence personnel (n = 5329) at four time-points across their early military career. Core outcomes were psychological distress (K10+) and posttraumatic stress symptoms [four-item PTSD Checklist (PCL-4)] with intra-individual, organizational and event-related trajectory predictors. Latent class growth analyses (LCGAs) identified subgroups within the sample that followed similar longitudinal trajectories for these outcomes, while conditional LCGAs examined the variables that influenced patterns of mental health.Three clear trajectories emerged for psychological distress: resilient (84.0%), worsening (9.6%) and recovery (6.5%). Four trajectories emerged for post-traumatic stress, including resilient (82.5%), recovery (9.6%), worsening (5.8%) and chronic subthreshold (2.3%) trajectories. Across both outcomes, prior trauma exposure alongside modifiable factors, such as maladaptive coping styles, and increased anger and sleep difficulties were associated with the worsening and chronic subthreshold trajectories, whilst members in the resilient trajectories were more likely to be male, report increased social support from family/friends and Australian Defence Force (ADF) sources, and use adaptive coping styles.The emergence of symptoms of mental health problems occurs early in the military lifecycle for a significant proportion of individuals. Modifiable factors associated with wellbeing identified in this study are ideal targets for intervention, and should be embedded and consolidated throughout the military career.",0.820124945

Data were used from a cluster-randomised controlled trial evaluating a problem-solving intervention for CMD patients (N = 158) who had returned to work. Information on anxiety and depressive symptoms, work functioning and RTW% was collected at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. Latent class growth analyses were used to identify trajectories for the four outcomes and investigate how these trajectories clustered in higher order latent classes. Additionally, we investigated the relation between patient characteristics and class membership. We identified four trajectories for all four outcomes and derived three higher order latent classes: slow recovery (42% [66/158]) (high anxiety and depressive symptoms, moderate to low work functioning and fast RTW); fast recovery (25% [40/158]) (low anxiety and depressive symptoms, high work functioning and fast RTW); and gradual recovery (33% [52/158] (decreasing anxiety and depressive symptoms, increasing or low work functioning and fast RTW). Participants with a higher work engagement and readiness to stay at work were more likely to belong to the fast recovery class. Due to the relatively small sample size, some trajectories consisted of few participants. Symptom severity was self-reported. Many CMD patients experience high levels of mental health symptoms and work functioning problems during the year post RTW.

Despite several longitudinal studies, little is known about the timing of an increase in post-traumatic stress symptoms relative to pre-deployment. Longitudinal studies starting pre-deployment, in which participants are repeatedly measured over time, are warranted to assess the timing of an increase in symptoms to ultimately assess the timing of an increase in treatment demand after deployment. Methods In this large observational cohort study, Dutch military personnel who were deployed to Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Forces between March, 2005, and September, 2008, were assessed for post-traumatic stress symptoms with the Self-Rating Inventory for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (SRIP) questionnaire. Participants were assessed 1 month before deployment and followed up at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, and 5 years after deployment, with changes in SRIP scores compared with pre-deployment using a mixed model analysis. The primary outcome was the total score of post-traumatic stress symptoms measured with SRIP at pre-deployment and the five follow-up assessments, with a score of 38 used as the cutoff to indicate substantial post-traumatic stress symptoms. Findings Between March, 2005, and September, 2008, 1007 participants were recruited to this study. The results show two important effects of deployment on post-traumatic stress symptoms. A short-term symptom increase within the first 6 months after deployment (symptom increase coefficient for SRIP score vs pre-deployment [β] 0·99, 95% CI 0·50–1·48); and a long-term symptom increase at 5 years after deployment (β 1·67, 1·14–2·20). Interpretation This study underlines the importance of long-term monitoring of the psychological health of soldiers after deployment because early detection of symptoms is essential to early treatment, which is related to improved psychological health.

Heterogeneity could be due to differences in trauma types and patient demographic characteristics.This analysis pooled data from six longitudinal studies of adult survivors of civilian-related injuries admitted to general hospital emergency departments (EDs) in six countries (pooled N = 3083). Each study included at least three assessments of the clinician-administered PTSD scale in the first post-trauma year. Latent class growth analysis determined the proportion of participants exhibiting various PTSD symptom trajectories within and across the datasets. Multinomial logistic regression analyses examined demographic characteristics, type of event leading to the injury, and trauma history as predictors of trajectories differentiated by their initial severity and course.Five trajectories were found across the datasets: Low (64.5%), Remitting (16.9%), Moderate (6.7%), High (6.5%), and Delayed (5.5%). Female gender, non-white race, prior interpersonal trauma, and assaultive injuries were associated with increased risk for initial PTSD reactions. Female gender and assaultive injuries were associated with risk for membership in the Delayed (v. Low) trajectory, and lower education, prior interpersonal trauma, and assaultive injuries with risk for membership in the High (v. Remitting) trajectory.The results suggest that over 30% of civilian-related injury survivors admitted to EDs experience moderate-to-high levels of PTSD symptoms within the first post-trauma year, with those reporting assaultive violence at increased risk of both immediate and longer-term symptoms.",0.818571728

Research to date, however, has largely considered future orientation as a static attribute. Developmental systems perspectives suggest that future orientation, when considered across time, will exhibit dynamic trajectories with levels changing in response to the varying balance of risks and resources in youths' environments. Investigating the developmental course and consequences of future orientation is particularly germane to maltreated youth who may benefit from programs that target this protective mechanism. The present study tested hypotheses regarding the developmental course of future orientation, including the association of distinct future orientation trajectories with time-varying risk factors and resources, and the association of continuity and change in future orientation trajectories with young adult psychosocial functioning. Hypotheses were investigated with longitudinal (T1 Mage = 12.22, T2 Mage = 13.52, T3 Mage = 14.79, T4 Mage = 18.54), multireporter data from a nationally representative sample of maltreated youth (N = 1,461). Growth mixture modeling (GMM) identified three classes of growth trajectories in future orientation: high-persistent, low start/increasing, and high start/decreasing. Time-variant and -invariant risk factors and resources differentiated youths' future orientation trajectories. Youth in the high-persistent and low start/increasing trajectories were more likely to attain young adulthood developmental milestones-including independent living skills, social capital, employment, and higher weekly income. This study documents how an important component of resilient adaptation emerges and promotes positive outcomes among highly vulnerable youth. (PsycINFO Database Record",0.818349476

This study aimed to identify trajectories of birth-related PTSD; determine factors associated with each trajectory; and identify women more likely to develop birth-related PTSD. 226 women who had traumatic childbirth according to DSM-IV criterion A were drawn from a community sample of 950 women. Measures were taken of PTSD, affective symptoms, fear of childbirth and social support in pregnancy, 4–6 weeks and 6-months postpartum. Information on some obstetric and psychosocial factors were also prospectively obtained. Four trajectories were identified: resilience (61.9%), recovery (18.5%), chronic-PTSD (13.7%) and delayed-PTSD (5.8%). Resilience was consistently distinguished from other PTSD trajectories by less affective symptoms at 4–6 weeks postpartum. Poor satisfaction with health professionals was associated with chronic-PTSD and delayed-PTSD. When affective symptoms at 4–6 weeks postpartum were removed from the model, less social support and higher fear of childbirth 4–6 weeks after birth predicted chronic and recovery trajectories; whereas experience of further trauma and low levels of satisfaction with health professionals were predictive of chronic-PTSD and delayed-PTSD, compared to resilience. Additional variables associated with different trajectories included antenatal affective symptoms, caesarean-section, preterm birth and receiving professional help. Use of self-report measures, use of DSM-IV criteria for PTSD diagnosis, and no follow-up beyond six months are the main limitations of this study. Identified factors may inform preventive and treatment interventions for women with traumatic birth experiences.",0.815964235

Method: This study used LGMM/LCGA to model trajectories of change in a sample of 2538 psychotherapy clients at a university student counseling center. This was a secondary analysis of naturalistically-collected outcome data using The Behavioral Health Measure. Results: LGMM models did not converge. A 2-class LCGA model was selected based on fit statistics and parsimony. One class was labeled as Slow and Steady Change Before Plateau, whereas the other was labeled as Early Rapid Change Before Plateau. We also extended these findings by considering variables associated with class membership. Conclusions: These classes followed similar trajectories to two of the classes identified by Owen et al. These results indicate that latent trajectory modeling may lead to replicable findings.

This review examined convergence/divergences across 54 studies in the nature and prevalence of response trajectories, and determined potential sources of bias to improve future research. Of the 67 cases that emerged from the 54 studies, the most consistently observed trajectories following PTEs were resilience (observed in: n = 63 cases), recovery (n = 49), chronic (n = 47), and delayed onset (n = 22). The resilience trajectory was the modal response across studies (average of 65.7% across populations, 95% CI [0.616, 0.698]), followed in prevalence by recovery (20.8% [0.162, 0.258]), chronicity (10.6%, [0.086, 0.127]), and delayed onset (8.9% [0.053, 0.133]). Sources of heterogeneity in estimates primarily resulted from substantive population differences rather than bias, which was observed when prospective data is lacking. Overall, prototypical trajectories have been identified across independent studies in relatively consistent proportions, with resilience being the modal response to adversity. Thus, trajectory models robustly identify clinically relevant patterns of response to potential trauma, and are important for studying determinants, consequences, and modifiers of course following potential trauma.",0.814310315

Group-based modeling identified PTG trajectories. Chi-square tests and ANOVA detected group differences in demographic, medical, and psychosocial variables.Six trajectory groups emerged. Three were stable at different levels of PTG, two increased modestly, and one increased substantially over time. Trajectory groups differed by age, race, receipt of chemotherapy, illness intrusiveness, depressive symptoms, active-adaptive coping, and social support.This first examination of PTG trajectories in US cancer survivors elucidates heterogeneity in longitudinal patterns of PTG. Future research should determine whether other samples exhibit similar trajectories and whether various PTG trajectories predict mental and physical health outcomes.",0.814011546

Recent studies have suggested more heterogeneous mental health outcomes than the initially identified four adjustment trajectories. To explore this heterogeneity, we investigated the after-trauma adjustment patterns of psychopathology based on retrospective lifetime data. This was first carried out on the PTSD symptoms (PTSS, including no symptoms, few symptoms, partial and full PTSD), and secondly together with their post-trauma comorbidities. Data of trauma and the post-trauma mental disorders were collected for a large and randomly selected community sample, resulting in a N = 960 trauma-exposed subsample. Pattern recognition as carried out by latent class analysis (LCA) was implemented on this subsample. LCA was first exploited to identify the potential trajectory patterns of PTSS and next to explore the patterns of mental adjustments when additional post-trauma comorbid disorders, such as anxiety, mood and substance use disorders, were assessed. Four PTSS trajectory patterns were found, namely resilient, chronic, recovered, and delayed onset, consistent with findings from longitudinal PTSD studies. When post-trauma comorbidities were evaluated, other than the trajectory pattern of delayed onset which retained a low comorbidity profile, the other three split respectively and paired up with either low, moderate or high comorbidity profile. Mental health outcomes after trauma exposure were considerably more complex than the four previously established adjustment trajectories. Here, we uncovered additional and more heterogeneous adjustment patterns comprised of PTSS trajectories and post-trauma comorbidity profiles.",0.813795289

As the need for mental health support is becoming increasingly prevalent in students, identification of factors associated with poorer outcomes is a priority. Changes in social functioning have a bi-directional relationship with mental health, however it is not clear how such measures may be related to effectiveness of psychological treatments. Methods Growth mixture models were estimated on a sample of 5221 students treated in routine mental health services to identify different trajectories of change in self-rated impairment in social leisure activities and close relationships during the course of treatment. Multinomial regression explored associations between trajectory classes and treatment outcomes. Results Five trajectory classes were identified for social leisure activity impairment while three classes were identified for close relationship impairment. In both measures most students remained mildly impaired. Other trajectories included severe impairment with limited improvement, severe impairment with delayed improvement, and, in social leisure activities only, rapid improvement, and deterioration. Trajectories of improvement were associated with positive treatment outcomes while trajectories of worsening or stable severe impairment were associated with negative treatment outcomes. Conclusions Changes in social functioning impairment are associated with psychological treatment outcomes in students, suggesting that these changes may be associated with treatment effectiveness as well as recovery experiences. Future research should seek to establish whether a causal link exists to understand whether integrating social support within psychological treatment may bring additional benefit for students.",0.813518136

Methods Data were obtained from four wave’s survey of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). A total of 3646 participants who aged 60 years or older during baseline survey, and completed all follow-ups were retained in this study. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10). Growth mixture modelling (GMM) was adopted to identify the trajectory classes of depressive symptoms, and both linear and quadratic functions were considered. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of the associated factors to predict the trajectory class of participants. Results A four-class quadratic function model was the best-fitting model for the trajectories of depressive symptoms in the older Chinese population. The four trajectories were labelled as increasing (16.70%), decreasing (12.31%), high and stable (7.30%), and low and stable (63.69%), according to their trends. Except for the low and stable trajectory, the other trajectories were almost above the threshold for depressive symptoms. The multivariate logistic regression model suggested that the trajectories of chronic depressive symptoms could be predicted by being female, living in a village (rural area), having a lower educational level, and having chronic diseases. Conclusions This study identified four depressive symptom trajectories in the older Chinese population and analysed the factors associated with the trajectory class. These findings can provide references for prevention and intervention to reduce the chronic course of depressive symptoms in the older Chinese population.",0.813413315

The largest group found (70.5% of participants) had a stable trajectory of low depressive symptoms (stable-low). The other four groups had symptom profiles that reached full-threshold levels at different developmental stages and for different durations. We identified the following groups: childhood-limited (5.1% of participants) with full-threshold symptoms at ages 11-13; childhood-persistent (3.5%) with full-threshold symptoms at ages 13-24; adolescent onset (9.4%) with full-threshold symptoms at ages 17-19; and early-adult onset (11.6%) with full-threshold symptoms at ages 22-24. Relative to the majority 'stable-low' group, the other four groups all exhibited higher risks of one or both adult outcomes.Accurate identification of depressive symptom trajectories requires data spanning the period from early adolescence to early adulthood. Consideration of changes in, as well as levels of, depressive symptoms could improve the targeting of preventative interventions in early-to-mid adolescence.",0.812678737

We used six time-point data derived from the 2012 to 2017 Multicultural Adolescents Panel Study (MAPS). Latent growth curve modeling was used to assess the overall features of depressive symptom trajectories in multicultural adolescents, and latent class growth modeling was used to determine the number and shape of trajectories. We applied multinomial logistic regression analysis to each class to explore predictive factors. We found that the overall slope of depressive symptoms in multicultural adolescents increased. Latent class analysis demonstrated three classes: (1) high-increasing class (i.e., high intercept, significantly increasing slope), (2) moderate-increasing class (i.e., moderate intercept, significantly increasing slope), and (3) low-stable class (i.e., low intercept, no significant slope). In particular, we found that the difference in the initial intercept of depressive symptoms determined the subsequent trajectory. There is a need for early screening for depressive symptoms in multicultural adolescents and preparing individual mental health care plans.",0.812219578

To identify distinct trajectories of depression experienced by a population-based sample of women over a 27-year period and to assess the validity of the derived trajectories. Method. The Mater University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy is a birth cohort study which commenced in 1981. Women ( N = 6753) were interviewed at their first clinic visit, at 6 months, then 5, 14, 21 and 27 years after the birth of their child, using the Delusions Symptoms – States Inventory. Some 3561 (52.7%) women were followed up at 27 years, with 3337 (49.4%) of the sample completing the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Depression trajectories over a 27-year period were identified using Latent Class Growth Modelling (LCGM). LCGM was used to identify respondents with similar patterns of depression over a 27-year period. At the 27-year follow-up women who completed the CIDI, were stratified according to their trajectory group membership. Results. Three trajectory groups, each with different life-course patterns of depression were identified. The low/no symptoms of depression trajectory group comprised 48.4% of women. The mid-depression group (41.7%) had a consistent pattern of occasional symptoms of depression. The high/escalating trajectory group comprised 9.9% of the women in the study. We then examined each trajectory group based on their completion of the CIDI at the 27-year follow-up. Using the CIDI, 27.0% of women in the study had met the DSM-IV criteria for lifetime ever depression by their mean age of 46.5 years. The responses to the CIDI differed greatly for each of the trajectory groups, suggesting that the trajectories validly reflect different life histories of depression. The high/escalating trajectory group had an earlier age of first onset, more frequent episodes, longer duration of each episode of depression and experienced higher levels of impairment for their episodes of depression. For the high symptoms trajectory group, clinically significant depression is estimated to be experienced by women almost one in every 6 days of their life. Conclusion. While symptoms of depression are commonly experienced in a large community-based sample of women, a minority of women experience many episodes of depression in their lifetime. It is this group of women who are most impaired and should be of most concern, and who should be the main target of prevention and treatment initiatives.",0.812050871

We aimed to delineate anxiety trajectories over three time‐points in the first 6 months of the pandemic and identify baseline risk and resilience factors that predicted anxiety trajectories. Within weeks of the pandemic onset, we established a website ( covid19resilience.org ), and enrolled 1362 participants ( n = 1064 from US; n = 222 from Israel) who provided longitudinal data between April–September 2020. We used latent growth mixture modelling to identify anxiety trajectories and ran multivariate regression models to compare characteristics between trajectory classes. A four‐class model best fit the data, including a resilient trajectory (stable low anxiety) the most common ( n = 961, 75.08%), and chronic anxiety ( n = 149, 11.64%), recovery ( n = 96, 7.50%) and delayed anxiety ( n = 74, 5.78%) trajectories. Resilient participants were older, not living alone, with higher income, more education, and reported fewer COVID‐19 worries and better sleep quality. Higher resilience factors' scores, specifically greater emotion regulation and lower conflict relationships, also uniquely distinguished the resilient trajectory. Results are consistent with the pre‐pandemic resilience literature suggesting that most individuals show stable mental health in the face of stressful events. Findings can inform preventative interventions for improved mental health.",0.811591764

Although women are generally considered at increased PTSD risk, sex and gender differences in PTSD symptom trajectories have not yet been extensively studied.To perform an in-depth investigation of differences in PTSD symptom trajectories across one-year post-trauma between men and women, by interpreting the general trends of trajectories observed in sex-disaggregated samples, and comparing within-trajectory symptom course and prevalence rates.We included N = 554 participants (62.5% men, 37.5% women) from a multi-centre prospective cohort of emergency department patients with suspected severe injury. PTSD symptom severity was assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-trauma, using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV. Latent growth mixture modelling on longitudinal PTSD symptoms was performed within the sex-disaggregated whole samples. Bayesian modelling with informative priors was applied for reliable model estimation, considering the imbalanced prevalence of the expected latent trajectories.In terms of general trends, the same trajectories were observed for men and women, i.e. resilient, recovery, chronic symptoms and delayed onset. Within-trajectory symptom courses were largely comparable, but resilient women had higher symptoms than resilient men. Sex differences in prevalence rates were observed for the recovery (higher in women) and delayed onset (higher in men) trajectories. Model fit for the sex-disaggregated samples was better than for the whole sample, indicating preferred application of sex-disaggregation. Analyses within the whole sample led to biased estimates of overall and sex-specific trajectory prevalence rates.Sex-disaggregated trajectory analyses revealed limited sex differences in PTSD symptom trajectories within one-year post-trauma in terms of general trends, courses and prevalence rates. The observed biased trajectory prevalence rates in the whole sample emphasize the necessity to apply appropriate statistical techniques when conducting sex-sensitive research.Antecedentes: Los últimos años han demostrado una mayor aplicación de enfoques prospectivos orientados a la trayectoria para el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT). Aunque generalmente se considera que las mujeres tienen un mayor riesgo de TEPT, las diferencias de sexo y género en las trayectorias de los síntomas del TEPT aún no se han estudiado ampliamente.Objetivo: Realizar una investigación en profundidad de las diferencias en las trayectorias de los síntomas del TEPT a lo largo de un año después de un trauma entre hombres y mujeres, interpretando las tendencias generales de las trayectorias observadas en muestras desagregadas por sexo, así como comparar el curso y la evolución de los síntomas dentro de la trayectoria y las tasas de prevalencia.Método: Incluimos N = 554 participantes (62.5% hombres, 37.5% mujeres) de una cohorte prospectiva multicéntrica de pacientes del servicio de urgencias con sospecha de lesión grave. La gravedad de los síntomas del TEPT se evaluó 1, 3, 6 y 12 meses después del trauma, utilizando la Escala de TEPT administrada por un médico para el DSM-IV. Se realizó un modelo de mezcla de crecimiento latente sobre los síntomas longitudinales de TEPT en las muestras desagregadas por sexo y en la muestra completa. Se aplicó un modelo bayesiano con antecedentes informativos para una estimación confiable del modelo, considerando la prevalencia desequilibrada de las trayectorias latentes esperadas.Resultados: En términos de tendencias generales, se observaron las mismas trayectorias para hombres y mujeres, es decir, resiliente, recuperación, síntomas crónicos y aparición tardía. Los cursos de síntomas dentro de la trayectoria fueron en gran medida comparables, pero las mujeres resilientes tenían más síntomas másque los hombres resilientes. Se observaron diferencias por sexo en las tasas de prevalencia para las trayectorias de recuperación (mayor en mujeres) y de inicio tardío (mayor en hombres). El ajuste del modelo para las muestras desagregadas por sexo fue mejor que para la muestra completa, lo que indica la aplicación preferida de la desagregación por sexo. Los análisis de la muestra completa llevaron a estimaciones sesgadas de las tasas de prevalencia de trayectorias generales y específicas por sexo.Conclusiones: Los análisis de trayectoria desagregados por sexo revelaron diferencias limitadas entre los sexos en las trayectorias de los síntomas del TEPT durante el año posterior al trauma en términos de tendencias generales, cursos y tasas de prevalencia. Las tasas de prevalencia de trayectoria sesgada observadas en el conjunto de la muestra enfatizan la necesidad de aplicar técnicas estadísticas apropiadas al realizar investigaciones que tengan en cuenta el sexo.背景: 近年来, 前瞻性轨迹导向方法在创伤后应激障碍 (PTSD) 中的应用有所增加。尽管通常认为女性 PTSD 有更高的风险, 尚未对 PTSD 症状轨迹中的性别和性别差异进行广泛研究。目的: 通过解读在性别分类样本中观察到轨迹的一般趋势, 以及比较轨迹内症状过程和流行率, 对创伤后一年内 PTSD 症状轨迹的男女差异进行深入考查。方法: 我们纳入了 N= 554 名参与者 (62.5% 男性, 37.5% 女性), 这些参与者来自多中心前瞻性队列疑似严重受伤的急诊科患者。在创伤后 1, 3, 6 和 12 个月, 使用DSM-IV临床用 PTSD 量表评估 PTSD 症状严重程度。在性别分类样本和整个样本中对纵向 PTSD 症状进行了潜在增长混合模型。考虑到预期潜在轨迹的流行率不平衡, 应用了具有信息先验的贝叶斯模型进行可靠模型估计。结果: 就总体趋势而言, 男性和女性观察到相同的轨迹, 即韧性, 恢复, 慢性症状和延迟发作组。轨迹内的症状过程在很大程度上具有可比性, 但韧性组女性比韧性组男性有更高的症状。在恢复组 (女性较高) 和延迟发病组 (男性较高) 轨迹中观察到流行率的性别差异。性别分类样本的模型拟合优于整个样本, 表明首选应用性别分类。对整个样本的分析导致对总体和特定性别轨迹流行率估计有偏。结论: 性别分类轨迹分析揭示了创伤后一年内 PTSD 症状轨迹在总体趋势, 病程和流行率方面的性别差异有限。在整个样本中观察到的有偏轨迹流行率强调了在进行性别敏感性研究时应用适当统计技术的必要性。.",0.810735064

Despite the importance of reparative skills, no study has charted the developmental trajectory of these behaviors or pinpointed predictors of poorer reparative abilities. To address these gaps in the literature, this study applied growth mixture modeling to parent reports of children's reparative behaviors (N = 230) in a 9-year longitudinal data set spanning from preschool to early adolescence. Three distinct trajectories of reparative behaviors were found: a low-stable, moderate-stable, and high-stable latent class. Poorer emotion understanding, social withdrawal, social rejection, and maladaptive guilt in the preschool period predicted membership in a low-stable reparative trajectory. Externalizing diagnoses, particularly conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, also predicted membership in a low-stable reparative trajectory. Preschool-onset depression predicted membership in a low-stable reparative trajectory through high levels of maladaptive guilt. The findings from this study suggest that socioemotional deficits in the preschool period set children on longstanding trajectories of impaired reparative responding. Thus, emotion understanding, social functioning, maladaptive guilt, and early psychiatric symptoms should be targeted in early preventive interventions.",0.809699611

Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM) analysis was used to estimate trajectories of self-esteem in grades 1~4. Using multiple logistic regression, the identified trajectories were then used to analyze whether the mother’s parenting, children’s happiness, and school adjustment affected the latent class classification.Results: First, the self-esteem of grades 1 to 4 revealed a linear growth pattern over time. Second, GMM identified four developmental trajectories in childhood self-esteem, of which the low-increasing, low-decreasing, high-increasing, or moderate-decreasing group reflected the normative trajectories. Third, the mother’s warm parenting, the academic performance of school adjustment, and the happiness of the children were significant in predicting the classification of latent class in the change trajectories of self-esteem.Conclusion: The results showed individual differences and heterogeneity in the development of selfesteem. Groups’ initial different developmental levels at first grade continue until grade 4. Developmental trajectories provide the direction for interventions by the level of self-esteem for elementary children. Especially, educational programs and interventions in mothers’ warm parenting, children’s happiness, and academic performance, which affect self-esteem trajectories, would be needed. These findings provide a meaningful foundation for designing programs and practical suggestions to encourage the self-esteem of elementary children.",0.808855524

This study was conducted to identify patterns of post‐traumatic stress symptoms and post‐traumatic growth and examine the predictors for the patterns among children and adolescents following an earthquake. Method Self‐reported measures (post‐traumatic stress symptoms, post‐traumatic growth, disaster exposure, and social support) were assessed among a total of 618 participants (age 12.26 ± 2.75) at 8 months post disaster. Latent profile analysis was utilized to identify the patterns of post‐traumatic stress symptoms and post‐traumatic growth, and multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to examine the predictors for the patterns. Results Three patterns were identified. Most of the participants fell into the Thriving pattern and smaller proportions fell into either the Resilient or Stressed and Growing pattern. Loss and injury, subjective fear, and social support could predict the membership in patterns of post‐traumatic stress symptoms and post‐traumatic growth.

In a sample of 500 adults who lost their jobs, trajectories of depression severity from four years before to four years after job loss were identified using Latent Growth Mixture Modeling. Rates of unemployment by trajectory were compared at two and four years following job loss. Four trajectories demonstrated optimal model fit including resilience (72%), chronic pre-to-post job loss depression (9%), emergent depression (10%), and remitting depression (9%). Logistic regression comparing reemployment status by class while controlling for age, gender, and education at two-years post job loss revealed no significant differences by class. An identical logistic regression on four-year reemployment revealed significant differences by class with post-hoc analyses revealing emergent depression resulting in a 33.3% reemployment rate compared to resilient individuals (60.4%) together indicating that depression affects reemployment rather than lack of reemployment causing the emergence of depression. The emergence of depression following job loss significantly increases the risk of continued unemployment. However, observed high rates of resilience with resulting downstream benefits in reemployment mitigates significant concern about the effects of wide spread unemployment on ongoing global economic recovery following the Great Recession.",0.808505246

The study population included 3,199 adult Registry enrollees who completed three surveys prior to Sandy in 2003–4, 2006–7, and 2011–12; a post-Hurricane Sandy survey (2013); and a follow-up survey in 2015–16. PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Checklist (PCL). Latent class growth analysis was used to identify groups of enrollees who shared a similar trajectory of change in PCL score in the time period prior to Sandy. We compared enrollees in each trajectory group to assess the impact of Sandy-related PTSD, Sandy exposures, and optimism on 9/11-related PTSD status post-Sandy (2015–16) using bivariate analyses and multivariable log-binomial regression. Sandy-related PTSD was the strongest predictor of subsequent 9/11-related PTSD. Lower optimism and higher Sandy exposure significantly predicted 9/11-related PTSD only in some trajectory groups. Hurricane Sandy may have exacerbated previously resolved symptoms of 9/11-related PTSD.

Although psychiatric symptoms may improve or worsen over time, relatively little is known about the course of PPD symptoms and possible fluctuations. Methods We applied a person-centered approach to examine PPD symptom patterns across pregnancy and childbirth. 824 women were assessed at three time points: first trimester (T1), third trimester (T2), and again at eight weeks (T3) postpartum. We assessed PPD symptoms, maternal mental health history, and childbirth variables. Results Growth mixture modeling (GMM) analysis revealed four discrete PPD symptom trajectory classes including chronic PPD (1.1%), delayed (10.2%), recovered (7.2%), and resilient (81.5%). Delivery complications were associated with chronic PPD but also with the recovered PPD trajectory class. History of mental health disorders was associated with chronic PPD and the delayed PPD class. Conclusion The findings underscore that significant changes in a woman's depression level can occur across pregnancy and childbirth. While a minority of women experience chronic PDD, for others depression symptoms appear to significantly alleviate over time, suggesting a form of recovery. Our findings support a personalized medicine approach based on the woman's symptom trajectory. Future research is warranted to identify the mechanisms underlying modifications in PPD symptoms severity and those implicated in recovery.",0.80680521

We examined: (Q1) Symptom trajectories of pain, fatigue, insomnia, breast, and arm symptoms in BC survivors, (Q2) possible patterns or cluster-like associations between trajectory classification of different symptoms, and (Q3) characteristics of survivors assigned to high-burden symptom trajectories.Participants were 968 women (mean age = 59.6 years) treated for early-stage BC and followed across a three-year postoperative period. As part of routine follow-up procedures, patients reported symptom burden and functioning levels at each hospital visit using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the BC-specific module (QLQ-BR-23). Growth mixture modeling (GMM) analysis was used to differentiate potential subgroups of individuals with similar longitudinal symptom patterns, i.e., symptom trajectories (Q1). With this approach, groups experiencing persistent, highly distressing cancer- and treatment-related late effects (LEs) may be identified. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used for Q2 and logistic regression analysis for Q3.GMM identified two relatively parallel trajectories across the tested symptoms: The majority of the sample exhibited a low-burden symptom trajectory (74.4-89.2%) and a minority by a high-burden symptom trajectory (10.8-25.6%). LCA revealed that approximately one in five women (18.8%) were likely to be members of the high-burden symptom trajectory across all tested symptoms. In addition to a high probability of being burdened over time across multiple symptoms, these women were also characterized by poorer self-reported physical and social functioning.A substantial minority followed a high-burden symptom trajectory for several years following BC treatment. Associations were found in trajectory classification across symptoms, indicating that cancer-related LEs appear in clusters of multiple concurrent symptoms.",0.806617691

The current study modeled trajectories of changes in distress over a 5-year period among resettled refugees and sought to explicate post-settlement factors that influence distress over time. A large-scale sample of refugees resettled in Australia (2,399) was tracked over a 5-year period, completing measures of psychological distress at each wave and initial risk and protective factors immediately after resettlement. A latent class growth analysis conducted on distress found four unique classes characterized by (1) resilient levels of distress, (2) consistent clinical distress, (3) recovering levels of distress, and (4) deteriorating distress. Lower perceived discrimination and greater positive context of reception predicted membership to the resilient group and differentiated the recovering and deteriorating groups. Further, lower ingroup social support predicted membership to the clinically distressed group relative to all others. We conclude by echoing calls to strengthen community support for refugees and promote ingroup ties, particularly among those who are the most vulnerable.",0.806535404

Results: Two TBI trajectories—normal limits (70.8%) and clinically elevated (29.2%)—and 3 OI trajectories—normal limits (20.9%), subclinical (49.0%), and clinically elevated (30.17%)—were identified. Baseline GEC was the only predictor of class membership for all models. Both TBI trajectories demonstrated an increase in GEC over time, whereas only 1 of the 3 OI classes demonstrated this pattern. Family variables were associated with GEC across trajectories. Conclusion: The lack of association of injury characteristics with trajectory class membership highlights the heterogeneity in recovery after pediatric TBI. Associations of EF trajectories with family factors underscore the importance of involving the family in interventions for children with traumatic injuries.",0.806001083
https://openalex.org/W4210790267,10.31234/osf.io/eb3vj,Late adolescent outcomes of different developmental trajectories of ADHD symptoms in a large longitudinal study,"Background: There exists substantial heterogeneity in the developmental trajectories of ADHD symptoms, with distinctions often made between persistent versus remittent, and early- versus late-onset. However, how these trajectories relate to late adolescent functioning and whether, in particular, later onset trajectories mark a milder subtype remains unclear. Methods: We applied latent class growth analysis to data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 16,703) to evaluate whether developmental trajectories of ADHD symptoms (ages 3-17) were associated with differing levels of impairment in peer problems, mental health, substance use, and delinquency at age 17. Results: Our optimal model included five trajectory groups, labelled unaffected (37.6%), mildly affected (34.8%), subclinical remitting (14.4%), adolescent onset (7.6%), and stable high (5.6%). Adolescent onset and stable high trajectories were similarly impaired across all outcomes, other than substance use. Subclinical remitting individuals were impaired on self-esteem and well-being compared to unaffected individuals. Conclusions: By adolescence, those with a later onset have similar impairments to those following an early onset/persistent trajectory. Residual impairment remains for those on a remitting trajectory.",0.80551053

This study aimed to (a) document acute and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in parents of children with various life-threatening illnesses; (b) identify trajectory patterns of parental PTSS and recovery over 18 months; (c) determine psychosocial, demographic, and illness factors associated with trajectory group membership.In total, 159 parents (115 mothers, 44 fathers) from 122 families participated in a prospective, longitudinal study that assessed parent psychological responses across four time points-at diagnosis, and 3, 6, and 18 months later. Children were admitted to the Cardiology, Oncology, and Pediatric Intensive Care Departments in a tertiary pediatric hospital. The primary outcome was parent PTSS.Three distinct parent recovery profiles were identified-""Resilient,"" ""Recovery,"" and ""Chronic."" The ""Resilient"" class (33%) showed low distress responses across the trajectory period, whereas the ""Recovery"" class (52%) showed significantly higher levels of distress at the time of diagnosis that gradually declined over the first months following their child's illness. Both of these classes nevertheless remained within the normative range throughout. In contrast, the ""Chronic"" class (13%) was consistently high in severity, remaining within the clinical range across the entire period. Psychosocial factors such as mood, anxiety, and emotional responses predicted group membership, whereas demographic and illness factors did not.Parents show considerable resilience in the face of children's life-threatening illnesses. Early assessment of parent psychosocial factors may aid identification of those who would benefit from early intervention.",0.805479813
https://openalex.org/W2343665217,10.1037/tra0000087,PTSD symptom course during the first year of college.,"In this study we examined patterns of transition in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms over the 1st year of college. We also examined 2 factors that might predict these transitions: trauma exposure and alcohol involvement.Matriculating students (N = 944; 65% female) completed assessments of PTSD, trauma exposure, and alcohol use and consequences multiple times in their freshman year. Three symptom classes (no symptoms, moderate symptoms, and severe symptoms) were identified. Examination of transitions from 1 status to another was conducted with latent transition analysis.These models revealed considerable variability in the course of PTSD symptoms. The most common pattern was resolution, yet a significant portion of students showed other patterns. Symptom worsening was more commonly observed in the 2nd semester. Trauma exposure had a deleterious effect on PTSD symptom change trajectories, as did alcohol involvement, though less consistently so.Interventions that focus on the timing and correlates of symptom progression may benefit college students with posttraumatic distress.

A comprehensive way to understand posttrauma psychopathology is through symptom trajectories. The study aimed to look at the developmental courses of PTSD and depression symptoms in the initial months posttrauma, and their interrelationship in children and adolescents by utilizing advanced group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM). Methods: Two-hundred-and-seventeen children and adolescents aged between eight and 17 exposed to single-event trauma were included in the study. Their PTSD and depression symptoms were measured at two weeks, two months and nine months, with further psychological variables measures at the two-week assessment. Results: The GBTM modeling yielded a three-group model for PTSD and a three-group model for depression. All participants’ PTSD symptoms reduced to non-clinical level by nine months: participants were observed to be resilient (42.4%) or to be able to recover within two months (35.6%), while 21.9% experienced high level PTSD symptoms but recovered in nine months time. The depression trajectories described a chronic non-recovery depression group (20.1%) and two mild symptom groups (45.9%, 34.0%). Further analysis showed high synchronicity between PTSS and depression groups but predictor analysis revealed disparate predictors. Perievent panic (CPP), appraisal (CPTCI), rumination and thought suppression at week two predicted slow recovery from PTSS, while pre-trauma wellbeing (CPAS), post-trauma anxiety (SCAS) and appraisal (CPTCI) predicted chronic depression. Conclusions: Posttrauma depression was more persisting than PTSD symptoms at nine months in the sampled population. Cognitive appraisal may be central to explaining PTSD-depression comorbidity.",0.804964295

Participants completed Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaires at baseline, three, six, and 12 months. Latent class growth analysis identified health status trajectories; multinomial logistic regression models identified predictors of trajectory membership.ResultsPatients (n = 384) were primarily men (97%) and older (mean age 67.6 ± 10.1). Three health status trajectories were identified. All three trajectories improved at three months; however, the marked improvement health status trajectory (n = 19) showed progressive improvement over one year, whereas the poor (n = 119) and moderate (n = 246) health status trajectories had little change after three months. In adjusted analyses, worse baseline depression (odds ratio 1.10; 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.20), symptom burden (1.45; 1.15–1.83), and sense of peace (0.41; 0.22–0.75) predicted membership in the poor vs. moderate health status trajectory.ConclusionWe identified three one-year health status trajectories in patients with heart failure, with the two most common trajectories characterized by early improvement followed by limited change. Future research should assess these findings in nonveterans and women and explore whether treatment of depression, high symptom burden, and low sense of peace leads to improved long-term heart failure health status trajectory.",0.803842558

In addition, missing from the literature is a comprehensive examination of predictors and longitudinal consequences of particular depression trajectories.Participants in this study included a community cohort of 501 women assessed for depression using the Center for Epidemiologic Depression Scale at infant age 2, 18, 36, and 54 months. A multi-informant approach was used to examine predictors and outcomes of trajectory membership.Using growth mixture modeling, three distinct trajectories emerged: 84% of the sample demonstrated low-stable levels of depressive symptoms, 9.5% had high-decreasing scores, and 6.5% had moderate-increasing scores. While socioeconomic status and marital conflict differentiated the low-stable group from the high-decreasing and moderate-increasing group, neighborhood collective efficacy differentiated the latter two groups. At 54 months, a clustering of family risks was prevalent for the moderate-increasing depression group, including higher marital conflict and household chaos, lower parental positivity, and heightened levels of child psychopathology.Limitations include reliance on self-reports to assess maternal depression and the relatively small sample size of certain trajectory classes.The onset and course of maternal depression in the early childrearing period is heterogeneous, with distinct subgroups in the population. Comprehensive assessment of individual, family, and neighborhood stressors augments our understanding of the predictors and consequences of trajectory membership over this critical period of child and family adaptation.",0.802999617

Participants: Four hundred and eighty-eight first- and second-year undergraduate students completed measures of depressive symptoms and LTPA at the beginning, middle, and end of a semester. Methods: Latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) was conducted. Results: On average, students reported mild levels of depressive symptoms with significant variability at the semester start, but the symptoms elevated over time. LGMM identified two trajectories: low/gradual (75.8%) and high/increasing (24.2%). For both groups, neither vigorous nor moderate LTPA development predicted the growth trajectory of depressive symptoms. However, the change of light LTPA was negatively and significantly associated with the growth trajectory. Even when controlling for covariances, increased light LTPA still had a unique effect on buffering depressive symptoms. Conclusion: There is great potential in targeting comprehensive LTPA strategies to improve college students’ mental health and promote an active lifestyle.Keywords: Mental healthphysical activitylatent growth mixture modeling Conflict of interest disclosureThe authors have no conflicts of interest to report.

Interviews were conducted by field workers applying measures of traumatic events (TEs), ongoing adversity, a sense of injustice, PTS symptoms and psychological distress.Latent transition analysis supported a 3-class longitudinal model (psychological distress, comorbid symptoms and low symptoms). We derived 4 composite trajectories comprising recovery (20.8%), a persisting morbidity trajectory (7.2%), an incident trajectory (37.2%) and a low-symptom trajectory (34.7%). Compared with the low-symptom trajectory, the persistent and incident trajectories reported greater stress arising from poverty and family conflict, higher TE exposure for 2 historical periods, and a sense of injustice for 2 historical periods. The persistent trajectory was unique in reporting greater TE exposure in the Indonesian occupation, whereas the incident trajectory reported greater TE exposure during the later internal conflict that occurred between baseline and follow-up. Compared with the low-symptom trajectory, the incident trajectory reported a greater sense of injustice relating to the periods of the Indonesian occupation and independence. The persistent trajectory was characterised by a sense of injustice relating to the internal conflict and contemporary times. The recovery trajectory was characterised by the absence of these risk factors, the only difference from the low-symptom trajectory being that the former reported a sense of injustice for the period surrounding independence.Our findings suggest that the timing of both TE exposure and the focus of a sense of injustice may differentiate those with persisting and new-onset mental health morbidity in settings of recurrent conflict.",0.802722931

The assumption is that the risk/need items on these tools are sufficiently sensitive to measure changes in the individual, family and/or contextual characteristics of juvenile offenders. However, there is very little research demonstrating the capacity of these tools to measure changes in juvenile offenders. Congruent with the developmental and life-course criminology theories (DLC) the objective of this study is to explore the existence of heterogeneous trajectories of juvenile offenders across the juvenile justice system as measured through five empirical risk/need areas based on the Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY), one of the most widely applied risk assessment tools for juveniles.This longitudinal study included 5205 male juvenile offenders who transitioned through the Catalan juvenile justice system between 2006 and 2014. During intervention they received at least two, and a maximum of seven, consecutive SAVRY risk/need assessments over an 18-month period. The heterogeneity of latent class trajectories was explored through growth mixture modeling (GMM). The trajectory class membership was linked to covariates through multinomial logistic regression analyses.Through GMM three to four heterogeneous trajectories, with high quality of separation, were identified in each of the risk/need areas. The trajectories with low risk/needs (45-77% of the sample) remained low and presented a very limited increase in risk/needs during the 18-month period. The high risk/need trajectories (20-37% of the sample) showed a limited decrease or no change. Between 5 and 13% of the sample had large reductions in their risk/needs levels, and approximately 5% showed a large increase in risk/needs.In line with the DLC theories this study shows that trajectories on criminogenic risk/needs can be heterogeneous and indicate distinct rates of change over time. The results of this study also may suggest a limited sensibility to measure change over time of SAVRY's risk and protective items. Suggestions to improve the sensitivity of measuring change over time, such as shorter time frames or future-oriented time frames for the scoring of the items, are offered.",0.802558331

An examination of National Guard soldiers through the lens of posttraumatic growth,"National Guard soldiers experience unique reintegration challenges. In addition to managing the consequences of combat-related trauma, they also navigate multiple transitions between military and civilian life. Despite these obstacles, many soldiers report positive outcomes and personal growth due to deployment, a phenomenon most commonly referred to in the literature as posttraumatic growth (PTG). The current study explored PTG in National Guard soldiers using a multidimensional longitudinal approach, with the goal of validating reports of PTG in soldiers. Data were collected from National Guard soldiers at pre-deployment, reintegration, one year post-deployment and two years post-deployment. Informed by PTG theory, three PTG constructs were measured (perceived ability to handle stress, social support seeking, and purpose in life) at each of the four time points, with increases in these constructs indicating growth. Potential predictors of growth in these PTG constructs were also explored. Results from a repeated measure latent profile analysis indicated that PTG did occur in certain soldiers, and that higher optimism and less severe PTSD symptoms predict this growth. These findings emphasize the importance of making efforts to facilitate PTG in soldiers.",0.79976049

This study aimed to investigate the trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms and the role of self-compassion during the pandemic.In this one-year five-wave longitudinal study (retested every three months from February 2020 to February 2021), 494 Chinese college students completed the study through online questionnaires and provided information on depression and anxiety symptoms, self-compassion, and sociodemographic variables. Independent and joint trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms were explored by growth mixture models. Predictive effects of self-compassion on trajectories were examined by logistic regression models.Four and three heterogeneous latent trajectories were identified for depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Three distinct joint trajectories of depression and anxiety were determined: low symptoms group (54.0 %), mild symptoms group (34.4 %), and risk group (11.5 %). Participants with higher levels of self-compassion were more likely to follow the low symptoms trajectory of depression and anxiety symptoms (all p < 0.001).Group heterogeneity existed in the trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms.

However, reliance on endpoint outcomes ignores additional interindividual variation during therapy. Knowing a patient's likely symptom trajectories could guide clinical decisions. We aimed to identify latent classes of patients with similar symptom trajectories over the course of psychological therapy and explore associations between baseline variables and trajectory class.Patients received high-intensity psychological treatment for common mental health problems at National Health Service Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services in South London (N = 16 258). To identify trajectories, we performed growth mixture modelling of depression and anxiety symptoms over 11 sessions. We then ran multinomial regressions to identify baseline variables associated with trajectory class membership.Trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms were highly similar and best modelled by four classes. Three classes started with moderate-severe symptoms and showed (1) no change, (2) gradual improvement, and (3) fast improvement. A final class (4) showed initially mild symptoms and minimal improvement. Within the moderate-severe baseline symptom classes, patients in the two showing improvement as opposed to no change tended not to be prescribed psychotropic medication or report a disability and were in employment. Patients showing fast improvement additionally reported lower baseline functional impairment on average.Multiple trajectory classes of depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with baseline characteristics.

The aims of this study were to describe and evaluate possible differences in long-term mental health symptoms after a major avalanche disaster between exposed and unexposed soldiers using a longitudinal design. Present mental health symptoms were examined among avalanche exposed (n = 12) and unexposed (n = 9) soldiers by PTSS-10, IES-15 and STAI-12 in four waves (1986–1987 and 2016). Binary logistic regression revealed that the odds to score above the cut-off were significantly lower for both groups after one year compared to baseline for PTSS-10 (p = 0.018) and significantly lower after 30 days compared to baseline for IES-15 (p = 0.005). Data did not reveal significant differences between the exposed and unexposed groups regarding adjusted PTSS-10, IES-15 or STAI-12 mean scores compared. Linear mixed model-analyses revealed significant effects of time. The adjusted mean scores declined over time for both groups: PTSS-10 (p = 0.001), IES-15 (p = 0.026) and STAI-12 (p = 0.001), and the time trajectories for PTSS-10 were significantly different between the groups (p = 0.013). Although not significant (all p > 0.05), results indicated that a larger proportion of soldiers in the exposed group experienced posttraumatic stress symptoms (5/12) (PTSS-10 score ≥ 4) and distress symptoms (6/12) (IES-15 score ≥ 26) above cut-off points, 30 years post-disaster. The course of mental health symptoms may persist, and even increase, in selected and trained military personnel 30 years after exposure to a natural disaster.

The study's objectives were to (1) identify trajectories of long-term functional limitations after injury in the older adult population to better characterize the recovery process and (2) predict which individuals are most at risk for poor functional trajectories after injury.A retrospective cohort study was conducted using six waves of data from the Health and Retirement Study, which surveys Americans older than 50 years every two years. A group-based trajectory model was used to identify trajectories of functional limitations in injured participants. Using multivariate regression, we identified significant predictors of each trajectory.Five distinct trajectories were identified: Trajectory 1--consistently low functional limitations scores (18.9%), Trajectory 2--increase in functional limitations after injury followed by a gradual, incomplete recovery (46.3%), Trajectory 3--increase in functional limitations followed by further decline in functioning (10.5%), Trajectory 4--increase in functional limitations after injury followed by a gradual, complete recovery (13.4%), and Trajectory 5--consistently high functional limitations scores (10.8%). Gender, multiple health conditions, and insurance status predicted trajectory membership.Functional limitations after injury follow distinct trajectories that can be predicted by baseline individual characteristics.",0.796285594

One hundred forty-eight patients with moderate-severe TBI were assessed at 2, 5, 12, and ≥36 months post-injury on the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory. Clinical interviews obtained information about demographics, injury characteristics, and 1-year return to productivity. Latent growth mixture modeling identified trajectories of anxiety and depression across time. The three-step method identified predictors of trajectories, and χ2 analyses determined associations between trajectories and 1-year return to productivity. Analyses revealed that four-class models of anxiety and depression best fit the data. Most individuals had stable minimal (67%) or low (18%) levels of anxiety over time. Two other subsets of individuals were classified by anxiety that worsened rapidly (7%) or improved in the 1st year but worsened by 3 years post-injury (9%). Similarly for the depression trajectories, most individuals had stable minimal (70%) or low (10%) levels of depression over time. Others had depression that worsened rapidly (12%) or was delayed, with onset 1-year post-injury (8%). Predictors of worsening anxiety and depression included younger age, less education, and male gender. Those with worsening anxiety or depression were less likely to return to productivity by 1-year post-injury. There is a significant burden of anxiety (15%) and depression (20%) in the 3 years after moderate-severe TBI. Future research targeting at-risk patients may help to improve quality of life and functional recovery.",0.795794642
https://openalex.org/W4200073333,10.31234/osf.io/8scpx,Trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms during psychological therapy for common mental health problems,"Background: There is substantial variation in patient symptoms following psychological therapy for depression and anxiety. However, reliance on endpoint outcomes ignores additional interindividual variation during therapy. Knowing a patient’s likely symptom trajectories could guide clinical decisions.Aim: Identify latent classes of patients with similar symptom trajectories over the course of psychological therapy and explore associations between baseline variables and trajectory class. Method: Patients received high-intensity psychological treatment for depression or anxiety at NHS Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services in South London (N = 16,258). To identify trajectories, we performed growth mixture modelling of depression and anxiety symptoms over 11 sessions. We then ran multinomial regressions to identify baseline variables associated with trajectory class membership.Results: Trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms were highly similar and best modelled by four classes. Three classes started with moderate-severe symptoms and showed (1) minimal change, (2) gradual improvement, and (3) fast improvement. A final class (4) started with mild symptoms and demonstrated small improvement. Within the trajectory classes with moderate-severe baseline symptoms, patients in the two classes showing improvement as opposed to minimal change tended not to be prescribed psychotropic medication or report a disability and were in employment. Those showing fast improvement additionally reported lower baseline functional impairment on average. Conclusion: Multiple trajectory classes of depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with baseline characteristics. Identifying the most likely trajectory for a patient at the start of treatment could inform decisions about the suitability and continuation of therapy, ultimately improving patient outcomes.",0.79569177

However, there is limited knowledge about the way the ST develops over time, as well as its predictors. The current longitudinal study examined ST trajectories among spouses of Israeli war veterans with PTSS, as well as the contribution of veterans' PTSS and wives' assessment of veterans' PTSS to these trajectories.Data were collected from both spouses at 3 time points, 30, 35-37, and 42 years after the 1973 Yom Kippur War (2003, 2008-2010, and 2015, respectively).Using multiple-group Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA), we identified 4 distinct ST trajectories. The majority of wives (68%) were in the resilient group, 12% were in the recovery group, approximately 10% were in the chronic PTSS group and another 10% were in the delayed-onset group. Multinomial regressions revealed that veterans' PTSS predicted the 4 different trajectories among their wives. In addition, wives in the recovery and chronic groups who perceived their veteran husbands' PTSS to be higher also reported higher ST.This study highlights the complexity of the development of ST trajectories over time. Findings supports the idea of PTSS contagion, and reveals the contributing role of both objective and perceived levels of veterans' PTSS in ST. Therefore, implementing interventions aimed at alleviating both individual and couple-level distress may be warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).",0.793078883

Despite these risks, not all bereaved individuals experience these negative effects. Limited scientific consensus exists on how to define resilience in individuals who have experienced the death of a loved one. Methods Using a sample of N = 3766 youth from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort, we identified bereavement of a family member between ages 7 and 8.5. We derived and compared three different approaches to assess resilience among bereaved youth. Trajectory-based psychological resilience identified sub-groups with similar psychological symptom profiles between ages 6 and 16 using latent growth mixture models. Relative psychological resilience at age 16 leveraged standardized residuals from a model regressing psychological symptoms on bereavement to determine better-than-expected psychological functioning relative to bereavement status. Relative cross-domain resilience around age 16 was a sum score of the residuals approach applied to eight unique domains of health. Predictive validity of each approach was assessed using depressive symptoms at age 17.5 Results Overall, N = 877 (23%) youth were bereaved of a family member between ages 7 and 8.5. Using latent growth mixture models, a three-class solution described 84% of bereaved youth with low and stable psychological symptoms over time, 8% with worsening symptoms, and 8% with improving yet elevated symptoms. Each relative resilience score was largely concordant with the trajectory-based approach in identifying individuals as resilient or not, though relative psychological resilience demonstrated a stronger degree of concordance than the cross-domain score. Relative psychological and cross-domain resilience exhibited moderate to low correlation, depending on the domains included (r = 0.14–0.43). For each approach, resilience significantly predicted lower depressive symptoms at age 17.5, highlighting predictive validity of these measures. Conclusions Psychological symptom trajectories among bereaved youth aligned with those previously identified among bereaved adults. The residual-based approach to defining resilience exhibited limited utility in the context of bereavement. When identifying risk and resilience after bereavement, researchers and clinicians must address the interplay across psychosocial and physical health domains, as bereaved youth considered resilient from a mental health perspective may benefit from intervention in other domains.",0.79177308

A longitudinal study was conducted in 12,793 bus drivers in Guangdong province, China, at 3-year follow-up assessments. Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to estimate latent classes of burnout trajectories and multinomial logistic regression models were applied to predict membership in the trajectory classes. In general, there was a decrease in job burnout in 3 years [slope = -0.29, 95%CI = (-0.32, -0.27)]. Among those sub-dimensions, reduced personal accomplishment accounted for the largest proportion. GMM analysis identified five trajectory groups: (1) moderate-decreased (n = 2870, 23%), (2) low-stable (n = 5062, 39%), (3) rapid-decreased (n = 141, 1%), (4) moderate-increased (n = 1504, 12%), and (5) high-stable (n = 3216, 25%). Multinomial logistic regression estimates showed that depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and insomnia were significant negative predictors, while daily physical exercise was a significantly positive predictor. We found an overall downward trend in bus drivers' burnout, particularly in the sub-dimension of personal accomplishment. Mentally healthier drivers and those who were usually exercising were more resilient to occupational stress and less likely to suffer burnout.",0.791703368

Methods Data were obtained from four waves’ survey of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). A total of 3646 participants who aged 60 or older during baseline survey and completed all follow-ups were retained in this study. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 10-item version of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10). Growth mixture modelling (GMM) was adopted to identify the trajectory classes of depressive symptoms, and both linear function and quadratic function were considered. Multivariate logistic regression model was performed to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of associated factors to predict trajectory class of the participants. Results The four-class quadratic function model was the best fitting model of the trajectories of depressive symptoms in Chinese elderly population. The four trajectories were labelled increasing (16.70%), decreasing (12.31%), high and stable (7.30%) and low and stable (63.69%) according to their trends. Except low and stable trajectory, other trajectories were almost above the critical line of depressive symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression model suggested that trajectories of chronic depressive symptoms could be predicted by being female, living in village, having lower education level and suffering from chronic diseases. Conclusions This study identified four depressive symptoms trajectories in Chinese elderly population and analysed associated factors of trajectory class. These findings can provide references for the prevention and intervention work to reduce chronic course of depressive symptoms in Chinese elderly population.",0.791344663

Modeling of symptom growth trajectories facilitates understanding predictors of individual outcomes over time. Although growth mixture modeling (GMM) has been applied to military populations, few studies have incorporated both pre-deployment and follow-up measurements over an extended time. Methods In this prospective study, 1087 US Army soldiers with varying military occupational specialties and geographic locations were assessed before and after deployment to the Iraq War, with long-term follow-up assessment occurring at least five years after return from deployment. The primary outcome variable was the PTSD Checklist, civilian version, summary score. Results GMM yielded four latent profiles: (1) primarily asymptomatic (n = 194; 17·8%), (2) post-deployment worsening symptoms (n = 84; 7·7%), (3) mild symptoms (n = 320; 29·4%), and (4) pre-existing, with chronic post-deployment elevation of symptoms (n = 489; 45·0%). Regression models comparing the primarily asymptomatic class to symptomatic classes revealed that chronic symptom classes were associated with greater stress exposure, less pre-deployment social support, identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, military reservist or veteran status at most recent assessment, and poorer pre-deployment visual memory. Conclusions PTSD symptom course varies considerably over time after military deployment and is associated with potentially modifiable biopsychosocial factors occurring early in its course, in addition to exposures and military status.

We measured risky driving with the 21-item Checkpoints Self-Reported Risky Driving Scale (C-RDS). Using C-RDS data from W3-7, the latent class growth modeling (LCGM) was used to identify risky driving trajectory classes. Independent variables were W3 depressive symptoms and W3 psychosomatic symptoms. Covariates included family affluence and urbanicity. The LCGM was conducted with SAS PROC Traj. The multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine the associations between the trajectory classes and independent variables, taking complex survey sampling features into account.Three risky driving trajectories were identified: low (N = 583, 21.43%, weighted and hereafter), medium (N = 1423, 59.22%), and high (N = 389, 19.35%) risky driving classes. Compared to the low risky driving class, one unit increase in W3 depressive symptoms was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of belonging to the medium (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.04, 95% CI 1.01, 1.07) and the high (AOR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.02, 1.08) risky driving classes, respectfully, when controlling for the covariates. Likewise, compared to the low risky driving class, one unit increase in W3 psychosomatic symptoms was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of belonging to the medium (AOR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.00, 1.13) and the high (AOR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.04, 1.16) risky driving classes, respectively, when controlling for the covariates.High school students with depressive and psychosomatic symptoms were at higher risk of engaging in risky driving in the immediate years after leaving high school. These findings suggest that prevention programs that incorporate screening, referral to treatment, and treatment of mental and psychosomatic symptoms in high school may be important opportunities to reduce risky driving among youth as they transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood.",0.790603447

Latent class growth analysis was employed to identify depressive symptom trajectories across 2011, 2013, and 2015, and a three-step auxiliary approach was applied to detect predictive variables of latent class membership. Mixed Analysis of Variances was followed to make between-class comparisons on life satisfaction across time.Results: Four grieving trajectories were identified: resilient (54.6%), chronic grief (23.7%), depressed-improved (11.6%), and chronic depression (10.1%). Older age, living exclusively with spouse before widowhood, and agricultural Hukou were significant predictors of depressed-improved, chronic grief, and chronic depression patterns, respectively. Life satisfaction in all groups except for the resilient one remained stable across time, and that of the chronic depression group was significantly lower than those of all the remaining groups.Conclusion: Consistent depressive symptom trajectories during late-life widowhood exist across nations while the specific culture, values, and resources in the Chinese context may have contributed to a particularly high proportion of the chronic grief trajectory. More efforts should be made to identify patterns with predictors before support are provided, and interventions need to be tailored to target specific needs in each subgroup of the elderly during their transitions to widowhood.",0.788819103

We sought to identify distinct trajectories of distress during primary treatment into survivorship and to identify variables that are determinants of which patient follows which type of adjustment trajectory. Psychological distress was measured at four significant time points (after surgery/biopsy, at treatment completion, two and six months thereafter) among 181 newly diagnosed BC patients. A latent growth mixture modeling approach was used to identify distinct distress trajectories. Four distress trajectories were identified: a ‘resilient’ pattern (73.1%), a ‘high-remitting’ (7.7%) trajectory, a ‘delayed’ increase in distress (7.9%), and a constantly high ‘chronic’ distress (11.3%) pattern. High perceived burden from physical symptoms at treatment completion encompassed a higher chance for the ‘high-remitting’ and ‘chronic’ distress trajectory. High self-efficacy at baseline increased chances for the ‘high-remitting’ pattern. Neither type of treatment, demographic or medical characteristics, nor baseline distress reliably predicted distress trajectories. The majority of BC patients adjust well through a demanding treatment period. High patient-perceived burden from physical symptoms, and high coping self-efficacy is suggesting a transient, self-limiting distress trajectory, while patients experiencing constant ‘chronic’ distress, and those developing distress following treatment completion only cannot be identified by a single, initial assessment. Only systematic tracking with repeated measurement extending into survivorship can eliminate this problem. Interventions should aim at reducing the impact of symptom burden on women's every-day life and on strengthening coping-self efficacy.",0.788321959

Mothers were recruited in early pregnancy and data on demographic characteristics were collected during pregnancy. Trajectory patterns were investigated using latent class growth analysis, and risk factors for the derived trajectory classes were investigated by multinomial logistic regression.Participants were found to be a fairly representative sample with respect to their demographic characteristics. Five classes of high normal (11.5%), normal (49.2%), low normal (21.2%), delayed (14.1%), and markedly delayed (4.0%) were identified. The markedly delayed class was characterized by overall delay from the early developmental stages; notably, such delay first became salient in motor domains and was then exceeded by language domains, especially receptive language. This class was predicted by male sex (odds ratio 4.0; 95% confidence interval 1.7-9.1), small for gestational age (2.8; 1.0-7.5), low placenta-to-birthweight ratio (2.8; 1.2-6.4) and low maternal education (4.7; 1.2-19.0). The delayed class was characterized by gradual downward deviation after the first birthday, and was predicted by male sex (2.5; 1.5-4.2), preterm birth (4.4; 1.6-12.6) and advanced paternal age (1.9; 1.0-3.5).Our results demonstrate that about 1 out of 5 infants exhibits delayed neurodevelopment.

It remains relatively unclear what characterizes these potentially different response trajectories ( Chen & Bonanno, 2020). This study sought to (a) assess individuals' PTSS levels at the start of the pandemic and at two subsequent timepoints 3 and 6 months later, (b) identify different trajectories of PTSSs over time, and (c) describe which individual characteristics influenced the likelihood of each of these different trajectories to occur.A community sample (n = 317) responded to an online survey during the first weeks of the pandemic, 3 and 6 months later.Among those who reported acute levels of PTSSs, latent class growth analyses identified three different resilience trajectories-resilient (low baseline PTSSs and a slight decrease over time), chronic (severe PTSSs at baseline and no change over time), and recovered (severe PTSSs at baseline but a sharp improvement over time). Baseline childhood adversity, depression, anxiety, defensive functioning, and somatization predicted trajectories. Demographics (age, gender, preexisting chronic illness) and COVID-related factors (knowing someone diagnosed with or who died of COVID-19) were unrelated to trajectories.Results suggest that although high PTSS levels decreased over time on average, heterogenous change trajectories can be identified based on baseline psychological characteristics. This implies that mental health, including past and present experiences, as well as adaptational mechanisms may shape individuals' experiences with pandemic-related ongoing stress.

However, the role of SES in different trajectories of depressive symptoms in Chinese college freshmen has not been discovered. The present study aims to identify how depressive symptom trajectories are related to SES during the first semester of freshman. Six hundred fifty-two Chinese college freshmen (64.9% female) were followed 4 times across 4 months. The Latent Growth Mixture Model (LGMM) was used to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms. Multinomial Logical Regression was used to identify the influence of family socioeconomic status (FSES), subjective socioeconomic status (SSS), and demographic variables on trajectories of depressive symptoms for freshmen. Results found that college freshmen's depressive symptoms gradually decreased during the four tests, F(2.758, 1795.383) = 52.642, p < 0.001, and there are three trajectories of depressive symptoms: normal group (Class 1, 73.1%), depression risk group (Class 2, 20.7%), and depression deterioration group (Class 3, 6.1%). The decline of SSS predicted increasing depressive symptoms. Age and left-behind experience have significant effects on trajectories of depressive symptoms.

Resilience trajectories were modeled using the latent class growth analysis. Linear regressions were used to test the predictive effects of different resilience trajectories on subsequent PTG. Of 744 samples (Mage=15.44, SD = 0.66 at baseline), 59.1% were females. Three trajectories of resilience were identified, including low resilience (19.8%), moderate resilience (58.7%), and high resilience (21.5%). Highly resilient participants reported greater PTG 10 years later (β = 0.12, 95%CI 0.60-6.08) after adjusting for demographic variables, earthquake exposure, negative life events, and mental health problems. Moreover, the same findings only existed in males (β = 0.22, 95%CI 1.26-11.01). Our findings highlight the importance of classifying survivors by resilience trajectories in order to better account for different implications on future PTG. Moreover, sex-specific programs are needed to provide tailored intervention.",0.785253641

To most effectively prevent use, distinct trajectories of use must be identified as well as differential associations with predictors of use, such as leisure experience. The current study used a person‐centered approach to identify distinct substance use trajectories and how leisure is associated with trajectory classes. Data came from a larger efficacy trial of 2.249 South African high school students who reported substance use at any time across 8 waves. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify developmental trajectories of substance use and the influence of healthy leisure. Results identified three increasing and one stable substance use trajectory and subjective healthy leisure served to protect against use. This study is the first of its kind to focus on a sample of South African adolescents and serves to develop a richer understanding of substance use development and the role of healthy leisure.",0.785232298

C. Posttraumatic stress disorder in an urban population of young adults: Risk factors for chronicity. The American Journal of Psychiatry. 1992; 149: 671–675. [Google Scholar]). Latent Growth Mixture Modeling can be used to classify individuals into distinct groups exhibiting different patterns of PTSD (Galatzer-Levy, 2015 Galatzer-Levy I. Applications of Latent Growth Mixture Modeling and allied methods to posttraumatic stress response data. European Journal of Psychotraumatology. 2015; 6: 27515. http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/ejpt.v6.27515. [Google Scholar]). Currently, empirical evidence points to four distinct trajectories of PTSD patterns in those who have experienced burn trauma. These trajectories are labeled as: resilient, recovery, chronic, and delayed onset trajectories (e.g., Bonanno, 2004 Bonanno G. A. Loss, trauma, and human resilience: Have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely adverse events?. American Psychologist. 2004; 59: 20–28.

Psychological Medicine. 2013; 3: 1–15. [Google Scholar]). The delayed onset trajectory affects only a small group of individuals, that is, about 4–5% (O'Donnell, Elliott, Lau, & Creamer, 2007 O'Donnell M. L., Elliott P., Lau W., Creamer M. PTSD symptom trajectories: From early to chronic response. Behaviour Research and Therapy. 2007; 45: 601–606. [Google Scholar]). In addition to its low frequency, the later onset of this trajectory may contribute to the fact that these individuals can be easily overlooked by professionals. In this special symposium on Estimating PTSD trajectories (Van de Schoot, 2015a Van de Schoot R. Latent Growth Mixture Models to estimate PTSD trajectories. European Journal of Psychotraumatology. 2015a; 6: 27503. http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/ejpt.v6.27503. [Google Scholar]), we illustrate how to properly identify this small group of individuals through the Bayesian estimation framework using previous knowledge through priors (see, e.g., Depaoli & Boyajian, 2014 Depaoli S., Boyajian J.

We demonstrate and compare results from traditional (maximum likelihood) and Bayesian estimation using priors (see, Depaoli, 2012 Depaoli S.

Further, we discuss where priors come from and how to define them in the estimation process.ResultsWe demonstrate that only the Bayesian approach results in the desired theory-driven solution of PTSD trajectories. Since the priors are chosen subjectively, we also present a sensitivity analysis of the Bayesian results to illustrate how to check the impact of the prior knowledge integrated into the model.ConclusionsWe conclude with recommendations and guidelines for researchers looking to implement theory-driven LGMM, and we tailor this discussion to the context of PTSD research.",0.78513561

We assessed CR and ES at February 2020 and PTG at August 2020. Growth mixture modeling was used to classify the PTS symptom trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression was used to recognize the predictors of class membership. The relationships among PTS symptoms, CR, ES, and PTG were examined using multi-group path analysis.Results: Sex, SARS-CoV-2 infection of a family member or friend, number of siblings, CR, and ES were significantly associated with PTS symptoms. Three latent classes were identified: ‘Increasing PTS’ (n=205, 10.0%) who had rapid deterioration of PTS symptoms, ‘Moderate PTS’ (n=149, 8.0%) who had a high level of PTS symptoms at the beginning and slightly increasing, and ‘Persistent Minimal PTS’ (n=1 633, 82.0%), who had slow resolution of PTS symptoms over time. Male, SARS-CoV-2 infection of a family member or friend, and having a lower CR and a higher ES, were more likely to have ‘Increasing PTS’. PTS at February 2020 predicted PTG only in ‘Increasing PTS’ class, and both CR and ES had moderating effects on the conversion between them.Conclusions: Most students recovered from posttraumatic stress of COVID-19 pandemic, but a small proportion expeienced increasing PTS symptoms, and those with this condition may benefit from emotional regulation intervention.",0.7830071

One possible way to prevent mental health problems is to build-up coping resources that promote resilience to the effects of disaster work. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a resilience building workshop, the Disaster Worker Resiliency Training Program (DWRT), in disaster workers previously exposed to Hurricane Sandy. Disaster workers (N = 167) were randomly assigned to the DWRT workshop (n = 78) or a waitlist (n = 89). Workers completed self-report measures on healthy lifestyle behaviors, perceived stress, depression, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms at baseline and 3-month follow-up. They also completed a measure assessing subsequent trauma-exposure between the baseline and 3-month post-intervention. Participants in the workshop condition, as compared to those in a waitlist control, reported significantly greater improvements from pre-intervention (T1) to 3-month follow-up (T2) in healthy lifestyle behaviors (η2 = .03; p = .03), stress management (η2 = .03, p = .04), and spiritual growth (η2 = .03, p = .02). Among participants reporting subsequent trauma exposures between T1 and T2 (n = 101), participants in the waitlist condition, were more likely to report significant increases in perceived stress (η2 = .07, p < .01), PTSD (η2 = .05, p = .03), and depression (η2 = .07, p < .01) symptoms.

Methods: Longitudinal data were used from the Mexican Health and Aging Study. Trajectories were estimated using latent class growth analysis. Internal and socio-ecological resources were analyzed as predictors of the trajectories. Results: Unfavorable (worsening of symptoms and chronic high symptoms) and favorable (improvement of symptoms and stable low symptoms (resistance)) trajectories were identified. Favorable trajectories were more likely for daily disability. Persons who showed resistance in depression also tended to show resistance in daily disability. Net worth, cognition, and subjective well-being were early predictors for most trajectories. Discussion: Besides resistance, individuals rather show different co-occurring trajectories in the studied outcomes.

Knowledge on key characteristics that are associated with courses of disability could identify patients at risk for less favorable outcome. This knowledge will help improve shared decision-making.Adult patients with LBP completed questionnaires on disability (Pain Disability Index) and LBP impact (Impact Stratification of the National Institutes of Health minimal dataset) at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months' follow-up. Latent class analyses were applied to identify trajectories of disability and LBP impact. Baseline sociodemographic and clinical patient characteristics were compared between trajectory subgroups.Follow-up was available for 996 patients on disability and 707 patients on LBP impact. Six trajectories were identified for both outcome measures. Three disability trajectories remained stable at distinct levels of severity (68% of patients) and three trajectories showed patterns of recovery (32%). For LBP impact there was one stable trajectory (17%), two slightly improving (59%), two recovering (15%), and one with a pattern of recovery and relapse (15%). Significant differences between trajectories were observed for almost all baseline patient characteristics.On average, patients show moderate improvements in disability and LBP impact 2 years after visiting a multidisciplinary tertiary spine center. However, latent class analyses revealed that most patients belong to subgroups experiencing stable levels of disability and LBP impact. Differences in baseline patient characteristics were mostly associated with baseline levels of functioning, instead of (un)favorable outcome during follow-up.2.",0.781861809

This study aimed to identify change trajectories of mental health during treatment. Method: Longitudinal data of 442 patients was used with five time points during a year of outpatient treatment. ED psychopathology and well-being were used as primary measures. A series of latent growth mixture models were applied to model trajectories of change. Results: Three latent classes were found for ED psychopathology and well-being. For ED psychopathology, a high baseline severity and slow recovery class (55.9% of the patients), a high baseline severity followed by a substantial recovery class (19.9%) and a moderate baseline severity and no significant recovery class (24.2%) were found. For well-being, a low baseline followed by a slow growth class (44.6%), a low baseline and substantial growth class (9.5%) and a moderate and stable well-being class (45.9%) was found. General psychopathology, early symptom change, hope for recovery, intrinsic motivation and the ED type were predictive of class membership in either ED psychopathology or well-being. Conclusions: This study shows variability in ED psychopathology and well-being change trajectories, modelled in meaningful latent recovery classes.

https://openalex.org/W2980980453,,Trajectories of Burden and Depression in Caregivers Following Traumatic Injury: The Role of Resilience,"As part of an effort to understand psychological consequences among family members of patients sustaining a traumatic injury, medical research has turned to the role of resilience – or the ability to bounce back from and maintain psychological well-being in the wake of an adverse event— in mitigating the potential distress (i.e., depression and burden) of caregiving (Bonanno, 2004; Roberson et al., under review). This study sought to examine the ability for trait-resilience to predict trajectories of distress over the course of a year among 124 family members and loved ones of patients admitted to a Level I Trauma Center. A cross-lagged path model examining resilience, burden, and depression at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after injury showed that, while depression strongly predicted later burden, resilience was not a significant predictor of either outcome in the model. When depression and burden were subjected to a person-centered analysis (i.e., latent growth curve analysis), two major classes were identified: caregivers with high, chronic distress (33% of the sample) and low-moderate distress that declined over time. A three-class solution for caregiver burden further identified a moderate, increasing trajectory class. Predictive discriminant analyses revealed that trait-resilience was a major differentiating trait between class membership (rs = .23 for depression; rs = .32 for burden); further, presence of PTSD symptoms at baseline, gender, and history of depression were shown to be strong factors in distinguishing class membership across both outcomes. This study helps shed insight into the well-being of caregivers in the wake of a loved one's traumatic injury, in addition to possible identifying risk factors while patients are still admitted in the ICU. Lastly, the study provides alternatives for analyses that focus on longitudinal outcomes, particularly person- vs. variable-centered solutions.",0.781278033

Methods: This study used data from the first, second, and fourth to seventh waves of the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey 2010. The subjects included 1,793 adolescents. The data were analyzed using latent class growth analysis in Mplus 8.3 and multinomial logistic regression in SPSS 26.0. Results: The trajectories of ego-resiliency in adolescents were classified into four groups; increasing, decreasing, persistently moderate, and persistently poor. The predictors of the ‘increasing’ group were male gender, higher self-esteem, lower depression, lower parental behavior, and higher perceived community. The predictors of the ‘decreasing’ group were higher self-esteem, higher scores for relationships with friends and teachers, and higher perceived community. The predictors of the ‘persistently poor’ group were lower self-esteem, higher depression, lower annual income, lower scores for relationships with friends, and lower perceived community. Conclusion: We identified predictors for a persistently poor ego-resiliency trajectory.

However, it is unclear whether these traits are preexisting risk factors or if event-related changes might also be associated with PTSD symptoms over time. Therefore, the current aim was to assess if military deployment is associated with changes in cooperativeness and self-directedness and to study how these traits are related to PTSD symptom trajectories.In a large cohort of military personnel (N = 1007), measurements were performed before, at one and six months, and two and five years after deployment to Afghanistan. Linear mixed-effect models were used to assess the individual change in the traits over time and to study the relation with potential predictors.Cooperativeness was found to remain stable, whereas self-directedness was found to slightly decrease over time. This decrease was related to the development of PTSD symptoms over time. Furthermore, lower levels of self-directedness were associated with the symptomatic trajectories of PTSD symptoms. Lower levels of cooperativeness were only associated with the recovered PTSD trajectory.So, not only do the findings confirm that lower levels of these character traits are associated with the development of PTSD symptoms, it was also shown that there are differences in the relation between these traits and the course of PTSD symptoms. Studying methods to promote the levels of these character traits might help to improve the resiliency of military personnel.",0.78112999

This study examined the relative impact of trajectories of maternal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms from mid-pregnancy to early childhood on child communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal social development at three years of age.Data were analyzed from 1983 mother-child dyads who participated in the three-year follow-up of the All Our Families (AOF) study. Maternal distress and child development across five domains were measured using validated tools. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify trajectories of maternal distress over time. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between the trajectories and child development while adjusting for the covariates.At age three years, 5.2% of children were at risk communication delay; 12.7% for gross motor delay; 15.4% for fine motor delay; 11.2 for problem solving delay; and 5.6% for personal-social delay on ASQ-3 domains. Multivariable analysis showed children born to mothers with persistent high anxiety symptoms from pregnancy to 3-years postpartum had an increased risk of delays in communication and personal-social domains.The use of self-reported maternal mental health symptoms and maternal reported child development are the study limitations.The impact of high levels of maternal anxiety symptoms on the increased risk of child developmental delay in communication and personal-social domains highlights the importance of early intervention and addressing maternal anxiety from pregnancy through early childhood.",0.780712856

It is important to determine for whom these treatments work and to examine predictors of success. Method An 8-week modified prolonged exposure (PE) treatment, including components of behavioral activation and reducing the number of imaginal exposure sessions, was administered to a sample of 231 Veterans (mean age = 45.7 years, standard deviation = 14.89). Growth mixture modeling was used to model PTSD symptom trajectories across the 8-week intervention and a postintervention appointment. Further, baseline demographics, social support, clinician-rated PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and depression were examined as predictors of trajectories. Results Three classes emerged, labeled responders (n = 35), nonresponders (n = 190), and immediate responders (n = 6). The only significant baseline difference between responders and nonresponders was higher anxiety symptoms in the nonresponders. At follow-up time points, there were higher levels of clinician-rated PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms and lower social support in the nonresponders compared to the responders. Conclusion Findings suggest that modifying standard PE treatments by reducing imaginal exposure sessions while adding behavioral activation may not be advisable for most Veterans with PTSD.",0.78038455

Post-ACS depression typically resembles one of four longitudinal trajectories: chronic; absent; recovered, or delayed depression. Early identification of a patient's post-ACS depression trajectory will improve risk stratification, treatment implementation and risk management. Purpose To explore whether stable psychosocial traits, such as resilience, predict the trajectory of depression one month and 6 months following an ACS admission. Method Consecutive adult ACS patients (STEMI/NSTEMI) admitted to a large general hospital completed the Cardiac Depression Scale (CDS) and the Sense of Coherence scale during their admission, then one and six months following discharge. Results 132 ACS in-patients (males = 111; mean age = 63.13±13.47) satisfied enrolment criteria. Unconditional linear latent growth modelling identified a 3-class model for the trajectory of depression post-ACS (increasing depression; consistent non-depressed; decreasing non-depressed). For the increasing depression class, resilience at baseline was significant and negative compared to the consistent class, b=−0.06, Wald chi square (1) = 4.42, p=0.036 and the decreasing class, b=−0.09, Wald chi square (1) = 7.20, p=0.007. Conclusions Patients who reported lower levels of resilience during an ACS admission were significantly more likely to experience initially high levels of depressive symptoms (CDS ≥85) that exceeded the clinically relevant cut-off (CDS ≥95) at 6 months post-discharge. This study suggests that screening for resilience and depression will improve risk stratification for persistent and delayed depression post-ACS.",0.778431695

A total of 391 college students recruited from China completed a daily online negative and positive affect scale for 1 week, and their resilience was also measured. Profiles of brief trajectories of negative and positive affect over time were identified using the latent growth mixture model, and the effect of resilience on these trajectories was further explored. Two latent profiles of negative affect were found: a constant high negative affect profile and a slowly decreasing low negative affect profile, while three latent profiles of positive affect were identified: a slowly increasing high positive affect profile, a rapidly decreasing medium positive affect profile, and a constant medium positive affect profile. The optimism dimension of resilience predicted the membership in the various profiles significantly, whereas the prediction of tenacity and strength dimensions of resilience was not significant. Activities that promote resilience, especially optimism, should be included to improve the daily emotions of college students during COVID-19.",0.778041872

Children having more siblings at home were more likely to belong to the medium decreasing and high decreasing trajectory groups, whereas children older at asthma diagnosis were less likely to belong to the medium decreasing and high decreasing trajectory groups than the low increasing trajectory group.ConclusionOur results suggest that children with incident asthma follow 3 distinct trajectories of asthma exacerbations after asthma diagnosis. The trajectory group with initial moderate exacerbation probability has better long-term prognosis.",0.776843724

However, little is known about the earlier developmental course of anxiety in preschool, especially in at risk children, posing a clinically important problem. Given that anxiety in youth has a chronic course for some and also predicts later development of other mental health problems, it is important to identify factors early in development that may predict chronic anxiety symptoms. At-risk children (oversampled for depression) and caregivers completed 6 assessment waves beginning at preschool age (between 3–5.11 years of age) up through 6.5 years later. Growth mixture models revealed 4 distinct trajectories: 2 stable groups (high and moderate) and 2 decreasing groups (high and low). Important to note, the high stable anxiety group had greater baseline depression and social adversity/risk, higher average maternal depression over time, and poorer average social functioning over time compared to the high decreasing group. The high decreasing group also had greater externalizing/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder scores than the low decreasing group. Children with anxiety in early childhood who also experience high depression, social adversity/risk, maternal depression, and poor social functioning may be at risk for chronic symptoms over time.",0.776454591

A registry-sampled cohort study,"Research suggests variation in how grief develops across time, and gender may account for some of this variation. However, gender differences in growth patterns of the newly codified ICD-11 prolonged grief disorder (PGD) are unknown. This study examined gender-specific variances in grief trajectories in a registry-sampled cohort of 857 spousal bereaved individuals (69.8% female). Participants completed self-report questionnaires of PGD symptoms at 2, 6, and 11 months post-loss. Using Growth Mixture Modeling, four PGD trajectories emerged: resilient characterized by low symptoms (64.4%), moderate-stable characterized by moderate symptoms (20.4%), recovery characterized by elevated symptoms showing a decrease over time (8.4%), and prolonged grief characterized by continuous elevated symptoms (6.8%). Similar proportions of men and women comprised the four trajectories. Gender influenced the parameter estimates of the prolonged grief trajectory as men evidenced more baseline symptoms (higher intercept) than women did and a decreasing symptom-level (negative slope), while women showed symptom-increase over time (positive slope). The prolonged grief trajectory captured the largest proportion of probable PGD cases in both genders. Low optimism and low mental health predicted membership in this class. Altogether, the absolute majority of both men and women followed a low-symptom resilient trajectory. While a comparable minority followed a high-symptom prolonged grief trajectory, men and women within this trajectory expressed varying symptom development. Men expressed prolonged grief as an acute, decreasing reaction, whereas women showed an adjourned, mounting grief reaction. This study suggests that gender may influence symptom development in highly distressed individuals across early bereavement.",0.774630393

However, prior research and theory suggest that the modal postdisaster response in each of these domains is resilience, defined as low levels of symptoms or problems in a given outcome over time, with minimal elevations that are limited to the time period during the disaster and its immediate aftermath. However, the extent to which disaster survivors exhibit mental health wellness (resilience across multiple mental health conditions) or general wellness (resilience across mental health, physical health, and role functioning domains) remains unexplored. The purpose of this study was to quantify mental health and general wellness, and to examine predictors of each form of wellness, in a three-wave population-based study of Hurricane Ike survivors (N = 658). Latent class growth analysis was used to determine the frequency of resilience on four outcomes (PTSS: 74.9%; depression: 57.9%; functional impairment: 45.1%; days of poor health: 52.6%), and cross-tabulations were used to determine the frequency of mental health wellness (51.2%) and general wellness (26.1%). Significant predictors of both mental health and general wellness included lower peri-event emotional reactions and higher community-level collective efficacy; loss of sentimental possessions or pets and disaster-related financial loss were negative predictors of mental health wellness, and loss of personal property was a negative predictor of general wellness. The results suggest that studies focusing on a single postdisaster outcome may have overestimated the prevalence of mental health and general wellness, and that peri-event responses, personal property loss and collective efficacy have a cross-cutting influence across multiple domains of postdisaster functioning.",0.774449752

Identifying factors that predict maintenance of gains after treatment can help triage individuals who may need additional services.Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to identify classes of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptom trajectories across the year following a 2-week IOP, delivering daily PE for PTSD for post-9/11 Veterans. Predictors of trajectories were examined.Three classes of trajectories best-fit the data for PTSD and depression symptoms. Two classes made up the majority of the sample (85%) and both maintained significantly reduced PTSD symptoms across the year following therapy. For a minority of the sample (14.6%), PTSD symptoms rebounded after treatment. These individuals were highly likely to be categorized in the persistent depression class.IOP-delivered PE is effective, and gains are largely maintained. The minority of patients who do not maintain their gains as robustly are likely to report persistent depressive symptoms in treatment and higher PTSD symptoms on a self-report measure.",0.773093301

However, the extent of association and attribution to subsequent disability has varied, with limited studies conducted in urban low-income contexts. This longitudinal study estimated the trajectory of PTSD symptoms up to 7 months after hospitalization and the associated disability level among adult patients who had been hospitalized due to injury. Adult injury patients (N = 476) admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, were interviewed in person in the hospital, and via phone at 1, 2-3, and 4-7 months after hospital discharge. Using latent growth curve modeling, two trajectories of PTSD symptoms emerged: (a) persistently elevated PTSD symptoms (9.2%), and (b) low PTSD symptoms (90.8%). Number of PTEs experienced remained moderately associated with the elevated trajectory after controlling for in-hospital depressive symptoms. Having previously witnessed killings or serious injuries, AOR = 2.32, 95% CI [1.07, 5.05]; being female, AOR = 4.74, 95% CI [4.53, 4.96]; elevated depressive symptoms during hospitalization, AOR = 2.96, 95% CI [1.28, 6.83]; and having no household savings/assets, AOR = 1.28, 95% CI [1.13, 1.44], were associated with the elevated PTSD symptoms trajectory class after controlling for other risk factors. Latent membership in the elevated PTSD trajectory was associated with a significantly higher level of disability several months after hospital discharge, p < .001, after controlling for injury and demographic characteristics. These results underline the associations among in-hospital depressive symptoms, witnessing atrocities, and poverty, and an elevated PTSD symptoms trajectory.Spanish Abstracts by Asociación Chilena de Estrés Traumático (ACET) Exposición al trauma, Trayectoria de los síntomas del trastorno de estrés postraumático y nivel de discapacidad entre los Sobrevivientes de lesiones hospitalizados en Kenia TRAYECTORIAS DE LOS SíNTOMAS DE TEPT EN SOBREVIVIENTES DE TRAUMAS DE KENIA Los eventos potencialmente traumáticos (EPT) se han asociado sistemáticamente con el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT).

However, evidence is lacking with respect to how anger changes over a deployment cycle, and which factors prospectively influence change in anger among combat-deployed soldiers. Methods Reports of problematic anger were obtained from 7298 US Army soldiers who deployed to Afghanistan in 2012. A series of mixed-effects growth models estimated linear trajectories of anger over a period of 1–2 months before deployment to 9 months post-deployment, and evaluated the effects of pre-deployment factors (prior deployments and perceived resilience) on average levels and growth of problematic anger. Results A model with random intercepts and slopes provided the best fit, indicating heterogeneity in soldiers' levels and trajectories of anger. First-time deployers reported the lowest anger overall, but the most growth in anger over time. Soldiers with multiple prior deployments displayed the highest anger overall, which remained relatively stable over time. Higher pre-deployment resilience was associated with lower reports of anger, but its protective effect diminished over time. First- and second-time deployers reporting low resilience displayed different anger trajectories (stable v . decreasing, respectively). Conclusions Change in anger from pre- to post-deployment varies based on pre-deployment factors. The observed differences in anger trajectories suggest that efforts to detect and reduce problematic anger should be tailored for first-time v . repeat deployers. Ongoing screening is needed even for soldiers reporting high resilience before deployment, as the protective effect of pre-deployment resilience on anger erodes over time.",0.772479242

We aimed to delineate distinct anxiety-response trajectories during the early stages of the pandemic and to identify baseline risk and resilience factors as predictors of anxiety responses. Methods Using a crowdsourcing website, we enrolled 1,362 participants, primarily from the United States (n = 1064) and Israel (n = 222) over three time-points from April-September 2020. We used latent growth mixture modeling to identify anxiety trajectories over time. Group comparison and multivariate regression models were used to examine demographic and risk and resilience factors associated with class membership. Results A four-class model provided the best fit. The resilient trajectory (stable low anxiety) was the most common (n = 961, 75.08%), followed by chronic anxiety (n = 149, 11.64%), recovery (n = 96, 7.50%) and delayed anxiety (n = 74, 5.78%). While COVID-19 stressors did not differ between trajectories, resilient participants were more likely to be older, living with another person and to report higher income, more education, fewer COVID-19 worries, better sleep quality, and more dispositional resilience factors at baseline. Multivariate analyses suggested that baseline emotion regulation capabilities and low conflictual relationships uniquely distinguished participants in distinct trajectories. Conclusions Consistent with prior resilience research following major adversities, a majority of individuals showed stable low levels of low anxiety in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge about dispositional resilience factors may prospectively inform mental health trajectories early in the course of ongoing adversity.",0.772239986

Five-year follow-up after the 2011 great east Japan earthquake and tsunami: Iwanuma Study,"Few studies have tracked the long-term mental health outcomes following major disaster. We sought to document the trajectories of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in the aftermath of the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami. A cohort of community-dwelling older adults were followed for 5.5 years after the disaster at 3 waves (2010, 2013 and 2016). Depressive symptoms were measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form, while PTSS was assessed by the Screening Questionnaire for Disaster Mental Health. We examined the trajectories of mental illness symptoms based on the probabilities of persistence, recovery, and delayed onset. Among people without pre-disaster depressive symptoms, 13.6% had developed depressive symptoms 2.5 years after the disaster. Of these, half of those had recovered and half had persisted at the 5.5 year follow-up. 11.1% of survivors reported post-traumatic stress symptoms in 2013; of these, 58% recovered by 2016, while 4.8% experienced delayed onset. Job loss was associated with persistent PTSS (OR 2.03; 95%CI 1.01-4.12) while a drop in subjective economic status predicted delayed onset of PTSS (OR 2.13; 1.34-3.39). However, disaster-related experiences were unrelated to the trajectory of depressive symptoms at 5.5 years. The probabilities of remission (58%) and delayed onset (5%) of PTSS are consistent with prior disaster research. The experience of job loss and drop in subjective economic status appeared to exert a lingering influence on the persistence or delayed onset of PTSS. Depressive symptoms after the disaster had remitted in roughly half of the survivors after 5.5 years.",0.772069319

Data analysis included latent class growth with time-varying covariate, univariate, and multivariate analysis.A three-class (""low but increasing trajectory,"" ""moderate and stable trajectory,"" and ""high but decreasing trajectory"") model fit the data of the cohort. Our findings indicated that 29%, 38%, and 33% of the adolescents were in the low but increasing, moderate and stable, and high but decreasing trajectories, respectively. After confounders were controlled for, bullying experiences were identified as a risk factor for depressive symptoms. The protective factors against depressive symptoms included resilience and peer and social support.The transitions between different educational stages critically influence the depressive symptoms of adolescents, and the adolescents follow different depressive trajectories, that have different etiology. Therefore, identifying adolescents at high risk for depression and designing student-centered intervention programs through individualized and multidimensional assessment of depressive symptoms are crucial for adolescents.",0.771976637

Although older adults are thought to make more use of these coping strategies than those at younger ages, less is known about how patterns of use change during the span of older adulthood. In a largely Christian sample of U.S. older adults, positive and negative religious coping were measured between 2 and 5 times over a period of 11 years (N = 1,075). Growth mixture modeling extracted latent classes of growth. The optimal solution for positive coping indicated a five-class structure (high, stable; high, declining moderately; high, declining rapidly; low, increasing; and low, stable) and the optimal negative coping solution had three classes (low, declining; low, increasing; and high, declining). Nominal logistic regression examined the relationship of individual characteristics with latent class. Education, religious commitment, religious attendance, and religious doubt were related to positive coping trajectory class. Only religious doubt was related to negative coping class.",0.771911963

Previous studies have highlighted the negative effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) more than the positive changes, such as post-traumatic growth (PTG). Furthermore, most previous studies were cross-sectional surveys without follow-ups. This study draws on PTG follow-up during the COVID-19 outbreak at 12-month intervals for 2 years since 2020. The trajectories and baseline predictors were described.A convenience sampling method was used to recruit frontline nurses or doctors at the COVID-19-designated hospital who were eligible for this study. A total of 565 HCWs completed the 2 years follow-up and were used for final data analysis. The latent growth mixture models (GMM) was used to identify subgroups of participants with different PTG trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression model was used to find predictors among sociodemographic characteristics and resilience at baseline.Four trajectory PTG types among HCWs were identified: 'Persistent, ""Steady increase"", ""High with drop"", and ""Fluctuated rise."" Comparing the ""Persistent low"" type, the other three categories were all associated with older age, higher education. Furthermore, ""Persistent low"" was also negatively associated with resilience at baseline.The PTG of HCWs with different characteristics showed different trends over time. It is necessary to increase the measure frequency to understand the PTG status in different times. Improving HCW's resilience could help improve staff PTG.",0.771774414

However, it is not clear how different parenting styles are jointly influencing the development of children's MHS over the course of childhood. Hence, the differential effects of parenting style on population heterogeneity in the joint developmental trajectories of children's internalising and externalising MHS were examined.A community sample of 7507 young children (ages 3, 5 and 9) from the Growing Up in Ireland cohort study was derived for further analyses. Parallel-process linear growth curve and latent growth mixture modelling were deployed.The results indicated that the linear growth model was a good approximation of children's MHS development (CFI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.03). The growth mixture modelling revealed three classes of joint internalising and externalising MHS trajectories (VLMR = 92.51, p < 0.01; LMR = 682.19, p < 0.01; E = 0.86). The majority of the children (83.49%) belonged to a low-risk class best described by a decreasing trajectory of externalising symptoms and a flat low trajectory of internalising MHS. In total, 10.07% of the children belonged to a high-risk class described by high internalising and externalising MHS trajectories, whereas 6.43% of the children were probable members of a mild-risk class with slightly improving yet still elevated trajectories of MHS. Adjusting for socio-demographics, child and parental health, multinomial logistic regressions indicated that hostile parenting was a risk factor for membership in the high-risk (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.18-1.85) and mild-risk (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.21-2.04) classes. Consistent (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.90) parenting style was a protective factor only against membership in the mild-risk class.In short, the findings suggest that a non-negligible proportion of the child population is susceptible to being at high risk for developing MHS. Moreover, a smaller proportion of children was improving but still displayed high symptoms of MHS (mild-risk). Furthermore, hostile parenting style is a substantial risk factor for increments in child MHS, whereas consistent parenting can serve as a protective factor in cases of mild-risk. Evidence-based parent training/management programmes may be needed to reduce the risk of developing MHS.",0.771591995

The aim of the current study was to test whether six hypothesized polygenic risk scores (PRSs) developed to capture genetic vulnerability to psychiatric conditions prospectively predict PTSD onset, severity, and 18-year course after trauma exposure. Methods Participants were 1490 responders to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster (mean age at 9/11 = 38.81 years, s.d. = 8.20; 93.5% male; 23.8% lifetime WTC-related PTSD diagnosis). Prospective longitudinal data on WTC-related PTSD symptoms were obtained from electronic medical records and modelled as PTSD trajectories using growth mixture model analysis. Independent regression models tested whether six hypothesized psychiatric PRSs (PTSD-PRS, Re-experiencing-PRS, Generalized Anxiety-PRS, Schizophrenia-PRS, Depression-PRS, and Neuroticism-PRS) are predictive of WTC-PTSD outcomes: lifetime diagnoses, average symptom severity, and 18-year symptom trajectory. All analyses were adjusted for population stratification, 9/11 exposure severity, and multiple testing. Results Depression-PRS predicted PTSD diagnostic status (OR 1.37, CI 1.17–1.61, adjusted p = 0.001). All PRSs, except PTSD-PRS, significantly predicted average PTSD symptoms ( β = 0.06–0.10, adjusted p &lt; 0.05). Re-experiencing-PRS, Generalized Anxiety-PRS and Schizophrenia-PRS predicted the high severity PTSD trajectory class (ORs 1.21–1.28, adjusted p &lt; 0.05). Finally, PRSs prediction was independent of 9/11 exposure severity and jointly accounted for 3.7 times more variance in PTSD symptoms than the exposure severity. Conclusions Psychiatric PRSs prospectively predicted WTC-related PTSD lifetime diagnosis, average symptom severity, and 18-year trajectory in responders to 9/11 disaster. Jointly, PRSs were more predictive of subsequent PTSD than the exposure severity. In the future, PRSs may help identify at-risk responders who might benefit from targeted prevention approaches.",0.771511183

Research indicates treatment response is a non-linear process characterized by combinations of gradual changes and abrupt shifts in depression symptoms, although less is known about differential trajectories of depression symptoms in therapist-supported digital mental health interventions (DMHI).Repeated measures latent profile analysis was used to empirically identify differential trajectories based upon biweekly depression scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) among patients engaging in a therapist-supported DMHI from January 2020 to July 2021. Multivariate associations between symptom trajectories with sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were examined with multinomial logistic regression. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were defined as a five-point change on the PHQ-9 from baseline to week 12.The final sample included 2192 patients aged 18 to 82 (mean = 39.1). Four distinct trajectories emerged that differed by symptom severity and trajectory of depression symptoms over 12 weeks. All trajectories demonstrated reductions in symptoms. Despite meeting MCID criteria, evidence of treatment resistance was found among the trajectory with the highest symptom severity. Chronicity of major depressive episodes and lifetime trauma exposures were ubiquitous across the trajectories in a multinomial logistic regression model.These data indicate that changes in depression symptoms during DMHI are heterogenous and non-linear, suggesting a need for precision care strategies to address treatment resistance and increase engagement. Future efforts should examine the effectiveness of trauma-informed treatment modules for DMHIs as well as protocols for continuation treatment and relapse prevention.",0.770500687

In recent studies, Mixed models are used to determine effects in the individual level. In the other hand, Henderson et al. [3,4] developed a joint likelihood function which combines likelihood functions of longitudinal biomarkers and survival times. They put random effects in the longitudinal component to determine if a longitudinal biomarker is associated with time to an event. In this paper, we deal with a longitudinal biomarker as a growth curve and extend Henderson's method to determine if a longitudinal biomarker is associated with time to an event for the multivariate survival data.",0.770304354

However, little is known about the long-term adjustment of hurricane-exposed individuals, especially with regard to positive outcomes, in the years after the storm. Specifically, few studies have measured posttraumatic growth (PTG), which refers to positive psychological change achieved by individuals who struggled with a traumatic experience. In their model of PTG, Tedeschi and Calhoun theorize that a certain level of trauma-related psychological distress and disruption is necessary for PTG to develop. The current study attempted to test the PTG model with a longitudinal path analysis of hurricane-exposed women. Results indicated that posttraumatic stress predicted general emotional distress at two distinct times. However, posttraumatic stress levels did not decrease with time as expected. PTG accounted for very little in the model. Posttraumatic stress symptoms did not predict future PTG, and PTG did not result in reduced levels of posttraumatic stress or emotional distress. Several possible explanations for these surprising results, including the lack of anticipated recovery, are discussed.",0.769915036

The heterogeneity of symptom development for serving and ex-serving personnel has not yet been compared in the UK Armed Forces (UK AF). Latent class growth modelling was employed to estimate the trajectories of PTSD symptoms from three waves of data from the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C) from a UK AF sample (N = 7357). Regression mixture models were conducted to investigate covariates of class membership. Five trajectory classes were identified. Most of the sample reported no-low symptoms (71.3%). Of those reporting probable PTSD during the 12 year-period, 4.6% showed improvements, 4.9% worsened, and 1.8% displayed chronic symptoms. A class with subthreshold elevated symptoms (17.3%) was also identified. Trajectories of serving and ex-serving personnel were not substantially different, but more ex-serving personnel were symptomatic and those with chronic symptoms worsened over time. Chronic disorder was associated with lower rank, experiencing violent combat, and proximity to wounding/death on deployment. Worsening symptoms were associated with childhood stress/violence, lower rank, not being in a relationship, inconsistent post-deployment social support, proximity to wounding/death, and voluntary, or medical discharge. The present study found most UKAF personnel did not report PTSD symptoms between 2004 and 16 but, among those experiencing probable PTSD, more participants reported deteriorating/persistent symptoms than who improved. PTSD-onset was related to adversities across childhood and deployment, and lack of social support. Findings underscore the importance of addressing the through-life contributors of PTSD in order to prevent ingrained disorder.",0.769688059

Moral injury, posttraumatic stress, and depression were assessed at ~9 months post-separation. We used Latent Growth Mixture Models to identify discrete classes characterized by unique trajectories of change in functioning over time and to examine predictors of class membership.Veterans were assigned to one of four functioning trajectories: high and stable, high and decreasing, moderate and increasing, and moderate and stable. Whereas posttraumatic stress, depression, and moral injury associated with perpetration and betrayal predicted worse outcomes at baseline across multiple functioning domains, moral injury associated with perpetration and depression most reliably predicted assignment to trajectories characterized by relatively poor or declining functioning.Moral injury contributes to functional problems beyond what is explained by posttraumatic stress and depression, and moral injury due to perpetration and depression most reliably predicted assignment to trajectories characterized by functional impairment over time.",0.767404089

This study aimed to assess long-term PTSS trajectories among ex-POWs and comparable veterans and the role of hardiness and sensation seeking in predicting PTSS trajectory. A sample of 189 Israeli ex-POWs and 160 comparable combatants participated in a 17 year longitudinal study with three waves of measurements following the 1973 Yom Kippur War (T1: 1991, T2: 2003, T3: 2008). Participants completed validated self-report measures. Latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) identified four longitudinal PTSS trajectories. Among ex-POWs, the majority of participants were classified in trajectories with ""low-increasing"" or ""medium-increasing"" levels of PTSS. Among the comparable veterans, however, the majority of participants were classified in a trajectory with ""low"" levels of PTSS. Ex-POWs with high levels of hardiness were less likely to belong to the ""high"" or ""medium-increasing"" PTSS trajectories, compared to the low-fluctuating trajectory. The long-term course of PTSS is heterogeneous among both veterans and ex-POWs, with chronic and increasing symptom patterns being more prevalent amongst ex-POWs. Ex-POWs should be considered an at-risk population for exacerbated PTSS trajectories that is related to hardiness personality construct.",0.767095105

It is meaningful to predict the trajectory of depressive symptoms in adolescents to find early intervention targets.Based on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, we included 4962 participants aged 9-10 who were followed-up for 2 years. Trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified by Latent Class Growth Analyses (LCGA). Four types of machine learning models were built to predict the identified trajectories and to obtain variables with predictive value based on the best performance model.Of all participants, 536 (10.80%) were classified as increasing, 269 (5.42%) as persistently high, 433 (8.73%) as decreasing, and 3724 (75.05%) as persistently low by LCGA. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model got the highest discriminant performance. Sleep quality, parental emotional state and family financial adversities were the most important predictors and three resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity data were also helpful to distinguish trajectories.We only have depressive symptom scores at three time points. Some valuable predictors are not specific to depression. External validation is an important next step. These predictors should not be interpreted as etiology and some variables were reported by parents/caregivers.Using GBM combined with baseline characteristics, the trajectories of depressive symptoms with two years among adolescents aged 9-10 years can be well predicted, which might further facilitate the identification of adolescents at high risk of depressive symptoms and development of effective early interventions.",0.766190331

This effect is often explained by disappointed expectations that are informed by previous job experiences. However, research has not established whether a hangover pattern could also be observed in individuals without previous work experience. We explored the development of job satisfaction with 4 assessment points across the first 4 months after starting vocational training among 357 Swiss adolescents. On average, a hangover pattern in job satisfaction was confirmed. Using person-centred growth mixture modelling, we identified two groups with distinct trajectories. Although a majority showed a hangover pattern, a third of participants showed stable, high job satisfaction. We presumed that adolescents with more contextual and personal resources (i.e., perceived social support, occupational self-efficacy, core self-evaluations, and perceived person–job fit) would be more likely to avoid a hangover pattern. Results confirmed that the two groups differed significantly in all these resources, with the high stable satisfaction group showing higher resources. The results illustrate the importance of a diverse set of resources to facilitate a positive trajectory of job satisfaction at the beginning of work life.",0.766182643

Latent growth mixture modeling indicated that three latent classes emerged (labeled resilient, at-risk, and normative). Follow-up analyses with covariates further supported the presence of these classes. The resilient class, of particular interest in this study, indicated high initial, but dramatically decreasing victimization coupled with high-stable prosocial behaviors over the 4-year period.

The current study examined longitudinal trajectories of PTSD and MDD symptoms among service members and veterans with comorbid PTSD/MDD. Methods Eligible participants ( n = 1704) for the Millennium Cohort Study included those who screened positive at baseline for both PTSD (PTSD Checklist–Civilian Version) and MDD (Patient Health Questionnaire). Between 2001 and 2016, participants completed a baseline assessment and up to 4 follow-up assessments approximately every 3 years. Mixture modeling simultaneously determined trajectories of comorbid PTSD and MDD symptoms. Multinomial regression determined factors associated with latent class membership. Results Four distinct classes (chronic, relapse, gradual recovery, and rapid recovery) described symptom trajectories of PTSD/MDD. Membership in the chronic class was associated with older age, service branch, deployment with combat, anxiety, physical assault, disabling injury/illness, bodily pain, high levels of somatic symptoms, and less social support. Conclusions Comorbid PTSD/MDD symptoms tend to move in tandem, and, although the largest class remitted symptoms, almost 25% of participants reported chronic comorbid symptoms across all time points. Results highlight the need to assess comorbid conditions in the context of PTSD. Future research should further evaluate the chronicity of comorbid symptoms over time.",0.764293986

In this study, we investigated trajectories of resilience and how these longitudinal patterns of resilience are related to changes in social relationships over time. Methods: This longitudinal study analyzed 4,299 early adolescents from waves 3-6 (sixth year of elementary school to third year of middle school) of the Seoul Education Longitudinal Study (SELS). A latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was conducted to empirically demonstrate latent development trajectories of adolescents’ resilience, and growth mixture model with known class was created to describe the relationship between resilience development trajectories and longitudinal change in social support systems (parent relationships, teacher relationships, peer relationships). Results: First, the developmental patterns of adolescents’ resilience varied over time; a total of six latent development trajectories were identified. The initial values of resilience by latent group were distributed over a wide range (high, middle-high, middle, middle-low, and low) and rate of change showed various patterns (decrease, decrease-increase, increase, and increase-decrease). Second, the patterns of change in social relationships (parents, teachers, peers) were similar to those of the resilience development trajectories. Third, among the three dimensions of social support, peer relationships showed the most similar patterns of change over time compared with other resilience development trajectories. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, differentiated interventions are required depending on the latent development trajectories of resilience, and adolescents should be provided with various opportunities to establish positive relationships with parents, teachers, and peers.",0.763279551

Vulnerable populations, such as people with low income and racial and ethnic minorities, are particularly prone to increased levels of physical harm and psychiatric adversity from weather-related events.Objectives: We aimed to explore psychosocial resources and coping of survivors with three different posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) trajectories (High-Decreasing, Moderate-Decreasing, and High-Stable), after Hurricane Katrina across two different time points: F1 (1-year post-disaster) and F3 (12 years post-disaster).Method: Participants in this multi-method study were part of a larger cohort of the Resilience in Survivors of Katrina (RISK) project. Transcripts of interviews completed at the two time points were analysed using two qualitative methods, combining thematic analysis and narrative analysis, and providing both breadth of perspectives with the depth of specific case studies.Results: Sixteen survivors completed interviews at both F1 and F3. From our in-depth analysis of the data, we derived five inductive themes: 'Hope,' 'Adaptive vs maladaptive avoidance,' 'Emotional delay,' 'Acceptance, Finding Meaning and Being in the Moment,' and 'Coping strategies.' Survivors with High-Decreasing and Moderate-Decreasing PTSS trajectories experienced hope for future, accepted the hurricane and its results, and found efficient ways to cope with their situation. Survivors with High-Stable PTSS trajectories tended to express a lack of hope for future and struggled to be mindful and accept the hurricane and its harm. Unlike survivors with High-Decreasing and Moderate-Decreasing PTSS trajectories, survivors with High-Stable PTSS trajectories also reported less social and family support and faced more discrimination and racism.Conclusion: There are factors beyond individual-level psychosocial resources that may shape post-disaster resilience. When supporting survivors after a weather-related disaster, it is essential to provide ongoing psychological, financial, and physical assistance to bolster these resources.After Hurricane Katrina, survivors with different posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories reported different levels of hope, mindfulness, and willingness to talk about the hurricane, emotional processing, and coping strategies.These experiences varied over time for survivors in all three trajectories.Survivors who report ongoing high levels of symptoms should be offered additional support to bolster these psychosocial resources.",0.763120319

Data were drawn from a 6-site randomized trial of collaborative primary care for PTSD and dpression in the military. Subjects were 474 soldiers with PTSD (scores ≥ 50 on the PTSD Checklist -Civilian Version). Four assessments were completed at U.S. Army installations: baseline, and follow-ups at 3 months (92.8% response rate [RR]), 6 months (90.1% RR), and 12 months (87.1% RR). Combat exposure and 7 validated indicators of baseline clinical status (alcohol misuse, depression, pain, somatic symptoms, low mental health functioning, low physical health functioning, mild traumatic brain injury) were used to predict PTSD symptom severity on the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (Cronbach's α = .87, .92, .95, .95, at assessments 1-4, respectively). Growth mixture modeling identified 2 PTSD symptom trajectories: subjects reporting persistent symptoms (Persisters, 81.9%, n = 388), and subjects reporting improved symptoms (Improvers 18.1%, n = 86). Logistic regression modeling examined baseline predictors of symptom trajectories, adjusting for demographics, installation, and treatment condition. Subjects who reported moderate combat exposure, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.44, 95% CI [0.20, 0.98], or who reported high exposure, OR = 0.39, 95% CI [0.17, 0.87], were less likely to be Improvers.

Understanding the heterogeneous courses of anxiety disorder symptoms during middle to late adolescence has the potential to clarify developmental risk models of anxiety and to inform prevention programs. Therefore, this study specifically examined gender differences in developmental trajectories of anxiety disorder symptoms (generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder) from middle to late adolescence in a diverse community sample (N = 1000; 57 % female; 65 % White), assessed annually over 2 years. Latent growth curve modeling revealed that girls exhibited a slight linear decrease in generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder symptoms, whereas boys exhibited a stable course. These models suggested that one trajectory was appropriate for panic disorder symptoms in both girls and boys. Growth mixture models indicated the presence of four latent generalized anxiety disorder symptom trajectory classes: low increasing, moderate decreasing slightly, high decreasing, and very high decreasing rapidly. Growth mixture models also suggested the presence of five latent social anxiety disorder symptom trajectory classes: a low stable trajectory class and four classes that were qualitatively similar to the latent generalized anxiety disorder trajectories. For both generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder symptoms, girls were significantly more likely than boys to be in trajectory classes characterized by moderate or high initial symptoms that subsequently decreased over time. These findings provide novel information regarding the developmental course of anxiety disorder symptoms in adolescents.",0.761422766

Researchers commonly evaluate symptom change during treatment using single model curves, however, modeling multiple curves simultaneously allows for the identification of subgroups of patients that progress through treatment on distinct paths.Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify and characterize distinct classes of symptom trajectories among two samples of patients with either MDD or GAD receiving treatment in a daily partial hospital program.Four depression symptom trajectories were identified in the MDD sample, and three anxiety symptom trajectories were identified in the GAD sample. Both samples shared symptom trajectory classes of responders, rapid responders, and minimal responders, while the MDD sample demonstrated an additional class of early rapid responders. In both samples, low symptom severity at baseline was associated with membership in the responder class, though few other patterns emerged in baseline characteristics predicting trajectory class membership. At treatment discharge, those in the minimal responder class reported poorer outcomes on every clinical measure. Patients within each class reported similar scores at discharge as compared to each other class, indicating that class membership affects clinical measures beyond symptom severity.Patient demographic characteristics were relatively homogeneous. Group-based trajectory modeling inherently involves some degree of uncertainty regarding the number and shape of trajectories.Identifying symptom trajectories can provide information regarding how patients are likely to progress through treatment, and thus inform clinicians when a patient deviates from expected progress.",0.761289768

The extent to which findings are relevant to other bereavements is uncertain. A major methodological limitation of current studies has been a reliance on retrospective reporting of functioning and use of samples of individuals who have self-selected for participant in grief research. To address these limitations, in the current study we applied Latent Growth Mixture Modelling (LGMM) in a prospective population-based sample to identify trajectories of depression following spousal and child bereavement in later life. The sample consisted of 2512 individual bereaved adults who were assessed once before and three times after their loss. Four discrete trajectories were identified: Resilience (little or no depression; 68.2%), Chronic Grief (an onset of depression following loss; 13.2%), Depressed-Improved (high pre-loss depression that decreased following loss; 11.2%), and Pre-existing Chronic Depression (high depression at all assessments; 7.4%). These trajectories were present for both child and spousal loss. There was some evidence that child loss in later life was associated more strongly with the Chronic Grief trajectory and less strongly with the Resilience trajectory. However these differences disappeared when covariates were included in the model. Limitations of the analyses are discussed. These findings increase our understanding of the variety of outcomes following bereavement and underscore the importance of using prospective designs to map heterogeneity of response outcomes.",0.761180479

Revision surgery, psychiatric history, preoperative chronic knee pain, and subsequent knee injury are associated with suboptimal recovery patterns. Sophisticated growth models can analyze patient recovery trajectories. Growth mixture models (GMM) treat a whole cohort as a single group and characterize that group over time, for example, over the course of knee injury and subsequent recovery after surgical reconstruction. Latent class growth analysis is a subcategory of GMM that sorts the cohort into subgroups and allows analysis regarding groups having, for example, standard, delayed, and suboptimal recoveries. This theoretically allows a physician to anticipate which patients are likely to follow a suboptimal trajectory of recovery, to track that recovery based on the model, and to form a treatment plan accordingly.",0.760726125

In the literature, there is relative consensus on how housing damage is shaped by pre-impact conditions at household and neighborhood levels. However, systematic longitudinal studies that compare the recovery trajectories of different types of housing are rare. Here, we examine long-term recovery trajectories after Hurricane Ike (2008) in Galveston, Texas using parcel level data for multifamily, single-family, and duplexes over an eight-year period. Overall, we found that recovery trajectories differed significantly across housing types. Multifamily housing and duplex homes recover more slowly compared to single-family houses after controlling for damage and socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods. These findings substantiate conclusions of previous research and call for disaster recovery assistance programs targeting recovery disparities among residential types to better ensure broad-based housing recovery.",0.760464438

Depression was assessed at four time points using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist among 288 women caring for a child 2–5 years old. Mixture modeling was used to estimate the number and nature of classes defined by trajectories of depressive symptoms over time. Maternal and child characteristics were explored as predictors of class. Three trajectories of symptoms of depression were identified; (1) stable-low, (2) moderate-subclinical, and (3) chronic-high. About 8% of women reported moderately or highly elevated symptoms at the first assessment and consistently onward (i.e. chronically). Higher anxiety levels, less social support, more functionality problems, and more executive behavior problems in children predicted membership in the moderate-subclinical and chronic-high classes. Identifying patterns of depression trajectories can help target intervention efforts for women who are likely to experience the most chronic and impairing symptomatology.",0.760388809

Yet, heterogeneity in the stress response regarding well-being in adults is not well understood. This study investigates effects of cumulative trauma on latent trajectories of two indices of well-being, subjective health and life satisfaction in a large representative sample by means of latent variable modelling techniques. Methods Data from the pairfam study wave 2–9, a longitudinal representative survey was used ( N = 10,825). Individuals reported on lifetime trauma type exposure on wave 7 and indicated levels of life satisfaction and health at each wave. Different types of latent Variable Mixture Models were applied in an iterative fashion. Conditional models investigated effects of cumulative trauma load. Results The best fitting model indicated three latent trajectories for life, and four for health, respectively. Trauma load significantly predicted class membership: Higher exposure was associated with non-stable trajectories for both indices but followed complex patterns of both improving and decreasing life satisfaction and health. Trauma load also explained variability within classes. Conclusions The current study expands on evidence to the long-term development of health and life satisfaction in response to traumatic events from a latent variable modelling perspective. Besides detrimental effect, it also points to functional adaptation after initial decline and increased well-being associated with trauma exposure.

Measuring PTSS trajectories could facilitate the development of targeted interventions to improve mental health outcomes for family caregivers of critically ill patients.To measure 6-month PTSS trajectories among caregivers of patients with acute cardiorespiratory failure.This prospective cohort study was conducted in the medical ICU of a large academic medical center among adult patients requiring (1) vasopressors for shock, (2) high-flow nasal cannula, (3) noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, or (4) invasive mechanical ventilation. Each patient was enrolled along with their primary caregiver, ie, the unpaid individual who provided the most physical, emotional, or financial support prior to ICU admission.Family caregiver PTSSs were assessed using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised within 48 hours of ICU admission, following ICU discharge, and 3 and 6 months after enrollment. Latent class growth analysis was used to measure PTSS trajectories. Preselected patient and caregiver characteristics measured at ICU admission were analyzed for association with trajectory membership. Six-month patient and caregiver outcomes were analyzed by caregiver trajectory.Overall, 95 family caregivers were enrolled and provided baseline data; mean (SD) age was 54.2 (13.6) years, 72 (76%) were women, 22 (23%) were Black individuals, and 70 (74%) were White individuals. Three trajectories were identified: persistently low (51 caregivers [54%]), resolving (29 [31%]), and chronic (15 [16%]). Low caregiver resilience, prior caregiver trauma, high patient severity of illness, and good patient premorbid functional status were associated with the chronic trajectory. Caregivers with the chronic PTSS trajectory had worse 6-month health-related quality of life (mean [SD] total 36-item Short Form Survey score, persistently low trajectory: 104.7 [11.3]; resolving trajectory: 101.7 [10.4]; chronic trajectory: 84.0 [14.4]; P < .001) and reduced effectiveness at work (mean [SD] perceived effectiveness at work score, persistently low trajectory: 86.0 [24.2]; resolving trajectory: 59.1 [32.7]; chronic trajectory: 72.3 [18.4]; P = .009).In this study, 3 distinct PTSS trajectories among ICU family caregivers were observed, with 16% of caregivers experiencing chronic PTSSs over the subsequent 6 months. Family caregivers with persistent PTSS had lower resilience, prior trauma, higher patient severity of illness, and higher baseline patient functional status compared with family caregivers with persistently low PTSS, with adverse effects on quality of life and work. Identifying these caregivers is an essential first step to develop interventions tailored to those with the greatest need for support.",0.758889206

This study investigates the association between fathers' mental health trajectories and key parenting behaviors (warmth, hostility, consistency) spanning the first 8-9 years postpartum. Secondary analyses of 5 waves of data from 2,662 fathers participating in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children were conducted. Latent growth class analysis was used to identify distinct trajectories of fathers' distress (Kessler-6; Kessler et al., 2003), and latent growth models estimated parenting warmth, hostility, and consistency. Multiple group analyses were conducted to describe and compare the course of parenting behaviors for fathers assigned to the distress trajectories identified. Two distinct classes of fathers were identified based on the trajectories of distress: minimal distress (92%) and persistent and increasing distress (8%). The latter group reported significantly lower parenting warmth when their children were 8-9 years and lower consistency and higher hostility across all study intervals. The postnatal and early parenting period is a critical time for the development of parenting behaviors that are important for children's development. Engagement and support for fathers around well-being and parenting is vital for promoting optimal family and child developmental outcomes.",0.758781653

It is known that individuals show heterogeneous trajectories of depressive symptoms following major life stressors, including chronic depression, recovery, and resilience. Although common genetic variation has been associated with depression risk, genomic factors that could help discriminate trajectories of risk vs resilience following adversity have not been identified.To assess the discriminatory accuracy of a deep neural net combining joint information from 21 psychiatric and health-related multiple polygenic scores (PGSs) for discriminating resilience vs other longitudinal symptom trajectories with use of longitudinal, genetically informed data on adults exposed to major life stressors.The Health and Retirement Study is a longitudinal panel cohort study in US citizens older than 50 years, with data being collected once every 2 years between 1992 and 2010. A total of 2071 participants who were of European ancestry with available depressive symptom trajectory information after experiencing an index depressogenic major life stressor were included. Latent growth mixture modeling identified heterogeneous trajectories of depressive symptoms before and after major life stressors, including stable low symptoms (ie, resilience), as well as improving, emergent, and preexisting/chronic symptom patterns. Twenty-one PGSs were examined as factors distinctively associated with these heterogeneous trajectories. Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations were applied to examine PGSs associated with each trajectory. Data were analyzed using the DNN model from June to July 2020.Development of depression and resilience were examined in older adults after a major life stressor, such as bereavement, divorce, and job loss, or major health events, such as myocardial infarction and cancer.Discriminatory accuracy of a deep neural net model trained for the multinomial classification of 4 distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale) based on 21 PGSs using supervised machine learning.Of the 2071 participants, 1329 were women (64.2%); mean (SD) age was 55.96 (8.52) years. Of these, 1638 (79.1%) were classified as resilient, 160 (7.75) in recovery (improving), 159 (7.7%) with emerging depression, and 114 (5.5%) with preexisting/chronic depression symptoms. Deep neural nets distinguished these 4 trajectories with high discriminatory accuracy (multiclass micro-average area under the curve, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87-0.89; multiclass macro-average area under the curve, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.85-0.87). Discriminatory accuracy was highest for preexisting/chronic depression (AUC 0.93), followed by emerging depression (AUC 0.88), recovery (AUC 0.87), resilience (AUC 0.75).The results of the longitudinal cohort study suggest that multivariate PGS profiles provide information to accurately distinguish between heterogeneous stress-related risk and resilience phenotypes.",0.758635222

A total of 1573 adolescent survivors of the 8-magnitude Wenchuan earthquake were assessed through the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (cutoff for probable clinical depression: 15), Social Support Rate Scale, Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist, and a self-designed questionnaire covering earthquake exposure and demographic information at 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 30-months after the earthquake. Data were analyzed using growth mixture modeling (GMM) and multinomial logistic regression. The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms were 27.6%, 40.6%, 30.9%, 37.5% and 29.8% at 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 30-months, respectively. GMM analysis showed four patterns of growth curves for depressive symptoms: chronic depression (25.6% of the sample), recovery (1.7%), delayed depression (4.3%), and resilience (68.4%). Female gender was related with decreased probability of resilience. Direct witness of tragic scenes during the earthquake was related with higher risk for chronic depression. More negative life events and fewer social support were also common predictors of not developing the resilience pattern.

This study aimed to (1) estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, at six time points, among mothers over the first 10 years after their child was diagnosed with epilepsy; (2) identify trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms over time; and (3) identify baseline factors associated with each trajectory.Data came from the Health-Related Quality of Life in Children with Epilepsy Study (HERQULES), a Canada-wide prospective cohort study. Data on child, parent, and family characteristics were collected at the time of diagnosis, and follow-ups at 0.5, 1, 2, 8, and 10 years. Maternal depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Trajectories of depressive symptoms were evaluated using latent class growth modeling, and multinomial logistic regression was used to identify baseline factors associated with each trajectory.A total of 356 mothers participated in the study, of whom 57% scored in the at-risk range for major depression disorder (period-prevalence). Four unique trajectories were identified as follows: ""Low-Stable"" (29% of mothers), ""Intermediate-Stable"" (46%), ""High-Stable"" (20%), and ""High-Decreasing"" (5%). Positive family environment was consistently associated with a better trajectory of depressive symptoms over time; other significant factors included type of seizures, child cognitive comorbidity, maternal age, and maternal education.A substantial proportion of mothers of children with epilepsy are at risk for depression, and this risk is stable over the long term. Family environment at the time of diagnosis has long-term and persistent effects and may be an ideal target for interventions.",0.758533219

However, comprehensive understanding of common post-ED symptom trajectories is lacking.The aim of this study was to identify common trajectories of symptom severity in the 6 months after an ED visit for potential ACS.This was a secondary analysis of data from a larger observational, prospective study conducted in five U.S. EDs. Patients (N = 1005) who had electrocardiogram and biomarker testing ordered, and were identified by the triage nurse as potentially having ACS, were enrolled. Symptom severity was assessed in the hospital after initial stabilization and by telephone at 30 days and 6 months using the validated 13-item ACS Symptom Checklist. Growth mixture modeling was used for the secondary analysis. The eight most commonly reported symptoms (chest discomfort, chest pain, chest pressure, light-headedness, shortness of breath, shoulder pain, unusual fatigue, and upper back pain) were modeled across the three study time points. Models with increasing numbers of classes were compared, and final model selection was based on a combination of interpretability, theoretical justification, and statistical fit indices.The sample was 62.6% male with a mean age of 60.2 years (SD = 14.17 years), and 57.1% ruled out for ACS. Between two and four distinct trajectory classes were identified for each symptom. The seven different types of trajectories identified across the eight symptoms were labeled ""tapering off,"" ""mild/persistent,"" ""moderate/persistent,"" ""moderate/worsening,"" ""moderate/improving,"" ""late onset, ""and ""severe/improving."" Trajectories differed on age, gender, and diagnosis.Research on the individual nature of symptom trajectories can contribute to patient-centered, rather than disease-centered, care.

This research is limited in that longitudinal data can be difficult to collect. The aim of the current study was to examine self-reported trajectories in military veterans using an online survey. Consistent with longitudinal work, those who reported chronic distress reported higher symptoms of PTSD and Depression, higher negative affect, lower social support, and less satisfaction with life than those on a resilient trajectory. Two change trajectories demonstrated intermediate scores on relevant measures. These results provide support for a retrospective method to assess trajectories of posttrauma functioning.",0.757837119
https://openalex.org/W2967757409,10.1101/19002519,Childhood Trauma and Trajectories of Depressive Symptoms Across Adolescence,"Abstract Background Growth curve modelling such as trajectory analysis is useful for examining the longitudinal nature of depressive symptoms, their antecedents and later consequences. However, issues in interpretation associated with this methodology could hinder the translation from results to policy changes and interventions. The aim of this article is to provide a “model interpretation framework” for highlighting growth curve results in a more interpretable manner. Here we demonstrate the association between childhood trauma and trajectories of depressive symptoms. Childhood trauma has been shown to a be strong predictor for later depression, but less is known how childhood trauma has an effect throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Identifying when childhood trauma (and its severity) is likely to have its greatest impact on depression is important for determining the timing of interventions for depression. Methods We used data on over 6,500 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to estimate trajectories of depressive symptoms between the ages of 11 and 24. Depressive symptoms were measured using the short mood and feelings questionnaire (SMFQ) across 9 occasions. Childhood trauma was assessed between the ages of 5 and 10 years old, and we estimated population averaged multilevel growth curves of depressive symptoms for exposure to trauma (yes vs no) and then in a separate model, the number of trauma types reported such as inter-personal violence or neglect (coded as 0, 1, 2, 3+). We then calculated what the depressive symptoms scores would be ages 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, between these varying trajectories. Results Reported exposure to childhood trauma was associated with less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence, mainly characterised by exposed individuals having worse depressive symptoms at age 16. There was an exposure-response relationship between the number of childhood traumas and trajectories of depressive symptoms. Individuals exposed to 3 or more types of trauma had substantially steeper and less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms: becoming worse at a more rapid rate until the age of 18. By age 18, individuals that reported the greatest exposure to trauma (3+ types of trauma) had 14% more depressive symptoms compared to non-exposed participants. Limitations This study was subject to attrition, particularly towards the latter ages of the SMFQ. Conclusion Childhood trauma is strongly associated with less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence. Individuals exposed to multiple types of inter-personal violence or neglect are at the greatest risk of worsening depressive symptoms throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Individuals exposed to traumatic experiences in childhood should be identified as at high risk of depression and other adverse outcomes as early trauma may disrupt social development and have lasting consequences on mental health outcomes. The model interpretation framework presented here may be more interpretable for researchers, clinicians and policy makers as it allows comparisons of depression across multiple stages of development to highlight when the effects of depression are greatest.",0.757710429

We examined for predictors and compared the data-driven categories of patients with a priori operational definitions of treatment response.Secondary data analysis using growth mixture modelling (GMM). Missing data were imputed. Trajectories of self-reported depressive symptoms were plotted using scores taken at six nominal time points over 86 weeks from randomisation in all 465 patients.A piecewise GMM categorised patients into two classes with initially similar and subsequently distinct trajectories. Both groups had a significant decline in depressive symptoms over the first 18 weeks. Eighty-four per cent (84.1%, n = 391) of patients were classed as 'continued-improvers' with symptoms reducing over the duration of the study. A further class of 15.9% (n = 74) of patients were termed 'halted-improvers' with higher baseline depression scores, faster early recovery but no further improvement after 18 weeks. Presence of baseline comorbidity somewhat increased membership to the halted-improvers class (OR = 1.40, CI: 1.00-1.96). By end of study, compared with classes, a clinical remission cut-off score (≤27) and a symptom reduction score (≥50%) indexing treatment response misclassified 15% and 31% of cases, respectively.A fast reduction in depressive symptoms in the first few weeks of treatment may not indicate a good prognosis. Halted improvement is only seen after 18 weeks of treatment. Longitudinal modelling may improve the precision of revealing differential responses to treatment. Improvement in depressive symptoms may be somewhat better in the year after treatment than previously considered.",0.757438011

A representative epidemiological sample of 2825 youth aged 10–11 years from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth were followed until 24–25 years of age. Presence of chronic illness was measured using self-report and symptoms of depression were assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Multilevel modeling was used to investigate trajectories of depressive symptoms, adjusting for family environment and sociodemographic characteristics during the transition to young adulthood. Trajectories showed cubic change over time – increasing from early to mid-adolescence, decreasing to early young adulthood, increasing again to late young adulthood. Youth with chronic illness (n=753) had significantly less favorable trajectories and significantly higher proportions of clinically relevant depressive symptoms over time compared to their peers without chronic illness (n=2072). This study is limited by selective attrition, self-reported chronic illness and no assessment of illness severity, and mediating effects of family environment factors could not be examined. Findings support the diathesis-stress model; chronic illness negatively influenced depressive symptoms trajectories, such that youth with chronic illness had higher depression scores and less favorable trajectories over time. The health and school system are uniquely positioned to support youth with chronic illness navigate this developmental period in an effort to prevent declines in mental health.",0.756854494

Latent class analyses (LCAs) in refugees have identified subgroups that differ in symptom profiles of PTSD and comorbid symptoms. However, knowledge on longitudinal symptom profiles in refugees is sparse. Examining longitudinal PTSD and depression symptom profiles could provide information on risk factors underlying worsening of symptoms post-resettlement. Self-rated PTSD (Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) symptoms were assessed among 613 refugees who had resettled in Australia up to two years previously (W1) and at 6 months follow-up (W2). PTSD and depression symptom profiles were identified using LCAs for W1 and W2 separately. Latent transition analysis was used to examine (predictors of) changes in symptom profiles, including gender, age, trauma exposure, and PMLDs. Four classes were identified that were consistent across timepoints: a No symptoms (W1 61%; W2 68%), Low PTSD/Moderate depression (W1 16%; W2 10%), Moderate PTSD/depression (W1 16%; W2 14%), and High symptoms class (W1 7%; W2 7%). Higher levels of problems with PMLDs, including being discrimination and family separation, predicted movements out of the No symptom class at W1 to classes with psychopathology at W2. To conclude, most participants did not develop PTSD or depression symptoms. The risk of developing these symptoms seems higher when problems with interpersonal PMLDs increased, pointing to the need for considering these stressors when addressing the mental health needs in this population.",0.753734263

Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Short Form at four time points (age 28-35, age 30-37, age 40, and age 50). Labor force status was measured monthly starting at age 30 until age 58-62. Depressive symptom trajectories were estimated using growth mixture modeling and multistate modeling estimated WLE from age 30-60 for each gender and depressive symptom trajectory.Five latent symptom trajectories were established: a persistent low symptom trajectory (n = 6838), an episodic trajectory with high symptoms occurring before age 40 (n = 995), an episodic trajectory with high symptoms occurring around age 40 (n = 526), a trajectory with high symptoms occurring around age 50 (n = 570), and a persistent high symptom trajectory (n = 277). The WLE for men at age 30 was 30.3 years for the persistent low symptom trajectory, 22.8 years for the episodic before 40 trajectory, 19.6 years for the episodic around age 40 trajectory, 18.6 years for the episodic around age 50 trajectory, and 13.2 years for the persistent high symptom trajectory. Results were similar for women. WLE disparities between depression trajectories grew when stratified by race/ethnicity and education level.Roughly a quarter of individuals experienced episodic depressive symptoms. However, despite periods of low depressive symptoms, individuals were expected to be employed ~5-17 years less at age 30 compared to those with low symptoms.

Furthermore, it was examined whether maladaptive personality traits and relations with parents were predictive of following one of these trajectories. Three latent classes emerged from growth mixture modelling with a symptom inventory ( n = 911): a Stable High, a Strong Decreasing and a Moderate Decreasing trajectory. Subsequently, by using multinomial logistic regression analyses in a subsample of late‐adolescents ( n = 127), it was revealed that high levels of Negative Affectivity and Detachment were predictive of following the Strong Decreasing, and high levels of Detachment were predictive of following the Stable High trajectory. Support from or Negative Interactions with parents were not predictive of any of the trajectories. The current results contribute to the notion of individual trajectories of change in symptom distress and provide suggestions for screening patients on personality traits to gain insight in the course of this change. © 2018 The Authors Personality and Mental Health Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd",0.752130411

This study examined trajectories of PTG among adolescents following the Wenchuan earthquake, analyzing the relationships between PTG trajectories and gender, age, traumatic exposure, and posttraumatic stress disorder.Adolescents were surveyed 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 years after the earthquake. Self-report questionnaires were administered to 391 participants ranging in age from 12 to 19 years.Four PTG trajectories were found: high, decreasing, low-stable, and increasing. High PTG group respondents were older and had more intrusive symptoms. In addition, having more symptoms in the hyperarousal symptom cluster was associated with the development of high PTG. In contrast, the presence of fewer symptoms in the avoidance symptom cluster increased the likelihood of high or increasing PTG.These findings indicated that adolescents exhibit heterogeneous PTG trajectories and that age and posttraumatic stress disorder symptom clusters differentiate distinct PTG trajectories.",0.751651425

Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify latent classes of PTSD symptoms. Additionally, gender, age, racial or ethnic minority status, depression severity, anxiety severity, quality of life, perceived need for services, and disaster exposure were examined to explore class differences.LCA supported a 3-class model with low (n = 407, 61.9%), moderate (n = 191, 29.0%), and high PTSD symptoms (n = 60, 9.1%). Women appeared most at-risk for a moderate-severity presentation as compared to a low-severity presentation. Further, racial or ethnic minority groups appeared most at-risk for a high-severity presentation as compared to a moderate-severity presentation. Overall, the high symptom class had the poorest well-being, the most perceived need for services, and the highest exposure to the disaster, followed by the moderate symptom class, and finally the low symptom class.PTSD symptom classes appeared to be differentiated primarily by overall severity as well as important psychological, contextual, and demographic dimensions.",0.751476077

The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal cross-lagged relationships between mindfulness, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and posttraumatic growth among adolescent survivors of the 2016 Jiangsu tornado in China. Data was collected at two secondary schools located in Yancheng city, where the severe catastrophic damage occurred during the tornado. The sample included 247 adolescent survivors (59.5% girls) aged 12–14 years who were directly affected by the tornado. Participants self-reported their trait mindfulness, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and posttraumatic growth at two time points: 6-month (T1) and 9-month post-tornado (T2; attrition rate 17.4%). Cross-lagged structural equation modelling analyses were conducted. Results showed that posttraumatic stress symptoms at T1 significantly predicted reduced trait mindfulness at T2 but not posttraumatic growth; trait mindfulness at T1 did not significantly predict posttraumatic stress symptoms nor posttraumatic growth at T2; and posttraumatic growth at T1 did not predict trait mindfulness nor posttraumatic stress symptoms at T2. These findings suggested that posttraumatic stress symptoms may negatively influence the development of trait mindfulness in disaster-affected adolescents in China, and that posttraumatic growth may have unique implications for this young population which was not associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms or trait mindfulness.",0.751000907

Aim of the present 7-wave study was to assess the predictive values using a representative sample of adult Dutch (N=4052) participating in three health-surveys in November-December 2009 (T1), 2010 (T2), 2011 (T3). In total, 2988 out of 4052 also participated in trauma-surveys in April(T4), August(T5) and December(T6) 2012 and a fourth health-survey in November-December 2012 (T7). About 10% (N=314) was confronted with potentially traumatic events (PTE) in the 4 months before T4 or T5. Latent class analyses among 4052 respondents identified four classes of pre-event MHP and HRD. Series of multivariate logistic regression analyses with class membership, peri-traumatic stress, type of event, gender, age and education as predictors, showed that classes with high levels of MHP or HRD, were more at risk for high levels of PTSS at baseline and follow-ups at 4 and 8 months, than classes with low levels of MHP or HRD. These classes were very strong predictors for high levels of post-event MHP and HRD: no differences were found between non-affected and affected respondents with different levels of peri-traumatic stress.",0.750992416

Four trajectory classes were identified: Low-Stable, Mid-Increasing, Borderline-Stable, and Chronic-High. Relations of the identified trajectories with parental incarceration, parent–child relationships, trauma, and parenting as well as future substance use and criminality were then examined. Children of incarcerated parents were underrepresented in the Low-Stable trajectory and overrepresented in the Mid-Increasing group. However, nearly 60% of the children of incarcerated parents were best represented by the low-risk trajectory. The trajectory classes differed significantly on many of the preadolescent measures, such as parent–child relationships and trauma, as well as on adolescent delinquency, adult criminality, and substance use. The Mid-Increasing, Borderline-Stable, and Chronic-High trajectory groups showed significantly higher levels of early risk factors and problematic outcomes than the Low-Stable trajectory group.

While some studies document that the majority of individuals exposed to single event terrorism report low levels of psychological distress, more research is needed to understand different adaptation profiles following this type of trauma, and the factors that might predict responses. &#x0D; Methods: We examined post-trauma responses in 257 first responders/medical professionals (66.8 percent) and civilians (33.2 percent) exposed to the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings. Data for post-trauma profiles—post-traumatic growth (PTG), posttraumatic stress, and emotion regulation—and profile predictors—trauma proximity, trauma history, and coping flexibility—were collected approximately 2.5 years after the bombings. Latent profile analysis identified response profiles, and multinomial logistic regression identified demographic, event-specific, and psychological predictors of profile membership. &#x0D; Results: Four profiles emerged: (1) symptomatic, (2) resistant, (3) resilient, and (4) struggling growth. First responder role decreased the odds of belonging to the struggling growth profile, as compared to the symptomatic profile. Greater coping flexibility and adaptive emotion regulation increased the odds of membership in the struggling growth, rather than symptomatic profile.&#x0D; Conclusion: A subset of individuals experiencing post-traumatic stress symptoms years after trauma exposure may also be utilizing flexible, adaptive coping strategies and experiencing PTG. First responders may have difficulty experiencing simultaneous distress and growth, and interventions designed to promote healthy post-trauma adaptation for this population could be tailored accordingly.",0.750605805

This longitudinal study aims to examine joint trajectories of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in a sample of Italian adults during the pandemic, and to identify psychosocial predictors of distress states. We analyzed four-wave panel data from 3,931 adults who had received assessments of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms between April 2020 and May 2021. Trajectories of individual psychological distress were identified by Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) with parallel processes, and multinomial regression models were conducted to identify baseline predictors. Parallel process LCGA identified three joint trajectory classes for depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Most individuals (54%) showed a resilient trajectory. However, two subgroups showed vulnerable joint trajectories for depression, anxiety and stress. Expressive suppression, intolerance to uncertainty, and fear of COVID-19 were risk characteristics associated with vulnerable trajectories for mental health distress. Moreover, vulnerability to mental health distress was higher in females, younger age groups and those unemployed during the first lockdown. Findings support the fact that group heterogeneity could be detected in the trajectories of mental health distress during the pandemic and it may help to identify subgroups at risk of worsening states.",0.750390723

Eligible participants were screened for depressive symptoms by home visitors using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at least three times across four time periods from the first trimester of pregnancy to six months postpartum. Growth Mixture Modeling was applied to identify distinct trajectory classes, and multinomial logistic regressions were performed to analyze predictors of class membership.Mean depressive symptom scores in this racially/ethnically diverse sample of low-income women decreased significantly over time from a high of 8.1 at time1 to a low of 6.8 at time4. Four classes were identified, including a low-stable group (78.2% of sample), a high-stable group (10.6%) along with decreasing (7.1%) and increasing (4.1%) trajectories. Women with a history of abuse and mental health difficulties were more likely to be classified in the high-stable and decreasing depression groups than the low-stable group. Low social support was linked to an increasing trajectory that resulted in high levels of postpartum depression.Although most women exhibited stable and positive trajectories, more than one out of five presented with either persistently or intermittently high depression scores. Taken together, the findings underscore the importance of depression screening throughout the perinatal period and identifying factors that may be used to target resources to at-risk populations.",0.750281794

Methods We use a combination of latent class mixed modeling and time-to-event analysis to develop and test a measure of resilience that is outcome-based, sensitive to specific shocks and stressors, and captures the enduring effects of how frequently and severely children face the risk of acute malnutrition. Results Harnessing a high-resolution longitudinal dataset with anthropometric information on 5,597 Kenyan households for the 2016–20 period, we identify resilience trajectories for 141 wards across Kenya. These trajectories—characterized by variation in the duration and severity of episodes of acute malnutrition—are associated with differential risk: (1) some 57% of wards exhibit an increasing trajectory—high household risk despite growing resilience; (2) 39% exhibit chronic characteristics—showing no real signs of recovery after an episode of crisis; (3) 3% exhibit robust characteristics—low variability with low-levels of individual household risk; whereas (4) 1% show a steady decrease in resilience—associated with high levels household risk. Discussion Our findings highlight the importance of measuring resilience at the ward-level in order to better understand variation in the nutritional status of rural households.",0.750042875

The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between pre-arrival expectations and the course of psychological symptoms across time. A secondary analysis of 1,496 principal visa applicants across five waves of the Building a New Life in Australia (BNLA) study was conducted. The cross-sectional associations between expectations on the one hand, and post-traumatic stress (PTSD-8) symptoms and psychological distress (Kessler-6; K6) on the other, were assessed using multiple regression. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to identify discrete symptom trajectories of psychological symptoms across five years following settlement, and multinomial regressions were used to determine if violated expectations predicted membership of identified PTSD-8 and K6 class trajectories. LCGA supported a four-class solution for the PTSD-8 ""Resilient Post Traumatic Stress (PTS)"" (54.1%), ""Improving PTS"" (15.0%), ""Deteriorating PTS"" (17.3%), and ""Persistently High PTS"" (13.6%). For the K6, three classes were identified: ""Persistently Mild K6"" (60.4%), ""Resilient K6"" (9.4%), and ""Persistently High K6"" (30.2%). Thwarted expectations were found to significantly predict membership of less favourable symptom trajectories classes in the context of other established predictors. Post-settlement expectations may thus have weak but unique predictive value for the course of psychological symptoms alongside other factors such as older age and financial stress. Implications of these findings for service provision and policy are discussed.",0.750007815

This study aimed to identify different trajectories of depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older adults and study the risk of death across these trajectories.In the population-based Rotterdam Study, depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale) at three examination rounds (1993-2004) from 3,325 dementia-free participants (mean age 64.6 ± 6.1 years) were used to identify depression trajectories by latent-class trajectory modeling. Mortality rates by trajectory were calculated over a subsequent 13 year period (2002-2015), that is using 23 years of follow-up data.Five trajectories of depressive symptoms characterized by low (73.4%), decreasing (11.1%), remitting (5.1%), increasing (7.7%), and high (2.7%) depressive symptoms were identified. Compared with persons in the low symptoms trajectory, persons with a trajectory of increasing depressive symptoms (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.21 [95% CI = 1.02, 1.44]) had a higher risk of death, but not those with remitting depressive symptoms, HR: 1.06 (95% CI = 0.85, 1.32). The estimates for the high symptoms trajectory were also suggestive of a higher risk of mortality, HR: 1.20 (95% CI = 0.91, 1.58).Repeated measures of depression can help predict long-term health outcomes in persons with depressive symptoms. Participants with increasing symptoms over time had a higher risk of death than those with low or no depressive symptoms. Transient high depressive symptoms that remitted were not associated with a higher risk compared with those with no symptoms.

Few studies, however, have examined the heterogeneity of general psychopathology (GPP) trajectories considering symptoms of anxiety, depression, and hostility in adolescence simultaneously. Identifying antecedents for distinct trajectory groups of GPP, and their respective consequences, may provide insight into the etiological underpinnings of social antecedents of different symptoms and inform the targets and timing of intervention.European American target adolescents (N=444, 53% female) evaluated three domain specific symptoms (i.e., symptoms of anxiety, depression, and hostility) as well as psychosocial risks and social consequences over 10 years (from 1990 [Wave 2] to 2001 [Wave 13]). First- and second-order growth mixture models (SOGMMs) were used to identify trajectories of GPP and specific symptoms from mid-adolescence through young adulthood, as well as their predictors and consequences.A three-class model consisting of high and escalating (10.1%), high and decreasing (23.2%), and consistently low (66.7%) GPP emerged as the preferred solution. More predictors and outcomes were associated with membership in both the high and escalating and the high and declining classes of GPP compared to corresponding classes of the specific symptoms trajectories.Self-reported information regarding three symptoms may be a source of bias within the current study.Our findings suggest that unified interventions and/or prevention efforts are needed to not only assess specific symptoms, but also to treat GPP in adolescence.",0.749730874

Method In this prospective longitudinal study, we followed 232 children, including 148 exposed to repeated wartime trauma and 84 controls, at three time points: early childhood (1.5–5 years), middle childhood (5–8 years), and late childhood (9–11 years). Children were diagnosed at each time point and four trajectories defined: children exhibiting no pathology at any time point, those displaying early pathology that later remitted, those showing initial resilience followed by late pathology, and children presenting chronic pathology across the entire first decade. Maternal behavioral containment during trauma evocation and child social engagement during free play were observed in early childhood and maternal emotional distress self‐reported across time. Results War‐exposed children showed significantly higher rates of psychopathology, with 81% exhibiting pathology at some point during childhood. In middle childhood, exposed children displayed more posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD), anxiety disorders, and attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), and in late childhood more PTSD , conduct/oppositional defiant disorders, and ADHD. War‐exposed children had more comorbid psychopathologies and number of comorbidities increased with age. Notably, war‐exposure increased prevalence of chronic pathology by 24‐fold. Maternal factors, including mother's uncontained style and emotional distress, increased risk for early and chronic psychopathology, whereas reduced child social engagement augmented risk for late pathology. Conclusions Early‐onset chronic stress does not heal naturally, and its effects appear to exacerbate over time, with trauma‐exposed children presenting a more comorbid, chronic, and externalizing profile as they grow older. Our findings demonstrate that responses to trauma are dynamic and variable and pinpoint age‐specific effects of maternal and child factors on risk and resilience trajectories. Results highlight the importance of conducting long‐term follow‐up studies and constructing individually tailored early interventions following trauma exposure.",0.749197413

Psychological stress is a common complaint; however, little is known about its patterns in perioperative patients. This study aimed to identify distinct trajectories of perioperative stress and explore antecedent factors and hospitalization outcomes among different trajectories in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.A longitudinal study was conducted on 203 patients with gastrointestinal surgical cancer at a specialized oncology hospital in China. Psychological stress was assessed at five perioperative time points (1-3 days before surgery; 1-3 days, 4-6 days, 7-9 days after surgery, and before discharge). A growth mixture model was used to analyze the potential stress trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify the characteristics associated with different trajectories.Three stress trajectories were identified: recovery class (RC, 60.6%), chronic class (CC, 29.5%), and deterioration class (DC, 9.9%). Compared with CC, RC exhibited a shorter length of stay and better recovery quality, and was related to employment, low illness perception, and positive coping; DC reported lower recovery quality from 7 to 9 days after surgery to discharge and was associated with poor education level, history of surgery, stoma, smoking, and preoperative insomnia.Most surgical patients were insulated from stress due to psychosocial resources, and thus displayed good recovery. However, many patients had moderate stress that did not improve or worsen over the perioperative period, which still needs to be screened and provided with early stress management.",0.749032735

We identified courses of depressive symptoms in an epidemiological sample of emerging adults. Methods. We used latent class growth modeling to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms measured by the 12-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) during a 14-year follow-up of 2825 Canadian youths aged 10 to 25 years enrolled in the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth between 1994 and 2009. Results. After adjustment for youth, parent, and family factors, the 3 distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms were minimal (55%; CES-D &lt; 6), subclinical (39%; CES-D = 9–13), and clinical (6%; CES-D &gt; 18). All trajectories exhibited a parallel course, with peak symptoms at 15 to 17 years of age. Subclinical and clinical symptoms were more common than minimal symptoms in female youths and in respondents with lower self-concept, lower socioeconomic status, poorer interpersonal relations, and chronic health conditions (P &lt; .01). Conclusions. Among emerging adults, trajectories of depressive symptoms do not trend upward or downward, and variables associated with identified trajectories demonstrated dose–response effects that agreed with vulnerability–stress theories of depression.",0.748223947

It is a major contributor to adverse birth outcomes. Previous studies linking antepartum depression to birthweight have yielded conflicting results, which may be the reason that the depressive symptoms were only measured once during pregnancy. This study aimed to explore the associations between trajectories of antepartum depressive symptoms and birthweight. Methods Depressive symptoms were assessed prospectively at each trimester in 3699 pregnant women from 24 hospitals across 15 provinces in China, using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). Higher scores of EPDS indicated higher levels of depressive symptoms. Associations between trajectories of depressive symptoms and birthweight were examined using group‐based trajectory modeling (GBTM), propensity score‐based inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and logistic regression. Results GBTM identified five trajectories. Compared with the low‐stable trajectory of depressive symptoms, only high‐stable (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.15–2.52) and moderate‐rising (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.12–1.85) had an increased risk of low birthweight (LBW) in the adjusted longitudinal analysis of IPTW. There was no significant increase in the risk of LBW in moderate‐stable and high‐falling trajectories. However, trajectories of depressive symptoms were not associated with the risk of macrosomia. Conclusion Antepartum depressive symptoms were not constant. Trajectories of depressive symptoms were associated with the risk of LBW. It is important to optimize and implement screening, tracking, and intervention protocols for antepartum depression, especially for high‐risk pregnant women, to prevent LBW.",0.746574485

No studies have examined depressive symptom trajectories among individuals with asthma despite increased risk. This study expanded prior literature by identifying the following: (1) depressive symptoms trajectories for individuals with and without asthma and (2) predictors of baseline levels and changes in symptoms across time for individuals with asthma. Methods Adolescents with (N = 965) and without (N = 7,392) asthma self-reported on depressive symptoms (CESD-9) across development. Covariates included: demographics and persistence of asthma. Latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) was used to identify depressive symptom trajectories and their predictors. Results A multigroup LCGM identified no significant differences between depressive symptom trajectories of individuals with and without asthma. Depressive symptoms followed a quadratic shape across time for individuals with asthma (Mintercept = 5.73, p &amp;lt; .00; Mlinear = −0.38,p &amp;lt; .001; Mquad = 0.03, p &amp;lt; .001), with a linear deceleration in depressive symptoms during adolescence and an acceleration of symptoms into adulthood. Next predictors of depressive trajectories among individuals with asthma were examined. Female sex (B = 0.58, p &amp;lt; .001), lower parent education (B = −0.57, p &amp;lt; .001), older age (B = 0.19, p &amp;lt; .001), and identifying as Black (B = 0.31, p = .04) were associated with greater baseline depressive symptoms. Older individuals exhibited faster linear symptom decelerations (B = −0.56, p &amp;lt; .001) and faster symptom accelerations (B = 0.73, p &amp;lt; .001). American Indian (AIAN) individuals exhibited faster linear symptom decelerations (B = −1.98, p = .005) and faster quadratic accelerations (B = 3.33, p = .007). Discussion Our results suggest that the depressive symptom trajectories of individuals with asthma are curvilinear and similar to individuals without asthma. When examining predictors of depressive symptom trajectories for those with asthma, socioeconomic disadvantage and racial marginalization were associated with greater baseline depressive symptoms. Although AIAN youth demonstrated more favorable trajectories in adolescence, they also exhibited worse trajectories across young adulthood and adulthood. Findings suggest the need to better understand the impact of multilevel risk and protective factors on depressive symptoms trajectories for individuals with asthma, especially marginalized populations.",0.746335348

In this study, we examined the trajectories of self-esteem among victims of occupational injury and disease and their relation to health.The Panel Study of Workers' Compensation Insurance conducted annual follow-ups on workers who had experienced occupational injury or disease. A total of 2,000 participants, who had completed medical care, were followed from 2013 to 2017. Growth mixture modeling was utilized to identify latent classes in the self-esteem trajectory. Additionally, logistic regressions were conducted to explore the association between trajectory membership, baseline predictors, and outcomes.Three distinct trajectory classes were identified. Total 65.8% of the samples (n = 1,316) followed an increasing self-esteem trajectory, while 31.1% (n = 623) exhibited a constant trajectory, and 3.1% (n = 61) showed a decreasing trajectory. Individuals with an increasing trajectory were more likely to have a higher educational attainment (odds ratio [OR], 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.88), an absence of a moderate-to-severe disability rating (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.96), no difficulty in daily living activities (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.88), and were economically active (re-employed: OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.52-3.98; returned to original work: OR, 4.46; 9% CI, 2.65-7.50).

Finnish fathers ( N = 773) reported psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire; GHQ-36) and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory; BDI-13) in pregnancy (T1), and at 2 months (T2) and 12 months (T3) postpartum. They further reported their fathering experience (Parenting Stress Index; PSI-36) at T2 and T3. Results revealed five paternal mental health trajectory classes, differing in timing and course of symptoms across the pre- and postpartum: stable low (79%) and moderate increasing (9%) levels of symptoms, and prenatal (5%), early fatherhood (3%) and heterogeneous high levels of (4%) problems. The trajectory classes were associated with fathering experiences within parental, interactive and child domains, across the child’s first year. The stable low levels of symptoms-class showed the most positive experiences and the heterogeneous high levels of problems-class the most negative ones; mental health problems in the early fatherhood-class reported negative fathering experience, but only when the child was 2 months old. A family’s infertility history neither showed any significant association with trajectory classes nor moderated their impact on early fathering, supporting the growing evidence that infertility treatments do not place an additional burden on early fatherhood.",0.745788335

The identification of a class characterized by an increasing trajectory of depression symptoms across the transition to adulthood is a novel finding. Of the risk and protective factors assessed, only initial student status and perceived family support helped prospectively distinguish between trajectory classes—students with higher depression symptomology in late adolescence are at increased risk for depression across the transition to adulthood, while perceived family social support in late adolescence is a protective factor associated with reduced probability of being in more symptomatic depression trajectories. Although limitations related to sample size warrant due caution, the findings still have diagnostic, prevention, and treatment implications related to the prospective differentiation of diverging depression symptom trajectories (i.e., multifinality) in the transition to adulthood.",0.745614754

Internal resources, such as having recourse to a transcendent spiritual framework, may play an important part in creating a meaningful perspective on the work and developing coping strategies to overcome challenging experiences. Aid workers from agencies based in North America and Europe participated in a longitudinal study of stress and mental health between 2005 and 2009 (Lopes Cardozo et al., 2012). Participants completed assessments of spiritual transcendence, trauma exposure, psychiatric distress, and posttraumatic life changes at predeployment (n 212), postdeployment (n 170), and a 3- to 6-month follow-up assessment (n 154). Latent class growth analysis indicated 3 distinct trajectories of spiritual changes across the sample: (1) a group with high spiritual transcendence at predeployment with small, but significant, decreases over time; (2) a group with moderate and stable spiritual transcendence scores; and (3) a group with low and slightly decreasing spiritual transcendence scores over the study period. Participants who reported a religious affiliation were more likely to be in the high spiritual transcendence group, and different trajectories were not associated with likelihood of psychiatric distress at postdeployment or follow-up. However, those reporting higher spiritual transcendence were more likely to report positive life changes following their deployments. Findings suggest that spiritual transcendence was relatively stable in this sample, and that aid workers with greater spiritual transcendence may be more oriented toward personal growth after trauma exposure in their work.",0.745208035

However, longitudinal data on the direction of this association and the stability of perceived social support are scarce and have yielded mixed results, with a particular lack of prospective studies. We aimed to investigate changes in perceived social support and bidirectional associations between perceived social support and psychological symptoms in a prospective, longitudinal study. Methods A sample of German soldiers was assessed before and after deployment to Afghanistan. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to investigate the stability of perceived social support and to identify possible distinguishable trajectories of perceived social support. Bidirectional associations between perceived social support (general and workplace) and psychological symptoms (depressive, anxiety and PTS) were examined using gamma regressions. Results Average levels of perceived general social support did not change, while perceived workplace social support increased slightly (t(344) = 5.51, p &lt; .001). There were no distinguishable trajectories of perceived social support. Higher perceived general (Mean ratio ( MR) = 0.84, 95% CI = [0.74, 0.95]) and workplace social support ( MR = 0.82, 95% CI = [0.72, 0.92]) predicted lower depressive symptoms, but not anxiety or PTS symptoms. Only higher PTS ( MR = 0.95, 95% CI = [0.91, 0.99]) and higher depressive symptoms ( MR = 0.96, 95% CI = [0.93, 0.99]) predicted lower perceived general social support. Conclusions Perceived social support can remain relatively stable under exposure to environmental stressors such as military deployment. Higher perceived social support could protect against depressive symptoms via a stress-buffering mechanism, while support may need to be more tailored to individual needs for a protection against PTS symptoms. Individuals with elevated depressive and PTS symptoms might have impaired abilities or opportunities to access social support after stressful event exposure. Future studies could investigate distressing social emotions and associated maladaptive social cognitions as possible mechanisms in the association between symptoms and lower perceived social support. Especially with respect to PTS symptoms, future studies could focus on conditions that enable individuals to benefit from social support.",0.745162434

We also examined adverse childhood events, occupational class, long-standing illness and health behaviour as determinants of the trajectories. A sample from the Helsinki Health Study was extracted comprising 2350 employees. Baseline characteristics were obtained from mail surveys conducted in 2000–2 and 2007. CMD were measured by the General Health Questionnaire. Participants were followed between the ages of 50–59. Work disability trajectories were modelled by the annual number of work disability months in group-based trajectory analysis. Multinomial regression was used to predict trajectory group memberships. Three trajectories were identified: no work disability (consisting 59% of the all employees), stable/low (31%) and high/increasing disability (10%). Employees with CMD were more likely to belong to the stable/low (odds ratio 1.73 [95% confidence interval 1.37–2.18]), and the high/increasing (2.55 [1.81–3.59]) trajectories. Stratified models showed that the determinants of the trajectories were largely similar for those with CMD compared to those without CMD except that obesity was a somewhat stronger predictor of the high/increasing trajectory among employees with CMD. The focus on midlife public sector employees limits the generalisability to other employment sectors and younger employees. CMD were strongly associated with a trajectory leading to early exit from employment and a stable/low work disability trajectory. These findings have implications for interventions promoting work ability of employees with mental ill-health.",0.745033531

Aim of the study is to examine in the context of a natural disaster the potential effects of resilience on the relation between coping and trauma spectrum symptoms, using structural equation modeling. A sample of 371 students who survived the earthquake in L’Aquila (Italy) were cross-sectionally evaluated using Resilience Scale for Adolescents, Brief Cope and Trauma and Loss Spectrum scale. The model shows a direct path of positive and emotional coping styles on resilience. Emotional coping shows also a direct impact on the outcome; positive and emotional coping results to be positively correlated as well as emotional and disengagement coping styles. Resilience directly affects the PTSD symptoms, partially mediating the impact of the coping styles. The model explains 30% of the variance in the outcome, i.e. the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, with very good fit indexes. Resilience operates as a protective factor from stress symptom development. It is likely that emotional and disengagement coping skills are rapidly involved after a traumatic exposure but when problem focused coping intervenes, resilience allows it to buffer the stressors or even guides toward a more successful outcome.",0.74439604

Using latent class mixed models (LCMM), a data-driven analytic that identifies groups of patients with similar trajectories, we identified distinct 6 month functional recovery trajectories in a large cohort (n = 1046) of adults 18–70 years of age with complicated mild to severe TBI who participated in the Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment Trial (COBRIT). We used multinomial logistic fixed effect models and backward elimination, forward selection, and forward stepwise selection with several stopping rules to explore baseline predictors of functional recovery trajectory. Based on statistical and clinical considerations, the seven-class model was deemed superior. Visualization of these seven functional recovery trajectories revealed that each trajectory class started at one of three recovery levels at 1 month, which, for ease of reference we labeled groups A–C: Group A, good recovery (two classes; A1 and A2); Group B, moderate disability (two classes; B1 and B2); and Group C, severe disability (three classes; C1, C2, and C3). By 6 months, these three groups experienced dramatically divergent trajectories. Group A experienced stable good recovery (A1, n = 115) or dramatic decline (A2, n = 4); Group B experienced rapid complete recovery (B1, n = 71) or gradual recovery (B2, n = 742); Group C experienced dramatic rapid recovery (C1, n = 12), no recovery (C2, n = 91), or death (C3, n = 11). Trajectory class membership was not predicted by citicoline treatment (p = 0.57). The models identified demographic, pre-injury, and injury-related predictors of functional recovery trajectory, including: age, race, education, pre-injury employment, pre-injury diabetes, pre-injury psychiatric disorder, site, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, post-traumatic amnesia, TBI mechanism, major extracranial injury, hemoglobin, and acute computed tomographic (CT) findings. GCS was the most consistently selected predictor across all models. All models also selected at least one demographic or pre-injury medical predictor.

Comparing Canada and the United States,"<h3>Objective</h3> This study examines how trajectories of depressive symptoms from the age of 16–25 are related to early adult education and employment outcomes in Canada and the United States. <h3>Methods</h3> Data came from the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (n=2348) and the American National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Child/Young Adult Survey (n=3961). Depressive symptom trajectories from the age of 16–25 were identified separately for each country using growth-mixture modeling, and linked to respondents’ education and employment status (working with a post-secondary degree; working with no degree; working with a high school degree; in school; and, not in employment, education, or training i.e., NEET), and part/full-time employment (less than 30 hours/week, 30–40 hours/week, more than 40 hours/week). We assessed the association of depressive symptom trajectories with these outcomes using multivariable multinomial logistic regressions, calculating the adjusted predicted probability of each outcome using marginal standardization. <h3>Results</h3> In both countries four similar depressive symptom trajectories were identified: low-stable, increasing, decreasing, and first increasing then decreasing symptoms (i.e., mid-peak). In both countries, increasing, decreasing, and mid-peak trajectories were associated with higher odds of working with low educational credentials, and/or NEET relative to low-stable trajectories. In Canada, however, all trajectories had a higher predicted probability of either being in school or working with a post-secondary degree than the other outcomes; in the USA, all trajectory groups were most likely to be working with a high school degree. In the USA but not in Canada, increasing and decreasing trajectories were associated with higher odds of part-time work than full-time work. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Higher levels of depressive symptoms during the transition to adulthood are associated with working with no or low credentials, NEET, and working part-time in young adulthood. Country-level differences may modify the influence of depressive symptoms.",0.742748973

  into Baseline Effect and Temporal Effect","Longitudinal processes are often associated with each other over time; therefore, it is important to investigate the associations among developmental processes and understand their joint development. The latent growth curve model (LGCM) with a time-varying covariate (TVC) provides a method to estimate the TVC's effect on a longitudinal outcome while simultaneously modeling the outcome's change. However, it does not allow the TVC to predict variations in the random growth coefficients. We propose decomposing the TVC's effect into initial trait and temporal states using three methods to address this limitation. In each method, the baseline of the TVC is viewed as an initial trait, and the corresponding effects are obtained by regressing random intercepts and slopes on the baseline value. Temporal states are characterized as (1) interval-specific slopes, (2) interval-specific changes, or (3) changes from the baseline at each measurement occasion, depending on the method. We demonstrate our methods through simulations and real-world data analyses, assuming a linear-linear functional form for the longitudinal outcome. The results demonstrate that LGCMs with a decomposed TVC can provide unbiased and precise estimates with target confidence intervals. We also provide OpenMx and Mplus 8 code for these methods with commonly used linear and nonlinear functions.",0.742738071

However, positive psychological changes (i.e., postevent growth) should also be taken into account. The aim of this cross-national study was to investigate both postevent distress and growth in firefighters following distressing incidents. A sample of 1,916 firefighters from 8 predominantly European countries recalled a work-related distressing incident. Two hierarchical regression analyses were run to reveal predictors of postevent distress and growth, respectively. Predictors included person pre-event characteristics, objective (e.g., type of incident, time since incident, fatalities) and subjective (e.g., perceived life-threat, peri-event distress, most distressing aspect) incident features, and the participant's country. Postevent distress was measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and growth by the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory-Short Form (PTGI-SF).

To examine the longitudinal patterns and predictors of depression trajectories before, during, and after Hong Kong’s 2014 Occupy Central/Umbrella Movement. Methods. In a prospective study, between March 2009 and November 2015, we interviewed 1170 adults randomly sampled from the population-representative FAMILY Cohort.

We identified 4 trajectories: resistant (22.6% of sample), resilient (37.0%), mild depressive symptoms (32.5%), and persistent moderate depression (8.0%). Baseline predictors that appeared to protect against persistent moderate depression included higher household income (odds ratio [OR] = 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06, 0.56), greater psychological resilience (OR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.48, 0.82), more family harmony (OR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.56, 0.83), higher family support (OR = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.92), better self-rated health (OR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.16, 0.49), and fewer depressive symptoms (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.43, 0.81).

We investigated which RTW trajectories can be identified among employees with MHPs in terms of RTW duration and relapse occurrence during the RTW process. Additionally, we examined how different RTW trajectories can be described in terms of personal and work characteristics. Methods Longitudinal sickness absence registry data were collected retrospectively from the largest Dutch occupational health service. Quantitative RTW information as well as personal and work characteristics were extracted. In total, 9517 employees with a sickness absence due to MHPs were included in the analyses (62 938 data points; RTW durations from 29 to 730 days). Results A latent class transition analysis revealed five distinct RTW trajectories, namely (1) fast RTW with little chance of relapse, (2) slow RTW with little chance of relapse, (3) fast RTW with considerable chance of relapse, (4) slow RTW with considerable chance of relapse and (5) very fast RTW with very small chance of relapse. Differences between employees in the slower and faster trajectories were observed regarding gender, age, type of MHP, organisation sector and organisation size but not regarding part-time work. Conclusions RTW trajectories among employees with MHPs showed large individual variability and differed on personal and work characteristics.

Substantial evidence supports a link between neighborhood conditions and externalizing behaviors. However, the timing of neighborhood effects on the developmental course of externalizing behaviors and the role of family and peer processes in shaping neighborhood effects remains unclear. The current study aims to examine the relationship between perceived neighborhood quality and trajectories of child externalizing behaviors in a U.S. nationally representative cohort, focusing on the timing of neighborhood effects and the role of family and peer processes in mediating these effects. The study included 3563 children who participated in three consecutive waves of Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in 1997, 2002 and 2007. In a latent growth curve model (LGCM), we estimated trajectories of externalizing behaviors and the effects of perceived neighborhood quality on the trajectories, using parental, family and peer processes as potential mediators. At baseline, better neighborhood quality was moderately associated with fewer externalizing behaviors among seven-to twelve-year-olds, but was not associated with externalizing behaviors among children six years and younger. During follow-up, better neighborhood quality was associated with small decreases in externalizing behaviors, primarily mediated by lower levels of parental distress and family conflict. This study suggests that better perceived neighborhood quality contributes to fewer externalizing behaviors throughout childhood and adolescence, and that parental distress and family conflict are the main mediators of these effects. Given the pervasiveness of exposure to adverse neighborhood conditions, efforts to reduce concentrated poverty and improve neighborhood environments may improve children and adolescents’ mental health at the population level.",0.741573676

However, little is known about the trajectories of wealth in later life, and how the life course socioeconomic status (SES) may contribute to the development of wealth at old-age. This study investigated longitudinal patterns of wealth trajectory and whether SES across the life course affects these trajectories using critical period, accumulation, and social mobility models. Using data from 16,189 adults aged 51 and older from the 2004-2014 Health and Retirement Study, a growth mixture model was used to explore distinct wealth trajectories. Impacts of life course models were studied using multinomial logistic regression. Results showed that four heterogeneous latent classes of wealth were identified: Stable high (reference group), Low and increasing, Stable low, and High but decline. Disadvantaged adulthood SES, accumulated exposure to socioeconomic risks, and downward or persistent socioeconomic disadvantage over the life course were associated with Stable low, Low and increasing, and High but decline, supporting all three life course mechanisms on wealth development in later life. Evidence suggests that wealth development is heterogeneous across individuals, and a strong gradient effect of life-course SES on wealth trajectories are clearly observed. Programs and policies should address the effects of life course on wealth development to strengthen the economic well-being in later life.",0.741238982

There is a paucity of research examining longitudinal course of negative symptoms across the initial years of treatment for first-episode psychosis using individual-based trajectory analysis. No study has been conducted investigating differential relationships of early-stage negative symptom trajectories with long-term distal outcomes. This study examined patterns and baseline predictors of negative symptom trajectories over the first 3 years of treatment in 138 patients aged 18–55 years presenting with first-episode nonaffective psychosis, using latent class growth analysis based on symptom ratings measured at 4 different time points (baseline, 1, 2, and 3 years). We further explored prospective relationships of identified trajectory classes with functional and negative symptom outcomes at 13-year follow-up. Our results revealed 3 distinct negative symptom trajectories including minimal-stable (59.6%), mild-stable (29.4%), and high-increasing (11.0%) trajectories. Poorer premorbid adjustment, more severe global cognitive impairment, and depressive symptoms at baseline were found to predict high-increasing trajectory. Among 3 trajectory classes, patients in high-increasing trajectory had the worst functional and negative symptom outcomes at 13-year follow-up, with post hoc analyses demonstrating significant outcome differences between high-increasing and minimal-stable trajectories. Our findings thus affirm a heterogeneous course of negative symptoms in first-episode psychosis and indicate that early-stage negative symptom trajectories are critically associated with long-term outcomes. Patients displaying persistently high negative symptom levels in the initial 3 years of treatment may represent a specific subgroup who necessitates an extended period of early intervention specifically targeting at negative symptoms to promote early functional recovery.",0.740929081

This has also been referred to as “traumatic grief”. Knowledge on the course of traumatic grief among disaster-bereaved people could enhance our understanding of aetiology and treatment of traumatic grief. In a Dutch four-wave longitudinal study, we conducted two studies, examining the course of traumatic grief symptoms among people (N = 172) whose significant other died due to a plane disaster with flight MH17 that took place in 2014. People completed PCBD, PTSD, and depression questionnaires 11, 22, 31, and 42 months after the disaster. To identify (predictors of) trajectories of PCBD, PTSD, and depression in disaster-bereaved people (study 1) and to examine temporal associations between these symptoms (study 2) latent class growth modelling and cross-lagged analyses were used, respectively. In study 3, people (N = 39) with elevated traumatic grief levels were included in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the effects of cognitive plus EMDR therapy (vs. waitlist controls) on PCBD, PTSD, and depression symptoms. Participants completed questionnaires before and after treatment or waiting period. Multi-level modelling was used for data-analysis. In study 1, a Mild (81.8%) and Chronic (18.2%) PCBD class emerged. For PTSD and depression we found a Mild (85.2% and 85.6%), Recovered (4.4% and 8.2%), and Chronic trajectory (10.3% and 6.2%). A lower educational level predicted chronic trajectories. In study 2, changes in PCBD symptoms had a greater impact on changes in PTSD and depression symptoms than vice versa. In study 3, preliminary RCT findings showed that PCBD, PTSD, and depression symptom-levels significantly declined for both groups with a significantly stronger decline in depression for the treatment condition. To conclude, in study 1 we found support for differential trajectories across the outcomes, suggesting that different symptom-profiles post-loss may need different treatment approaches. Study 2’s findings run counter to the notion that PTSD and depression symptoms should be addressed before grief in treatment. Based on study 3, we suggest that cognitive therapy plus EMDR might be useful for treating people with traumatic grief, but there is room for improvement.",0.740488832

This study investigated risk and protective factors associated with four trajectories of posttraumatic distress (resilience; in-recovery; delayed-onset; chronic) in the affected community. A sample comprising 709 adults participated in two survey rounds, conducted in 2016-2017 and 2019-2020. Participants’ exposure to mine fire-related particulate matter (PM2.5) during the event, sociodemographic circumstances, physical and mental health histories, prior trauma, and exposure to recent stressful events were assessed. Mine fire-related posttraumatic distress was measured using the Impact of Events Scale – Revised and trajectories determined by categorising scores at each survey according to a threshold prescribed for identifying symptoms warranting clinical concern. Responses were analysed with univariate and multivariate multinomial regressions. Socioeconomic advantage and social support were associated with the resilient trajectory, which was the most common posttraumatic distress trajectory among participants. Prior trauma and recent stressful life-events, physical and mental health diagnoses, and loneliness were associated with chronic and delayed-onset trajectories. PM2.5 exposure during the mine fire was not a strong determinant of posttraumatic distress trajectory. Socioeconomic status, social connection, health and life experiences are among the most important factors shaping posttraumatic distress trajectories. These findings contribute to better understanding longer-term psychological resilience and vulnerability following disasters and can inform mental health initiatives within at-risk communities.",0.740325772

The sample was 2549 Swedish tourists who survived the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and responded to postal surveys at 1, 3 and 6 years after the tsunami, including assessment of personality traits, PTS and general distress. The sample was categorized into a direct exposure group and an indirect exposure comparison group. For both PTS and general distress, individuals with a resilient trajectory were lower in the trait neuroticism than those in the symptomatic trajectories whereas there were no differences in personality traits between the resilient trajectory and the low exposure comparison group. Neuroticism was strongly related to trajectories of both PTS and general distress even when adjusting for important risk factors such as traumatic bereavement and exposure severity. Other personality traits demonstrated weak associations with the trajectories. The present findings correspond with the notion of neuroticism as a vulnerability factor for symptomatic long-term trajectories of posttraumatic and general distress whereas resiliency was not predicated by particularly low levels of neuroticism.",0.740263093

To address this issue, this study examined distinct latent trajectories of academic burnout in adolescents following the Wenchuan earthquake, China. Adolescents were surveyed at 1 (T1), 1.5 (T2), 2 (T3), and 2.5 years (T4) after the earthquake. Self-reported questionnaires were administered to 391 participants aged 12- to 19-years-old. The results identified three academic burnout trajectories: Increasing (3.9%), low (85.4%), and decreasing (10.7%). Additionally, intrusive post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were more likely in the increasing group, avoidance PTSD symptoms were more likely in the decreasing group, and PTSD hyperarousal symptoms were more likely in the decreasing group, but less likely in the increasing group. These findings indicate that adolescents experienced heterogeneous academic burnout changes following the earthquake.",0.739919564
https://openalex.org/W2560018261,,Modeling trajectories of mental health: challenges and opportunities.,"More than two thirds of mental health problems have their onset during childhood or adolescence. Identifying children at risk for mental illness later in life and predicting the type of illness is not easy. We set out to develop a platform to define subtypes of childhood social-emotional development using longitudinal, multifactorial trait-based measures. Subtypes discovered through this study could ultimately advance psychiatric knowledge of the early behavioural signs of mental illness. To this extent we have examined two types of models: latent class mixture models and GP-based models. Our findings indicate that while GP models come close in accuracy of predicting future trajectories, LCMMs predict the trajectories as well in a fraction of the time. Unfortunately, neither of the models are currently accurate enough to lead to immediate clinical impact. The available data related to the development of childhood mental health is often sparse with only a few time points measured and require novel methods with improved efficiency and accuracy.",0.739292714

This study extends evidence of heterogeneous change in postnatal MDS by examining their cross‐contextual antecedents in infancy and their consequences for children's early behavior problems and language skills in late toddlerhood. A community sample of mother–child dyads ( N = 235, 72% Caucasian) was assessed when children were 7, 15, and 33 months old. Mothers reported their socioeconomic status (SES), social support, marital relationship quality, family dysfunction, parenting stress, and infants’ functional regulatory problems at 7 months postpartum, and children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 33 months. Children completed a receptive vocabulary assessment at 33 months in the lab. Latent class growth analysis identified three postnatal MDS trajectory classes that fit the data best: low‐decreasing, moderate, and increasing. Psychosocial measures at seven months postpartum primarily predicted membership to these postnatal trajectory classes, which subsequently differed in children's internalizing, externalizing, and receptive vocabulary in late toddlerhood, controlling for family SES and functional regulatory problems in infancy. We discuss salient antecedents and consequences of postnatal depression for mothers and their offspring.",0.739205012
https://openalex.org/W3196623043,,Mental health trajectories during the Covid-19 Lockdown: evidence for resilience and the role of psychological resources and flexibility,"The implementation of lockdowns and the Covid-19 pandemic situation have negatively impacted mental health (anxiety, depression). However, little is known about individual differences in the longitudinal reactions to lockdown. We designed a longitudinal study (a) to identify the various trajectories of symptoms of depression and anxiety in the general population under and out of lockdown; (b) to determine which positive psychological resources prevent individuals from falling into groups with the most severe trajectories; (c) to test the mediating role of psychological flexibility. We collected data on a heterogeneous sample of French participants (N = 1144) during the end of the first lockdown (from 17 March to 11 May 2020). Participants were asked to report their psychological resources, psychological flexibility and symptoms of anxiety and depression weekly for five weeks. Growth mixture modelling enabled identifying dynamic profiles of symptoms: four for depression, three for anxiety. Resilience emerged as the most frequent trajectory. Wisdom, optimism, hope, and peaceful disengagement significantly prevented adherence to the symptomatic groups. Moreover, psychological flexibility emerged as a significant mediator of these effects. This study highlights the importance of cultivating protective factors and psychological flexibility to prevent mental health damage during potentially traumatic events (PTE) and favour resilience trajectories.",0.739193884

We explored physical and mental QoL trajectories during the first six months after stroke and determined the associations between trajectories and long-term prognosis in patients with first-ever ischemic stroke. Included were 733 participants from a prospective study. QoL was assessed with the 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12) at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Patients' prognoses (stroke recurrence and death) were identified from 2010 to 2021. The latent class growth model (LCGM) was used to identify distinct trajectories of physical and mental QoL measured over the first 6 months. We employed the Cox model or Fine-Gray model for prognoses to examine the associations between QoL trajectories and prognosis. Five trajectories of physical QoL and five trajectories of mental QoL were identified. For physical QoL of the Poor-Improved, and Moderate-Impaired trajectory versus Moderate-Improved trajectory, the hazard ratio (HR) for death was 2.39 (1.14 to 5.02), and 2.03(0.93 to 4.44); the HR for recurrence was 1.56 (0.83 to 2.94) and 2.33 (1.28 to 4.24). For mental QoL of the Moderate-Impaired trajectory versus the Moderate-Improved trajectory, the HR for death was 2.48 (1.21 to 5.07). The results were robust in the sensitivity analysis. QoL during the first six months after ischemic stroke can be categorized into distinct groups. Change in QoL was associated with long-term survival. Secondary prevention of recurrent strokes might rely more on improving patients' physical QoL.",0.73893223

The purpose of this study was to characterize recovery trajectory subtypes that exist after non-neurologic injury.A prospective, observational cohort of 500 adults with an Injury Severity Score > 10 but without traumatic brain or spinal cord injury from 2009 to 2011 was formed. The Short Form-36 was administered at admission and repeated at 1, 2, 4, and 12 mo after injury. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to determine the number and shape of physical composite score (PCS) and mental composite score (MCS) trajectories.Three PCS trajectories and five MCS trajectories were identified. For PCS, trajectory 1 (10.4%) has low baseline scores, followed by no improvement over time. Trajectory 2 (65.6%) declines 1 mo after injury then improves over time. Trajectory 3 (24.1%) has a sharp decline followed by rapid recovery. For MCS, trajectory 1 (9.4%) is low at baseline and remains low. Trajectory 2 (14.4%) has a large decrease after injury and does not recover over the next 12 mo. Trajectory 3 (22.7%) has an initial decrease in MCS early, followed by continuous recovery. Trajectory 4 (19.1%) has a steady decline over the study period. Trajectory 5 (34.3%) stays consistently high at all time points.Recovery after injury is complex and results in multiple recovery trajectories. This has implications for patient-centered clinical trial design and in development of patient-specific interventions to improve outcomes.",0.738906642

Methods: The Health and Retirement Study (2006–2014) and linked Veteran Mail Survey were used to estimate latent growth curve models of depressive symptom trajectories, beginning at respondents’ first report of resilience. Results: Veterans with higher levels of resilience do not have increased depressive symptoms in later life, despite previous exposure to DDW. Those with lower levels of resilience and previous exposure to DDW experience poorer mental health in later life. Discussion: Psychological resilience is important for later-life mental health, particularly for veterans who endured potentially traumatic experiences.

Methods A total of 120 patients newly diagnosed with LC were recruited in this longitudinal prospective study. Our survey investigated patients’ symptoms in 6 months. Latent growth curve analysis (LGCA) was conducted to identify patients with distinct trajectories of symptom and fatigue distress. The characteristics of the patients among groups were compared for statistical differences by the chi-square test or ANOVA. Results The results of LGCA revealed that the linear three-trajectory model had the best model fit for symptom and fatigue distress. Patients’ symptom and fatigue distress improved with time, except for patients with increasing trajectories. Patients’ trajectories of symptom and fatigue distress were affected by pain, lower functional status, total symptom score and depression. Moreover, patients with increasing trajectories of symptom and fatigue distress experienced more pain, physiological symptoms and depression from 1 to 6 months. Conclusions Pain and functional status were the major factors that deteriorated the recovery of trajectory in symptom distress and fatigue distress among patients with increasing trajectories.",0.738710699

Methods Trajectories are estimated using LCGA, which considers all individuals within a trajectory to be homogeneous. The methodology was applied to a subsample of the Spanish WORKing life Social Security (WORKss) cohort, limited to persons born 1956–1965 (N=247 475). The number of days worked per year is used as a repeated measure across 32 time points (1981–2013). Results According to the model-fit results and further guided by expert knowledge, a four WTL model was selected as the optimal approach: WLT1 or “high labor force participation” (N=99 591; 40.2%); WLT2 or “decreased labor force participation” (N= 22 846; 9.2%); WLT3 or “increased labor force participation” (N=59 213; 23.9%); and WLT4 or “low labor force participation” (N=65 827; 26.6%). WLT1 consisted mainly of men with more years of work experience (&gt;19 years) while WLT4 was mainly composed by women with &lt;9 years. The other two trajectories had opposite trends and no sex differences. The occupational category variable had little influence in the trajectories. Conclusions Longitudinal data that are regularly collected by administrative systems can benefit from LCGA approaches to identify different trajectory patterns that may be associated with an outcome of interest. In occupational epidemiology, this study represents a step forward by using this modeling approach to identify different WLT.",0.738546468

Objective: The goal of this study was to describe unique trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms in HF patients over 12 months and determine whether changes in these symptoms predict subsequent physical health-related quality of life (P-HRQOL) and event-free survival. Method: The study sample consisted of 597 patients with HF enrolled as part of a larger longitudinal study at 8 sites from across the United States. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Brief Symptom Inventory Anxiety subscale, and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire Physical Subscale were used to assess depression, anxiety, and P-HRQOL, respectively. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify distinct trajectories of change in depression and anxiety. Results: Three trajectories of depression and three trajectories of anxiety were identified (entropy = 0.919). Trajectory changes in depressive symptoms were labeled as getting better (81.1%), bad and getting slightly worse (13.9%), and bad and getting much worse (5.0%). Trajectory changes in anxiety were labeled as getting better (66.7%), stable with slight improvement (22.1%), and getting much worse (11.2%). The trajectories of depression labeled as bad and getting slightly worse and bad and getting much worse were predictive of a poorer P-HRQOL at one-year than the trajectory which showed improvement (β 11.6, p&lt;0.001 and β 15.6, p&lt;0.001, respectively). Changes in depressive symptoms labeled as bad and getting slightly worse was also a significant predictor of event-free survival (HR = 2.17, p&lt;0.001). The two anxiety trajectories which showed stable, slight improvement and much worse anxiety symptoms over 12-months were significant predictors of worse P-HRQOL (β 12.0, p&lt;0.001 and β 18.7, p&lt;0.001, respectively). The trajectory of anxiety symptoms labeled getting much worse was a significant predictor of event-free survival (HR = 2.18, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: We identified three distinct trajectories for both depression and anxiety symptoms, some of which were predictive of P-HRQOL and event-free survival at one year.",0.738149184

Birthweight, gestational age, birth length, and head circumference were examined in linear models, and low birthweight (<2500 g) and preterm birth (<37 weeks) in logistic models, with adjustment for confounders.Associations were found between experiencing damage during Katrina and birthweight (adjusted beta for high exposure = -158 g) and between injury and gestational age (adjusted beta = -0.5 days). Of the indicators of recovery experience, most consistently associated with worsened birth outcomes was worry that another hurricane would hit the region (adjusted beta for birthweight: -112 g, p = 0.08; gestational age: -3.2 days, p = 0.02; birth length: -0.65 cm, p = 0.06).Natural disaster may have long-term effects on pregnancy outcomes.

Assessment was conducted at 3, 6, and 15 months after the disaster. Bivariate latent change score modeling was conducted to examine the nature of the time-sequential associations between symptoms of PTSD and MDD RESULTS: Results revealed a unidirectional coupling effect from depression to change in PTSD, but unidirectional coupling effect from PTSD to change in depression was not supported.Only linear relations of within-individual change and time-sequential associations between PTSD and depression were examined, and therefore, it precludes potential nonlinear relations between these constructs. Also, the results of the current study are limited to the studied timespan (i.e., 3 to 15 months). Lastly, other factors that could be confounding the change in PTSD symptoms were not examined, leaving a possibility of other constructs that may influence the change in future PTSD symptoms CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that disaster survivors with higher symptoms of depression may be at higher risk of experiencing increased PTSD symptoms even after one year, raising an importance of tailoring a treatment to alleviate depressive symptoms and to mitigate the risk of future symptoms of PTSD.",0.73751883

https://openalex.org/W2895328366,,Predictors of Risk and Resilience in Emotion Regulation: The Effects of Person and Context in Three High-Risk Samples,"Author(s): Norona, Amanda Nicol | Advisor(s): Baker, Bruce L | Abstract: We examined emotion regulation (ER) processes in three high-risk samples, with two primary aims: (1) to examine the effects of concentric levels of influence on ER, from within the individual (i.e., genotype, temperament), to aspects of the proximal environment (i.e., parenting behaviors), and to broader contextual factors (e.g., income, family composition); and (2) to determine whether various levels of influence affect developmental trajectories of ER, in addition to initial levels. We advanced these aims in samples of children with and without developmental delay, low-income children enrolled in Early Head Start, and children adopted from foster care. In Study 1, we used latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) to model yearly change in emotion dysregulation from child age 3 to 6 years and to test predictors of initial levels of and change in dysregulation. Dysregulation was found to decrease overall across early childhood, and serotonin transporter genotype X parenting interactions predicted individual differences in growth curves. Dysregulation trajectories of children with the SL/LL genotype were minimally related to positive and negative parenting behavior, whereas dysregulation decreased more precipitously among children with the SS genotype when exposed to low negative parenting or high positive parenting.In Study 2, latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to identify trajectory groups of ER across toddlerhood and examine predictors of those trajectory groups from child temperament, parenting behaviors, and environmental risk. LCGA supported a three-class model, with a Stable-High ER group, a Low-to-High group, and a High-to-Low group. The Stable-High group was characterized by high positive parenting, the Low-to-High group by high child negative emotionality, and the High-to-Low group by high negative parenting and high environmental risk. Lastly, membership in these trajectory groups was found to be predictive of resilient functioning in the 5th grade.In Study 3, we examined factors that predict ER among children adopted from foster care, at the time of the adoptive placement and then 5 years post-placement. Among child temperament, pre/perinatal risk, and pre-placement environmental risk, reactive temperament emerged as the sole predictor of ER at the time of adoptive placement. When looking at ER after 5 years of adoptive placement, aspects of the adoptive family environment predicted changes in ER, though the nature of the changes depended on the temperament of the child. Results from the three studies were discussed in terms of theoretical and practical implications.",0.737323433

The aims were 1) to identify trajectories of depression and work limitations over 2-year follow-up and 2) to determine factors associated with trajectory group membership from demographic, work and health characteristics. <h3>Methods</h3> We used data from 632 workers with a musculoskeletal disorder. Data were collected at baseline and at 6,12 and 24 months follow-up. Depressive symptoms were measured with the CES-D. The Work Limitations Questionnaire was used to assess work limitations. We used Latent Growth Modelling to identify parallel trajectory groups of depression and work limitations and the impact of demographic, work and health characteristics on trajectory group membership. <h3>Results</h3> A four-class trajectory was chosen as best fitting and substantively meaningful model. Group 1 (37.7%) represented with the lowest scores for depression and work limitations and both scores decreased over time; group 2 (12.8%) had both very high depression and work limitations scores that almost stayed constant over the 2-year follow-up period; group 3 (15.0%) consisted of workers with medium scores of both depression and work limitations and group 4 (34.0%) had high scores of work limitations, which decreased dramatically (from 80 to 20), and depression that also decreased significantly, but not as but not as much as work limitations. Return-to-work, self-efficacy, mental and physical health scores showed significant differences between some of the groups. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Distinct trajectories of depression and work limitations in injured workers were identified. Return-to-work and health characteristics predicted trajectory group membership. Health care providers should be aware of the course of depression and work limitations over time in injured workers and may monitor both concepts closely after injury.",0.737154432

To date, few longitudinal studies have investigated maternal depressive symptoms from pregnancy to eleven years postpartum. Drawing data from a large population-based study cohort the aims of this study were to 1) identify distinct groups of mothers defined by their trajectories of depressive symptoms spanning from pregnancy to eleven years following the birth of the child, and 2) to identify psychosocial risk factors during pregnancy and in the first few postnatal years that are associated with these trajectories. Data were analyzed from 14,170 mothers who participated in Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to capture maternal depressive symptoms across 10 time points including two prenatal (18 and 32 weeks), and eight postnatal (2, 8, 21, 33, 61, 73, 97 and 134 months) time points. The latent growth model was created to describe the course of maternal depressive symptoms across the preceding time points followed by a latent growth mixture modelling (LGMM) to identify distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms over time within the overall sample. The predictors of maternal depressive symptoms trajectories were categorized into sociodemographic, child, and psychosocial factors. The multinomial regression analyses were conducted to explore associations between the risk factors and depressive symptoms trajectories. LGMM identified four distinct trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms over time: minimal symptoms, increasing symptoms, persistent symptoms, and decreasing symptoms. Predictors of all patterns of depression - persistent, increasing and decreasing symptoms include smoking during pregnancy, and partner conflict. The strongest predictors of the persistent symptom trajectory included maternal history of depression and inadequate social support. The use of self-reported maternal mental health symptoms and under representation of ethnic minorities are our study's limitations.

A sample of 1,278 Chinese adolescents (54.0% girls) with a mean age of 13.4 years (SD = 0.8, range = 12-16) completed 2-wave surveys 2.5 and 3.5 years after a major disaster. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV, the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children, and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders. Latent class analyses identified 4 classes characterized by high, reexperiencing/hypervigilance, dysphoria, and low symptoms, respectively at each time point. Latent transition analyses revealed relatively high levels of temporal stability within low symptom and dysphoria classes but relatively high probabilities of migration from re-experiencing/hypervigilance and high symptom classes into lower symptom classes. Multinomial logistic regression analyses found that some of the between-class movements during the year were predicted by baseline distress or fear disorders. This study provides an initial depiction of both quantitative and qualitative changes in youth's long-term PTSD symptom patterns over time and gives a further elucidation of other forms of posttrauma psychopathology's impacts on PTSD course.

This study evaluates the associations of polygenic risk scores (PRS) with patterns of posttraumatic stress symptoms following combat deployment.US Army soldiers of European ancestry (n = 4900) provided genomic data and ratings of posttraumatic stress symptoms before and after deployment to Afghanistan in 2012. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to model posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories among participants who provided post-deployment data (n = 4353). Multinomial logistic regression models tested independent associations between trajectory membership and PRS for PTSD, major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia, neuroticism, alcohol use disorder, and suicide attempt, controlling for age, sex, ancestry, and exposure to potentially traumatic events, and weighted to account for uncertainty in trajectory classification and missing data.Participants were classified into low-severity (77.2%), increasing-severity (10.5%), decreasing-severity (8.0%), and high-severity (4.3%) posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories. Standardized PTSD-PRS and MDD-PRS were associated with greater odds of membership in the high-severity v. low-severity trajectory [adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, 1.23 (1.06-1.43) and 1.18 (1.02-1.37), respectively] and the increasing-severity v. low-severity trajectory [1.12 (1.01-1.25) and 1.16 (1.04-1.28), respectively]. Additionally, MDD-PRS was associated with greater odds of membership in the decreasing-severity v. low-severity trajectory [1.16 (1.03-1.31)]. No other associations were statistically significant.Higher polygenic risk for PTSD or MDD is associated with more severe posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories following combat deployment. PRS may help stratify at-risk individuals, enabling more precise targeting of treatment and prevention programs.",0.73695633

The current study aimed to identify developmental trajectories of PTSS in childhood and to examine predictors of symptom presentation in 1,178 children from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) studies, a consortium of studies focusing on the causes and effects of child maltreatment. Most children had a history of documented reports with Child Protective Services (CPS) and all were identified as living in high‐risk environments. Using group‐based trajectory modeling, 3 unique developmental trajectories were identified: Resilient, Clinical‐Improving (PTSS in the clinical range at baseline then declining over time), and Borderline‐Stable (chronically subclinical PTSS). Children in the Clinical‐Improving group were more likely than children in the Resilient group to have reports of physical abuse (RRR = 1.76), emotional abuse (RRR = 2.55), neglect (RRR = 1.57), and exposure to violence at home and in the community (RRR = 1.04). Children in the Borderline‐Stable group were more likely than children in the Resilient group to have a CPS history of neglect (RRR = 2.44) and exposure to violence at home and in the community (RRR = 1.04). Many children living in high‐risk environments exhibit resilience to PTSS, but exposure to witnessed violence and neglect appear to put children at chronic risk for poor adjustment. These children may require more intensive, integrated clinical services that attend to multiple adverse experiences.",0.736194356

Past research has investigated negative (e.g., stress) and positive (e.g., growth) following natural disasters, but few studies have explored the complex relationships between factors leading to both types of outcomes. The goal of this study was to examine factors predicting posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) in survivors of Hurricanes Maria and Michael, both of which struck Florida in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Specifically, we investigated how hazard-specific factors, coping strategies, and character strengths were related to PTSS, PTG, or both. An online survey was conducted six to 14 months after the hurricanes among survivors (N ​= ​566). Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted with variables entered systematically. Survivors were more likely to report current PTSS if they (1) experienced more peritraumatic negative emotions, hazard-related stressors, or a past trauma; (2) employed negative coping strategies employed following the storms; and (3) reported low trait optimism or high trait altruism. Current PTG was associated with younger age, length of time following the hazard, more peritraumatic positive emotions and stressors, use of self-distraction and denial for coping, and higher trait optimism. Results indicate that optimism may be protective and beneficial for disaster survivors, but that altruism's role may be more complex than expected. The evidence connecting duration since the storms and PTG and PTSD suggests that the meaning-seeking struggle toward growth takes more time, though time helps healing. The findings provide guidance for subsequent prospective studies designed to improve clinical services and disaster relief.",0.736138671

The cities in Poland and Croatia have been no exemption. In turbulent times, they have been faced with the need to reorient their budgets to remain resilient and solvent. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to investigate the financial resilience profiles of large cities in Poland and Croatia from 2010 to 2020 and to identify the factors differentiating the identified resilience patterns. To obtain empirical results, a two-stage research procedure was employed. In the first stage, group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was applied, while a panel data regression was employed in the second. Our research has revealed different patterns of financial resilience among the cities in Poland and Croatia; moreover, the scope of fiscal resilience of local government units (LGUs) differed over time, which made it possible to distinguish four groups of cities in every country characterized by similar resilience trajectories over time. The common predictors of fiscal resilience in both countries are the percentage of the operating surplus in total income, total income per capita and capital expenditure per capita, although the strength of its impact varies from group to group identified by GBTM. Our research has shown that the source of differences in LGUs’ financial resilience is not as much the nature and intensity of the disturbances experienced as the internal financial capacity.",0.735791879

Though recent years have brought a greater understanding of the consequences of war exposure on mental health outcomes for refugee children, little is known about the longitudinal and developmental impact of these experiences on youth. Aims: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of direct exposure to war and/or combat on trajectories of symptoms related to anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Syrian and Iraqi refugee youth following resettlement. Prevalence of possible anxiety disorders and PTSD was also assessed. Method: Participants included accompanied refugee youth resettled in the state of Michigan in the U.S. ( n = 74). Youth filled out self-report measures of trauma exposure, anxiety symptoms, and PTSD symptoms upon arrival and 2 years later. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to assess the effect of war exposure over time. Results: Upon arrival, 38% screened positive for an anxiety disorder and 4.1% met diagnostic thresholds for PTSD. While war exposure did not predict changes to PTSD symptom trajectories ( p = .481), anxiety symptoms increased over time among children reporting war exposure ( B = 10.13, SE = 4.22, t = 2.40, p = .019). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that without appropriate interventions, anxiety- and trauma-related symptoms often do not decrease. Further, exposure to war trauma may lead to progressive worsening of symptoms. These findings suggest that assessing for type of trauma exposure, rather than focusing solely on migration status, may inform focused attention and interventions among trauma-exposed children resettling as refugees.",0.735332302

This study aimed to analyze the risk factors of PTSD among the 2004 Indian tsunami survivors in Aceh and North Sumatra province, Indonesia. It mapped the trajectory recovery pattern of mental illness and examined the medium-term PTSD consequence five and 18 months after the disaster using a large longitudinal survey. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to derive the association between the post-traumatic stress disorder trajectory group and risk factors. The results showed that 15% and 20% of the respondents had persistent medium-term and delayed-onset PTSD, respectively. The vital predictors of persistent PTSD included being female, aged 50 and older, married, and having higher direct trauma exposures to the tsunami. Furthermore, delayed-onset PTSD was associated with negative life events after the tsunami and perceived less social support. The results indicate the necessity to understand the predictors for each PTSD trajectory group's effective intervention regarding mental health after the disaster.",0.73503223

Further, examining predictors of PTSD pathology provides a better conceptualization of the temporal course of PTSD in trauma victims.The present study examined PTSD symptom severity in individuals presenting to the emergency department (ED) following a traumatic event. Participants (N = 147) were assessed at four timepoints: 2-weeks, 3-months, between 6 and 9 months, and 12-months after ED admission. Growth curve modeling was conducted to examine changes in PTSD symptom severity over time. Age, sex, state anxiety, trait anxiety, emotion dysregulation, depression, and trauma type (motor vehicle accident [MVA] and assault), and PTSD diagnosis were included as covariates in the model.Results demonstrated that baseline PTSD symptom severity was positively associated with severity of depression and state (but not trait) anxiety, emotion dysregulation, and PTSD diagnosis. Results also revealed significant associations with PTSD symptom changes over time; greater state anxiety and depression symptoms at baseline were associated with steeper declines in PTSD symptoms over time.Data were collected at only four timepoints over the course of 12-months.

Methods Secondary data were analysed from a prospective study with four-time measures: before treatment (T1), during treatment (T2), treatment completion (T3) and 10 weeks after treatment (T4). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, group-based trajectory model and generalised estimation equation. Results Fifty nine of 61 participants completed three-time measure (mean age = 60.43 years, male-predominant). The changes in symptom severity over time were divided into two subgroups: slight-stable group (n = 54, 89%) and mild-fickle group (n = 7, 11%). Pain, tiredness and sleeping trouble were the predominant symptoms. The quality of life change in the slight-stable group was significantly better than that of the mild-fickle group (B = 13.35, SE = 3.53, p < 0.001). The overall quality of life at T2, T3 and T4 was better than it was at T1. Conclusion The different trajectories of symptom severity significantly influenced quality of life changes in lymphoma survivors. Healthcare providers must be aware that there is a group of lymphoma survivors with relatively severe symptoms when newly diagnosed, compared to the opposite. More attention must be paid to this group, in addition to providing in-time symptom management.",0.734421039

Parents reported the children's HRQOL and data on potential predictors at each wave (5 in total) as part of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children.Growth mixture modeling identified 5 distinct trajectories of HRQOL during childhood. Eighty-five percent of children had consistently high levels of HRQOL from age 4-5 years to 12-13 years (healthy); 8% of children had a significant and continuous decrease in HRQOL over time (high risk); and a further 5.3% of children had decreases in HRQOL from age 4-5 years to 8-9 years, followed by increases through to 12-13 years (rebound). Finally, a small percentage (1.6%) of children had extremely low levels of HRQOL at age 4-5 years that increased over time (recovery). Maternal smoking, lower household income, living in a non-English speaking household, and nonparticipation in organized sports were predictive of poorer HRQOL trajectories when compared with children in the healthy trajectory.There are distinct trajectories of HRQOL during childhood. Most children (85%) have a healthy, stable pattern, but the remaining children have trajectories indicative of poor HRQOL. Participation in sports, maternal smoking, lower family income, and language spoken at home distinguish among these trajectories. Of these, participation in organized sports has received relatively little attention as a preventative health priority.",0.733270115

Given the demonstrated efficacy of exercise for depression treatment, we examined if exercise buffers against the risk of developing psychiatric symptoms following life stressors. 1405 participants (61% female) from a longitudinal panel cohort experienced disability onset (43%), bereavement (26%), heart attack (20%), divorce (11%), and job loss (3%). They reported time spent exercising and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale) across three time points collected in two-year intervals: T0 (pre-stressor), T1 (acutely post-stressor), and T2 (post-stressor). Participants were classified in previously identified heterogeneous depression trajectories pre- to post-life stressor: resilient (69%), emerging (11.5%), chronic (10%), and improving (9.5%). Multinomial logistic regression found that more T0 exercise predicted likelihood of classification in resilient versus other groups (all p<.02). Controlling for covariates, only the higher likelihood of classification in resilient versus improving remained (p=.03). Follow-up repeated measures general linear model (GLM) assessed whether trajectory was associated with exercise at each time, controlling for covariates. GLM indicated significant within-subjects effects for time (p=.016, partial η2=.003) and time*trajectory (p=.020, partial η2=.005) on exercise and significant between-subjects effects of trajectory (p<.001, partial η2=.016) and all covariates. The resilient group showed consistent high exercise levels. The improving group had consistent moderate exercise. The emerging and chronic groups were associated with lower exercise post-stressor. Pre-stressor exercise may buffer against depression and ongoing exercise may be associated with lower depression levels following a major life stressor.",0.733258888

Little is known about the trajectories of these symptoms and subsequent development of chronic conditions. This study examines whether (1) mental health trajectories can predict the onset of chronic conditions in young women and (2) trajectories are stronger predictors of the incidence of these conditions than mental health status measured at single time point.6013 young Australian women were followed every 3-year for 20 years. The mental health trajectories in their 20s and mental health status 3-year before the onset of chronic conditions were used to predict the incidence of six chronic conditions in their 30s. Mental health trajectories were identified using latent mixture modelling of five-item Mental Health Index.Five mental health trajectories were identified: maintaining a high score (high-stable); starting low then steadily increasing (improving); moderately high score, declining, then increasing (declining-improving); starting high then steadily decreasing (declining), and maintaining a low score (low-stable). In their 30s, 1015 (16.9%) women developed one or more conditions. The low-stable and declining groups were associated with increased odds of developing one or more conditions by 45% (odds ratio [OR] 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.94) and 48% (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.10-1.98), respectively, compared with the high-stable group.

Latent growth curve analysis was used to identify distinctive concurrent trajectory classes of DS and CF. Generalized linear mixed models were further used to examine the association between the concurrent trajectories and health outcomes. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to examine the risk of mortality as a function of the concurrent trajectories.1,302 older adults followed-up approximately 9-years were successfully classified into 6 distinct concurrent trajectory classes of DS (low-increasing, high) and CF (high, high-declining, medium-declining). Compared to the co-occurrence of low DS and high CF trajectories, those with the high DS and declining CF trajectories were at greater risk of ADL and IADL functional limitations (1.6 - 2.9 times), more medical visits (1.3 - 1.4 times), hospital admissions (1.6 - 1.9 times), and mortality (1.7 - 2.6 times).Differences in adverse health outcomes across concurrent trajectory classes of DS and CF suggest that differences in underlying co-occurrence and progression have important implications for public health interventions as well as development of aging social and health policies.",0.731847315

Secondly, several conditional growth models were formulated to test the usefulness of covariate variables hypothesized to explain observed variance in growth factors. Finally, latent class models were estimated to explore different latent trajectory classes further.

These symptoms can increase the need for medical care and reduce the quality of their life. However, little is known about symptom experiences specific to adolescents undergoing HSCT. Objective The primary aim was to describe symptom incidence, severity, and distress trajectories among adolescents from pre-HSCT through 90 days post-HSCT. A secondary aim was to examine the relationship between symptom trajectories and demographic and treatment factors. Methods A repeated-measures design was used for this prospective study. Demographic and treatment information was collected from the medical record. Symptoms were assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale 10–18. Symptom trajectories were identified by latent class growth analysis with growth mixture modeling; logistic regression evaluated relationships of demographic and treatment characteristics on the latent classes of symptom trajectories. Results Two distinct latent class trajectories were identified for symptom incidence, severity, and distress. Symptom incidence declined, but symptom severity and distress remained stable. No significant relationships were noted among any demographic or treatment characteristics to any of the symptom trajectories. Conclusions Symptoms persist and remain severe and distressing throughout the first 90 days after HSCT, with pain and lack of energy among the highest in incidence, severity, and distress.

Identifying trajectories of adversity throughout childhood would allow classification of children according to the accumulation, timing, and persistence of adversity, and may provide unique insights into the risk of subsequent depression.Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we created a composite adversity score comprised of 10 prospectively assessed domains (e.g., violent victimization, inter-parental conflict, and financial hardship) for each of eight time points from birth through age 11.5 years. We used semiparametric group-based trajectory modeling to derive childhood adversity trajectories and examined the association between childhood adversity and depression outcomes at the age of 18 years.Among 9,665 participants, five adversity trajectories were identified, representing stable-low levels (46.3%), stable-mild levels (37.1%), decreasing levels (8.9%), increasing levels (5.3%), and stable-high levels of adversity (2.5%) from birth through late childhood. Approximately 8% of the sample met criteria for probable depression at 18 years and the mean depression severity score was 3.20 (standard deviation = 3.95, range 0-21).

Rooted in social cognitive theory and the transactional model of stress and coping, this study longitudinally investigated the reciprocal relations among coping self-efficacy (CSE), coping behaviors (approach and avoidant), and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among highly exposed hurricane survivors. Design: 261 Hurricane Florence survivors completed measures of hurricane-related CSE, coping behaviors, and hurricane-related PTSS across three timepoints, beginning 5–8.5 months after Hurricane Florence. Method: Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models investigated the relations among study variables. Results: Reciprocal, cross-lagged relations were identified between higher CSE and approach coping from T2 to T3. The lagged relations between approach coping at T1 and T2 were significant, as well as between avoidant coping at T2 and T3. Significant cross-sectional relations were also present for CSE, coping behaviors, and PTSS at T3. Conclusions: Results provide partial support for the positive feedback loop involving CSE and approach coping, but not for the negative feedback loop involving avoidant coping. CSE may be an important mechanism in longer-term disaster recovery, in part by increasing use of approach coping.",0.7277724

However, longitudinal investigations into fathers' postpartum depressed mood are limited. This study aimed to identify the typologies of depressed mood trajectories over the first year postpartum among Taiwanese fathers and to examine the factors associated with such typologies. We retrieved data from a nationwide longitudinal study on child development and care in Taiwan. A total of 396 fathers, who completed at least one of the three interviews when their children were 3, 6, and 12 months old between 2016 and 2017, were included in this analysis. Conditional latent class growth analysis was conducted to identify the classifications of the fathers' depressed mood trajectories in the first year postpartum and to estimate the effects of covariates on individuals' membership of a trajectory class. Three classes of depressed mood trajectories were identified. The high increasing group consisted of 11% of the participants; the moderate increasing and the low decreasing groups consisted of 28% and 61% of the participants, respectively. Financial stress was associated with the fathers' likelihood of being in the high increasing group compared with their likelihood of being in the low decreasing group (OR = 2.28, CI = 1.16-4.47). The result may be related to the difference in gender roles and social expectations.",0.727601314

However, previous evidence on its mental health effects has been inconclusive. Whether retirement is desirable or not may depend on pre-retirement work characteristics. We investigated trajectories of depressive symptoms across retirement and how a number of psychosocial working characteristics influenced these trajectories. Methods We included 1735 respondents from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH), retiring during 2008–2016 (mean retirement age 66 years). They had completed biennial questionnaires reporting job demands, decision authority, workplace social support, efforts, rewards, procedural justice and depressive symptoms. We applied group-based trajectory modelling to model trajectories of depressive symptoms across retirement. Multinomial logistic regression analyses estimated the associations between ­psychosocial working characteristics and depressive symptom trajectories. Results We identified five depression trajectories. In four of them, depressive symptoms decreased slightly around retirement. In one, the symptom level was initially high, then decreased markedly across retirement. Perceptions of job demands, job strain, workplace social support, rewards, effort–reward imbalance and procedural justice were associated with the trajectories, while perceptions of decision authority and work efforts were only partly related to the trajectories. Conclusions We observed a rather positive development of depressive symptoms across retirement in a sample of Swedish retirees. For a small group with poor psychosocial working characteristics, symptoms clearly decreased, which may indicate that a relief from poor working characteristics is associated with an improvement for some retirees. However, for other retirees poor working characteristics were associated with persistent symptoms, suggesting a long-term effect of these work stressors.",0.726944258

We investigated if locus of control (LOC) and coping style are associated with long-term PTSD-trajectories after exposure to combat. Six hundred and seventy five Israeli soldiers with or without combat stress reaction (CSR) from the Lebanon war were assessed 1, 2, and 20 years after the war. Combat exposure, LOC, and coping style were then investigated as covariates of the trajectories of resilience, recovery, delayed onset, and chronicity. Symptomatic trajectories in the CSR and the non-CSR group were significantly associated to varying degrees with perceived life threat during combat (ORs: 1.76–2.53), internal LOC (0.77–0.87), emotional coping style (0.28–0.34), and low use of problem-focused coping (2.12–3.11).

Family environment, as indexed by parental expressed emotion, may moderate these trajectories. 388 children with ADHD and 127 controls were assessed using multi-informant, multimethod diagnostic procedures at up to 3 time points 1 year apart in an accelerated longitudinal design spanning ages 7-13 years. Latent-class growth analysis was used to identify developmental trajectories for parent- and teacher-rated ADHD and oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms within the ADHD sample. Parental expressed emotion, criticism, and emotional overinvolvement were coded from a 5-min speech sample at 2 time points, 1 year apart, for 208 of these children and compared among ADHD trajectory groups.Parent-rated hyperactivity yielded a 4-class trajectory solution in latent-class growth analysis; teacher-rated inattention yielded a 3-trajectory solution. Teacher-rated ODD also yielded 3-trajectory solution. A parent-rated high persistent hyperactive group was more likely than the other ADHD groups to have parents with stable high criticism (34.6%, p < .001), with ODD symptoms controlled. A teacher-identified high ODD-worsening group was more likely to experience high criticism, particularly the initial time point; (87.5%, p < .001), with hyperactivity controlled. Parental criticism, an index of the family environment, is uniquely associated with divergent developmental trajectories among children with ADHD in addition to those associated with ODD symptoms. Lay summary: For many children, ADHD symptoms decrease as they transition to adolescence. Family environmental factors, such as parental criticism, may help explain for whom symptom remission is less likely.",0.726697756

This research aims to capture long-term psychological profile of general population following COVID-19 by integrating trajectory modelling approaches, latent trajectory pattern identification and network analyses.Longitudinal data were collected from a nationwide sample of 18 804 adults in 12 months after COVID-19 outbreak in China. Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 and Insomnia Severity Index were used to measure depression, anxiety and insomnia, respectively. The unconditional and conditional latent growth curve models were fitted to investigate trajectories and long-term predictors for psychological symptoms. We employed latent growth mixture model to identify the major psychological symptom trajectory patterns, and ran sparse Gaussian graphical models with graphical lasso to explore the evolution of psychopathological network.At 12 months after COVID-19 outbreak, psychological symptoms generally alleviated, and five psychological symptom trajectories with different demographics were identified: normal stable (63.4%), mild stable (15.3%), mild-increase to decrease (11.7%), mild-decrease to increase (4.0%) and moderate/severe stable (5.5%). The finding indicated that there were still about 5% individuals showing consistently severe distress and approximately 16% following fluctuating psychological trajectories, who should be continuously monitored. For individuals with persistently severe trajectories and those with fluctuating trajectories, central or bridge symptoms in the network were mainly 'motor abnormality' and 'sad mood', respectively. Compared with initial peak and late COVID-19 phase, aftermath of initial peak might be a psychologically vulnerable period with highest network connectivity. The central and bridge symptoms for aftermath of initial peak ('appetite change' and 'trouble of relaxing') were totally different from those at other pandemic phases ('sad mood').This research identified the overall growing trend, long-term predictors, trajectory classes and evolutionary pattern of psychopathological network of psychological symptoms in 12 months after COVID-19 outbreak. It provides a multidimensional long-term psychological profile of the general population after COVID-19 outbreak, and accentuates the essentiality of continuous psychological monitoring, as well as population- and time-specific psychological management after COVID-19.

A sample of 444 sexually abused youth provided data for the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being I. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms and test the effects of parental perpetration and age of abuse onset. Results supported the following three growth trajectories of depressive symptoms in adolescence: falling, rising, and flat. Youth who were sexually abused by a parent were more likely to follow the rising and falling trajectories. Also, youth who experienced sexual abuse at a younger age were more likely to be classified in the falling trajectory.

Participants included 271 Latina mothers of early adolescents living in a new immigrant area in the southeast part of the United States, followed prospectively across four time points spanning 2 years. Mothers reported on their depressive symptoms at all four time points; risk and promotive factors were measured at Time 1 (T1). Latent class growth curve models identified three classes of mothers based on their depressive symptom trajectories. Roughly half of mothers reported low and decreasing symptoms, a third indicated moderate and increasing symptoms, and 10% displayed high and increasing symptoms. As expected, higher levels of stress responses to anti-immigration actions and news, home-school dissonance, and financial strain predicted membership in increasing symptom classes, whereas higher social support predicted membership in the decreasing symptom class. By adapting prevention and intervention efforts to the unique cultural and social contexts experienced by Latina mothers in new immigrant areas, practitioners may be better able to protect this segment of the population from experiencing depressive symptoms.

However, GMM is often applied to data that does not meet the statistical assumptions of the model (e.g., within-class normality) and researchers often do not test additional model constraints (e.g., homogeneity of variance across classes), which can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the number and nature of the trajectories. We evaluate how these methodological assumptions influence trajectory size and identification in the study of resilience to MLS.We use data on changes in subjective well-being and depressive symptoms following spousal loss from the HILDA and HRS.Findings drastically differ when constraining the variances to be homogenous versus heterogeneous across trajectories, with overextraction being more common when constraining the variances to be homogeneous across trajectories. In instances, when the data are non-normally distributed, assuming normally distributed data increases the extraction of latent classes.Our findings showcase that the assumptions typically underlying GMM are not tenable, influencing trajectory size and identification and most importantly, misinforming conceptual models of resilience. The discussion focuses on how GMM can be leveraged to effectively examine trajectories of adaptation following MLS and avenues for future research.",0.725645968

Therefore, the aims of this study were to (i) identify trajectories of mental health problems from childhood to young adulthood and (ii) investigate the association between these trajectories and employment and work outcomes among young adults. Methods Data were used from 360 participants of the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), a Dutch prospective cohort study, with 12-year follow-up. Trajectories of externalizing and internalizing problems were identified with latent class growth models. Employment conditions and work outcomes (ie, psychosocial work characteristics) were measured at age 22. We assessed the association between mental health trajectories and employment conditions and work outcomes. Results Four trajectories of mental health problems were identified: high-stable, decreasing, moderate-stable and low-stable. Young adults with high-stable trajectories of externalizing problems worked over six hours more [B=6.71, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.82-10.6] and had a higher income [odds ratio (OR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.71], than young adults with low-stable trajectories.

Stress and resilience were assessed using questionnaires every 3 months, and diabetes-specific outcomes (self-care, quality of life, and hemoglobin A1C) at 6 and 12 months. Parent and adolescent stress trajectories were identified using semiparametric group-based modeling.Four stress trajectories emerged for parents and three emerged for adolescents. Adolescent trajectories were stable throughout the 12 months, and those with stable low stress had the highest levels of resilience. Further, the stable low stress group had higher quality of life scores at 12-month postdiagnosis. In contrast, stress for parents changed considerably over the 12-month period, and trajectory groups did not associate with 12-month outcomes.Distinct patterns of stress emerged for both the adolescent and parent cohorts. Resilience at the time of diagnosis was particularly protective for adolescents.

Based on the data from the same cohort of college students for four consecutive years, this study used the piecewise growth mixture model to identify the developmental trajectories of general self-efficacy, built a multinomial logistic regression model to analyze the related predictors on different trajectories, and further compared the differences in depression symptoms in general self-efficacy trajectories. Three trajectories of college students' general self-efficacy were identified: stable-rising (8.7%), stable-decreasing (2.4%), and moderate and stable (88.9%). With the moderate and stable class as the reference, gender and extraversion are the predictors of students in the stable-increasing class; gender, extraversion, mother's education level, and university tier significantly predict students who fall into the stable-decreasing class. With the stable-increasing class as the reference, gender also has a significant predictive effect on students who belong to the stable-decreasing class. However, age, ethnicity, siblings, hometown location, father's education level, BMI, sleep, and major were not related predictors. Furthermore, mean differences in depression between latent classes of general self-efficacy trajectories were significant, and the depression scores of the stable-decreasing class were beyond the normal range in the third and fourth years.

With more service members than ever surviving their wounds, prospective research on factors related to long-term, patient-reported outcomes, including self-rated health (SRH), has increased importance. This study's objective was to use preinjury and postinjury SRH measures to identify trajectories and predictors of SRH after combat-related injury. Methods The Wounded Warrior Recovery Project was queried for U.S. military personnel with combat-related injuries from Iraq or Afghanistan between 2004 and 2011. A single-item measure was used to assess SRH once prior to injury and twice after injury, and responses included excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. Only those with good or better preinjury SRH levels were included. SRH trajectories were identified and defined. Multinomial logistic regression examined the association between injury-specific characteristics, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and SRH trajectory. Results The study sample included 1,093 military personnel. Overall, 4 SRH trajectories were identified: (1) 56.7% resilient (preinjury SRH level was maintained throughout follow-up), (2) 9.4% recovered (SRH declined on first postinjury measure then returned to preinjury level), (3) 22.9% delayed (SRH declined only on second postinjury measure), and (4) 11.0% chronic (SRH declined on first postinjury measure and did not return to preinjury level). In multinomial logistic regression and relative to the resilient group, screening PTSD positive, serious-severe injury severity, and lower extremity injury predicted membership in the recovered and chronic groups, whereas back injury predicted membership in the chronic group only. Conclusion This is the first study to examine long-term SRH trajectory following combat-related injury, finding that a majority of military personnel remain at their preinjury health levels of good or better. Decreases in postinjury SRH were associated with physical and psychological factors, which reinforces the need for a multidisciplinary approach to care.",0.72427962

Participants were 469 families examined 4 times when the children were 2 to 54 months of age. Maternal reports of marital conflict, adverse childhood experiences, depressive symptoms, and sociodemographic characteristics were collected, and averaged maternal and paternal reports of child disruptive problems were used. Using growth mixture modeling, 3 trajectories of marital conflict were identified: high increasing (21.8%), high decreasing (7%), and low stable (71.2%). Maternal adverse childhood experiences predicted increased risk of belonging in the high‐increasing group, whereas depressive symptoms predicted increased risk of belonging in the high‐decreasing group. Importantly, children of mothers in the high‐increasing group exhibited higher levels of disruptive behavior at 54 months when compared with children of mothers in the high‐decreasing and low‐stable groups.",0.723980553

While accounting for within-subject correlation, these two approaches ignore heterogeneity in the trajectories of longitudinal outcome. Latent Class Mixed Models (LCMM) takes both into account, which may help identify subpopulation with similar trajectories affected by exposure. In studying the association between PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm) exposure and trajectories of depressive symptoms, we illustrated how exposure effects can be better estimated after accounting for heterogeneity in longitudinal outcome. Methods: A total of 1898 women from Women’s Health Initiative Study of Cognitive Aging (aged 77.3±3.8 years in 1999) without prior depression completed the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) assessments annually between 1999 and 2010. One-year average of daily ambient PM2.5 concentration prior to each GDS assessment was estimated using spatiotemporal models that incorporated U.S. EPA nationwide air monitoring data and output of chemical transport models. Global PM2.5 effects were estimated using GEE, LME and LCMM. We also examined class-specific PM2.5 effects on the identified trajectories of depressive symptoms in multi-class LCMM. Results: Assuming a homogeneous longitudinal trajectory of depressive symptoms, we found no association with PM2.5 using GEE, LME or one-class LCMM. Under the best-fit LCMM, six trajectories were identified, including one with sustained mild symptoms (N=627). Depressive symptoms increased significantly with PM2.5 in this group, but not the others. This class-specific effect was missed in 3- or 4-class LCMM specified a priori. In a separate 6-class LCMM assuming a common exposure effect across classes, we found no association with PM2.5, while global effects were marginally significant and perhaps biased in 3- or 4-class LCMM. Conclusions: When heterogeneity in trajectories of outcome exists, associations can be more appropriately estimated using LCMM, compared to GEE and LME.",0.723749139

Methods Data on 172 stroke survivor–caregiver dyads in Singapore, for whom depressive symptoms were assessed thrice (baseline/3 months/6 months), were utilized. GBTM was applied to delineate depressive symptom trajectories, and to identify their predictors and time-varying covariates. Findings Three stroke survivor depressive symptom trajectories (low and decreasing [47.6%], low and increasing [43.1%], and high and increasing [9.3%]) and 2 caregiver depressive symptom trajectories (low and stable [71.5%] and high and decreasing [28.5%]) were delineated. Caregivers with chronic diseases were more likely (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 8.09[2.04-32.07]) and those caring for older stroke survivors (0.94[0.90-0.98]) were less likely to follow the high and decreasing than the low and stable depressive symptom trajectory. An increase in stroke survivor functional disability and caregiver depressive symptoms led to a rise (~worsening) in stroke survivor depressive symptom trajectories.

This study investigated the sub-trajectory groups of depressive symptoms in women of child-bearing age and the factors impacting latent class membership. Moreover, differences in body mass index (BMI) as an outcome variable were identified among the sub-trajectory groups. Data from the Korea Nurses’ Health Study (KNHS) were analyzed, comprising that from 6,918 participants who filled out surveys during modules 1, 5, and 7. The growth mixture model with individually varying observation times was used to identify latent subgroups of depressive symptom trajectories. Three classes of depressive symptom trajectories were identified: increasing over time, stable/low, and decreasing over time. Older participants had a higher probability of belonging to the stable/low class. Married participants were more likely to belong to the stable/low class than to the increasing over time class or decreasing over time class. Participants who worked shifts had a higher chance of belonging to the decreasing over time class than the stable/low class. There was a significant difference between mean BMI across latent classes in module 1 ( χ 2 ( d f = 2 , N = 6918 ) = 155.16 , p < 0.001 ) and in module 7 ( χ 2 ( d f = 2 , N = 6918 ) = 149.68 , p < 0.001 ). The findings of this study should not be generalized to all women of childbearing age, because the study population only included nurses.

On the basis of longitudinal data on PTSD symptomatology, we tested whether exposure to torture, PTSD or PTSD trajectories accounted for chronic pain and altered pain perception. Participants were 59 torture survivors and 44 age-matched healthy control subjects. Chronic pain was characterized. Pain threshold, pain tolerance, conditioned pain modulation (CPM), and temporal summation of pain were measured. Three PTSD trajectories were identified among torture survivors; chronic, delayed, and resilient. Lack of CPM and more intense chronic pain was found among the chronic and delayed groups compared with the resilient and healthy control groups. Temporal summation of pain was strongest among the chronic group. PTSD trajectories mediated the relationship between torture and CPM. It appears that the duration and severity of posttraumatic distress, rather than the exposure to trauma, are crucial factors that mediate the association between trauma and chronic pain. Because PTSD and its resultant distress are measurable, their evaluation seems particularly important in the management of pain among trauma survivors.

Both methods parametrically model trajectories of individuals, and capture latent trajectory classes, using an expectation–maximization algorithm. However, parametric modeling of trajectories using polynomial functions or monotonic spline functions results in limited flexibility for modeling trajectories; as a result, group membership may not be classified accurately due to model misspecification. In this paper, we propose a smoothing mixture model allowing for smoothing functions of trajectories using a modified algorithm in the M step. Specifically, participants are reassigned to only one group for which the estimated trajectory is the most similar to the observed one; trajectories are fitted using generalized additive mixed models with smoothing functions of time within each of the resulting subsamples. The smoothing mixture model is straightforward to implement using the recently released “ gamm4” package (version 0.2–6) in R 3.5.0. It can incorporate time-varying covariates and be applied to longitudinal data with any exponential family distribution, e.g., normal, Bernoulli, and Poisson. Simulation results show favorable performance of the smoothing mixture model, when compared to latent class growth analysis and growth mixture model, in recovering highly flexible trajectories. The proposed method is illustrated by its application to body mass index data on individuals followed from adolescence to young adulthood and its relationship with incidence of cardiometabolic disease.",0.722470974

There has been little exploration, however, of parent experiences and psychosocial trajectories over time following child critical injury. To address this knowledge gap, a longitudinal qualitative study was conducted to explore parent experiences and support needs and identify parent psychosocial trajectories in the 12 months following child critical injury.Semi- structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 27 parents at three time points over a 12 month period: the immediate hospital period post-child injury, and 6 and 12 months following injury, resulting in a total of 81 interviews. Data were analysed using a longitudinal within and across-case thematic analysis of patterns emerging over time.Three parent trajectory patterns were identified: resilient trajectory where parents were temporarily disrupted by the child's injury and hospitalisation, but recovered their mental and emotional wellbeing quickly, which was maintained over time; recovering trajectory where parents were initially disrupted at the time of injury but their mental and emotional wellbeing fluctuated over time and had not been fully restored by 12 months; and distressed trajectory where parents experienced significant psychosocial disruption due to their child's injury and struggled to adapt and regain their wellbeing over time, remaining emotionally distressed about the circumstances and impacts of the injury on their child and family. Illustrative narratives that represent each trajectory are presented.This is the first qualitative study to report the psychosocial trajectories of parents of critically injured children. Clinical application of insights provided by these trajectories can assist clinicians to use targeted strategies to help strengthen parental adaptation and prevent adverse mental health outcomes, and address families' psychosocial support needs following child injury. Screening for parent psychological distress and post-traumatic stress disorder is needed from the time of the child's admission, and a dedicated trauma support role can facilitate an integrated care approach for children and families with complex needs across the care continuum.",0.722463092

Latent Growth Curve Modelling and Latent Class Growth Analysis were used to assess longitudinal changes in life satisfaction and the related heterogeneity within the current sample.&#x0D; Results: Three trajectories of life satisfaction emerged: high stable (37%), moderate decreasing (57%), and low stable (6%). At every time point high success expectations were related to a high stable life satisfaction trajectory. In turn, those adopting achievement avoidance strategies were more likely to have low-stable or moderately decreasing life satisfaction trajectories. The perception of the criteria deemed important to be defined as adults did not change across time points or across life satisfaction trajectories’ groups.&#x0D; Conclusion: These findings suggest that self-reported measures of achievement strategies among university students relate longitudinally to life satisfaction levels. Positive and optimistic dimensions of personal striving may be protective factors against the risk of decrease of life satisfaction among university students.&#x0D;",0.720950713

Latent class growth analysis was used to identify trajectories of weight loss (percent total weight loss), PA (Baecke questionnaire), and ES (Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire).A total of 2785 patients were included. Follow-up rate was 84% at 1 year and 34% at 5 years. Analyses revealed 5 weight loss trajectories. Most patients followed an average, fairly stable weight loss trajectory (48%) or an above-average partial-regain trajectory (36%). Other patients followed a low-responder trajectory (9%), a rapid weight loss and weight regain trajectory (6%), or a continued weight loss trajectory (2%). Patients in the most favorable weight loss trajectory were more likely to also follow the most favorable ES trajectories. Patients following the most unfavorable weight loss trajectory were never also in the PA trajectory with an initial great increase in PA.This study distinguishes demographic and behavioral factors that may influence long-term weight loss trajectories after bariatric surgery. Trajectories varied mainly in magnitude and less in the pattern of weight loss over time, suggesting that very deviant patterns are rare.",0.72058608

The purpose of this study was to describe common trajectories of physical health over time and to examine predictors of these trajectories.Adults with burn injuries completed self-reported assessments of their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by the SF-12® Physical Component Summary (PCS) score at distinct time points (preinjury via recall, index hospital discharge, and at 6-, 12-, and 24 months after injury). Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to model PCS scores over time. Covariables included burn size, participant characteristics, and scores from the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ)/Social Integration portion, Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and Satisfaction With Appearance Scale (SWAP).Data from 939 participants were used for complete-case analysis. Participants were 72% male, 64% non-Hispanic White, with an average age of 44 years and an average burn size of 20% of total body surface area (TBSA). The best fitting model suggested three distinct trajectories (Class 1 through 3) for HRQOL. We titled each Class according to the characteristics of their trajectory. Class 1 (recovering; n = 632), Class 2 (static; n = 77), and Class 3 (weakened; n = 205) reported near average HRQOL preinjury, then reported lower scores at discharge, with Class 1 subsequently improving to preinjury levels and Class 3 improving but not reaching their preinjury quality of life. Class 3 experienced the largest decrease in HRQOL. Class 2 reported the lowest preinjury HRQOL and remained low for the next 2 years, showing minimal change in their HRQOL.These findings emphasize the importance of early universal screening and sustained intervention for those most at risk for low HRQOL following injury. For Class 2 (static), lower than average HRQOL before their injury is a warning. For Class 3 (weakened), if the scores at 6 months show a large decline, then the person is at risk for not regaining their HRQOL by 24 months and thus needs all available interventions to optimize their outcomes. Results of this study provide guidance for how to identify people with burn injury who would benefit from more intensive rehabilitation to help them achieve or regain better HRQOL.

However, previous studies problematically defined the persistence of symptoms, conflated participants' sex and gender, and focused on patient populations. Therefore, we studied associations between predictors, especially sex and gender, and longitudinal patterns of somatic symptoms in the general adult population. We also assessed whether predictors for persisting symptoms differ between sexes.To identify developmental trajectories of somatic symptoms, assessed by the SCL-90 SOM, we used latent class trajectory modeling in the Dutch Lifelines Cohort Study [N = 150 494; 58.6% female; median time to follow-up: 46.0 (min-max: 22.0-123.0) months]. To identify predictors of trajectories, we applied multiple logistic regression analyses. Predictors were measured by surveys at baseline and a composite gender index was previously developed.A five-class linear LCGA model fitted the data best: 93.7% of the population had a stable symptom trajectory, whereas 1.5% and 4.8% of the population had a consistently increasing or decreasing symptom trajectory, respectively. Female sex predicted severe, stable symptom severity (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.36-2.22), but not increasing symptom severity (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.99-1.40). Femininity was protective hereof (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.82 and OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.85, respectively). Merely a few predictors of symptom severity, for instance hours of paid employment and physical functioning, differed in strength between sexes. Yet, effect sizes were small.Female sex and femininity predict symptom trajectories. No large sex differences in the strength of additional predictors were found, thus it may not be clinically useful to distinguish between predictors specific to male or female patients of persistent somatic symptoms.",0.719170059

To explore the role of adolescence and young adulthood, we investigated symptom trajectories at the transition from childhood into adulthood.Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted in a population initially recruited for the German arm of Phase II of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood and followed-up three times until their early 30s (N=2267). Indicators included in LCA were 12-month prevalences of symptoms of wheeze, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema. Latent classes were further characterised regarding important traits such as skin prick tests. Logistic regression models were used to investigate associations with environmental determinants such as smoking and occupational exposures.Six latent classes were identified: an asymptomatic one as well as three with single and two with co-occurring symptoms. All trajectories essentially established between baseline assessment at around 10 years and the first follow-up at around 17 years. Probabilities for symptoms increased from childhood to adolescence, especially for wheeze-related latent classes, while they remained constant in adulthood. Wheeze-related latent classes were also positively associated with exposures during adolescence (e.g. active smoking).Distinct trajectories of asthma and allergy symptoms establish from childhood through adolescence and stabilize during early adulthood. This pattern was most notable in wheeze-related latent classes which also showed the strongest positive associations with environmental exposures in adolescence/young adulthood. Therefore, not only childhood but also adolescence is relevant for disease development and offers considerable potential for prevention and health promotion.",0.719129865

The latent class growth modeling (LCGM) and growth mixture modeling (GMM) were used to classify different trajectory classes. Based on the identified trajectory patterns, three ML classification algorithms (i.e. gradient boosting decision tree, support vector machine and random forest) were evaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation procedure and a metric of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).Four trajectories were identified for the depressive symptoms: no symptoms (63.9%), depressive symptoms onset {incident increasing symptoms [new-onset increasing (16.8%)], chronic symptoms [slowly decreasing (12.5%), persistent high (6.8%)]}. Among the analyzed baseline variables, the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) score, cognition, sleep time, self-reported memory were the top five important predictors across all trajectories.

This study identified courses of PTG over a 2-year period in a contemporary, nationally representative sample of U.S. military veterans, and examined sociodemographic, military, trauma, medical, and psychosocial predictors of PTG course.Data were based on a Web-based survey of a nationally representative sample of 1,838 U.S. veterans who reported at least one potentially traumatic event and provided data at two time points (October-December 2011 and September-October 2013).Five different courses of PTG were identified--Consistently Low (33.6%), Moderately Declining (19.4%), Increasing PTG (16.8%), Dramatically Declining (15.7%), and Consistently High (14.5%). More than half (59.4%) of veterans who reported at least ""moderate"" PTG maintained that level of PTG 2 years later. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, medical conditions, purpose in life, altruism, gratitude, religiosity, and an active reading lifestyle predicted maintenance or increase in PTG.PTG has a heterogeneous course and is not only common, but can persist over time especially in the presence of posttraumatic stress and certain psychosocial factors.

To identify grief trajectory, we provided bereaved participants with a graphical depiction of the trajectories and asked them to select the one that best described their experience.Group comparisons revealed substantial differences between resilient and prolonged grievers, and almost no differences between resilient and married controls. Multivariate analyses indicated that prolonged grief, when compared to resilience, was uniquely associated with maladaptive dependency traits, difficulty accessing positive memories of the deceased, and higher recalled marital adjustment.The present results extend our understanding of factors associated with distinct trajectories of adjustment after loss.",0.717629235

These exposures are also subject to change throughout the life of a child. This study sought to identify multi-trajectories of maternal depression (MD) and self-reported neighborhood collective efficacy (NCE) over a 12-year period and determine whether these trajectories are differentially associated with adolescent mental health.Data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study, a longitudinal cohort study of new parents and their children, were used. Maternal depression (MD) and self-reported NCE when the child was 3, 5, 9, and 15 years of age were the primary exposures of interest. Adolescent depression and anxiety symptomology when the child was 15 years of age were the primary outcomes. Primary analyses were conducted using multi-trajectory modeling and linear regressions.Five multi-trajectories were identified, two of which were characterized by no MD but either high or low NCE, and three of which were characterized by similarly moderate levels of NCE but either increasing, decreasing, or consistently high MD. Children of mothers with increasing or consistently high depressive symptomology and moderate NCE had significantly higher depression and anxiety scores compared to children of mothers with no depressive symptomology and high NCE.Adolescents with consistent and proximal exposure to MD are most likely to suffer from adverse mental health and should be provided with appropriate support systems to mitigate these outcomes.",0.716897839

Participants were 551 active duty service members who screened positive for PTSD and/or depression based on DSM‐IV‐TR criteria. All participants completed the Combat Experiences Scale at baseline as well as PTSD and depression measures at baseline and at 3‐, 6‐, and 12‐month follow‐ups. A latent class analysis identified four classes of service members based on their combat experiences: limited exposure, medical exposure, unit exposure, and personal exposure. Service members in the personal exposure class were characterized by a distinct mental health profile: They reported a higher level of PTSD symptoms at baseline and a higher prevalence of traumatic brain injury and PTSD diagnoses during the course of the study. The limited exposure class was more likely to receive diagnoses of depression and adjustment disorders. All classes except the medical exposure class demonstrated a slight decrease in PTSD and depression symptoms over time. However, participants in the limited exposure class had a larger decrease in PTSD and depression symptoms earlier in care but did not demonstrate superior long‐term symptom improvements at 12 months compared to the other groups. These results inform PTSD development models and have implications for the screening and clinical management of combat‐exposed service members.",0.716852951

Sometimes, qualitative distinctions between trajectories with different ages of onset and/or patterns of remission are made; however, little is known about the predictors and broader clinical meaningfulness of these candidate ‘developmental subtypes’ of ADHD symptoms. Methods We applied latent class growth analysis to data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS; N = 11 316; ages 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14) to evaluate whether developmental trajectories of ADHD symptoms differing in early life predictors could be identified. Our optimal model included six trajectory groups, labelled unaffected (34.9% of the sample), mildly affected (24.1%), subclinical remitting (12.8%), pre-school onset partially remitting (14.1%), developmentally increasing (7.6%) and pre-school onset persistent (6.4%). Results Factors such as gender, conduct problems, cognitive ability, maternal education, premature birth, peer problems and school readiness scores differentiated between specific ADHD symptom trajectories.

Results Six latent classes of ATs over time were observed, characterised by persistent high, persistent low, early increasing, later increasing, high decreasing and moderate decreasing trajectories. Females were overrepresented in the later developing trajectory. General difficulties followed similar growth patterns to ATs within groups. Conclusions A six-class model characterised development of ATs. Evidence was found to support the observation that girls display symptoms later than boys and are likely to be under-diagnosed. Further characterising latent trajectory classes of ATs in the general population could improve understanding of aetiology, genetics and treatment.",0.715886397

The present study aimed to examine trajectories of secondary PTSS over a twelve-year period and its association with various measures of subjectively perceived health, among spouses of war veterans.Spouses of war veterans (n = 155) were assessed prospectively 30 (T1, 2003), 37 (T2, 2010), and 42 (T3, 2015) years after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Participants completed self-report questionnaires of PTSS (PTSD inventory) in all three measurement waves, while perceived health measures (Short-Form Health Survey-SF-36) were assessed only at T3.Most spouses were classified to the 'resilient' trajectory with low and stable secondary PTSS over time, followed by recovered, chronic, and delayed onset PTSS trajectories. Importantly, spouses in the 'chronic' and 'delayed' secondary PTSS trajectories reported a higher severity of general negative subjective health perceptions and health-related social malfunctioning.Veterans' spouses who were grouped in the 'chronic' and 'delayed' PTSS trajectories are to be considered as at-risk populations for both PTSS and negative perceived health perceptions.

Method Growth mixture modeling was used to identify latent classes of conjoint health risk trajectories (BMI, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms) from 1991 to 2001. For each latent class, we identified mean trajectories of each health risk. Then, analyses were conducted identifying how these conjoint health risk classes were associated with respondents’ socioeconomic background profiles in 1991 and subsequent chronic health problems in 2015. Results Socioeconomic background profiles were significantly associated with initially high-risk trajectories. There was a statistically significant association between membership in certain classes of conjoint trajectories and physical health outcomes in later years. Consistent patterns of association with changes in different health outcomes including onset of diseases were observed when classes of conjoint risk trajectories are examined. Discussion The identification of members of various conjoint risk trajectory groups provides a potentially useful prognostic tool for early preventive intervention efforts, treatment, and policy formation. Such interventions should promote and develop resiliency factors, thereby aiding in the redirection of middle-aged women’s adverse risk trajectories.",0.715158429

First, pain trajectory from early childhood to early adolescence were modeled. Second, we examined how early childhood individual-, parental-, and family-level factors predict pain trajectories. Third, we evaluated consequences of pain trajectories in terms of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and substance use at age 16 years.The current paper is a secondary data analysis of a multisite longitudinal study. A total of 731 children and their families were followed from ages 2 to 16 years.A growth mixture model (GMM) was used to identify pain trajectories from ages 2 to 14 years.The GMM revealed three distinct pain trajectories: (1) Low Pain Symptom (n = 572); (2) Increasing Pain Symptom (n = 106); and (3) U-shaped Pain Symptom (n = 53). Children who experienced greater harsh parenting and sleep disturbances in early childhood were more likely to belong to the Increasing Pain Symptom group, and those with greater anxious-depressed symptoms at age 2 years were more likely to belong to the U-shaped Pain Symptom group than the Low Pain Symptom group. Additionally, those youth in the Increasing Pain Symptom group, compared to the Low and U-shaped Pain Symptom groups, showed elevated anxiety symptoms at age 16 years.Reducing harsh parenting and children's sleep disturbances could be important targets for preventing pediatric pain problems.

Although environmental predictors of the longitudinal course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are documented, there remains a need to incorporate genetic risk into these models, especially in youth who are underrepresented in genetic studies. In an epidemiologic sample tornado-exposed adolescents (n = 707, 51% female, Mage = 14.54 years), trajectories of PTSD symptoms were examined at baseline and at 4-months and 12-months following baseline. This study aimed to determine if rare genetic variation in genes previously found in the sample to be related to PTSD diagnosis at baseline (MPHOSPH9, LGALS13, SLC2A2), environmental factors (disaster severity, social support), or their interplay were associated with symptom trajectories. A series of mixed effects models were conducted. Symptoms decreased over the three time points. Elevated tornado severity was associated with elevated baseline symptoms. Elevated recreational support was associated with lower baseline symptoms and attenuated improvement over time. Greater LGLAS13 variants attenuated symptom improvement over time. An interaction between MPHOSPH9 variants and tornado severity was associated with elevated baseline symptoms, but not change over time. Findings suggest the importance of rare genetic variation and environmental factors on the longitudinal course of PTSD symptoms following natural disaster trauma exposure.",0.714862211

Data were from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging Survey, 1996–2007 (N =3429). Latent class growth curves modeling and structural equation modeling were applied to examine the effect of disability trajectory as mediator on sociodemographic characteristics and on later services use. Respondents were identified in three trajectories: maintained disability (1.92%), progressive disability (10.56%), and functional independence trajectories (87.52%). The progressive disability trajectory partially and fully mediated the effects of age on later use of health care and long-term care services (the partially mediating effect on age and long-term care service use: β = 0.047, p < 0.001, for example). With the progressive disability trajectory in the model, higher education had a direct effect on greater use of long-term care services (β = 0.020, p =0.020), but through the mediating effect of the disability trajectory, education had an indirect effect on lower use of long-term care services(β = -0.025, p < 0.001). Education had fully mediating effects on the later use of inpatient (β = -0.016, p < 0.001) and emergency services (β= -0.012, p < 0.001). Preventing older adults from developing a fast-growing disability trajectory could be an effective way to decrease use of health care and long-term care services and related expenditures in late life.",0.714729044

The latent growth curve model (LGCM) and mixed growth model (GMM) were conducted on Mplus to investigate the normative development trajectory and heterogeneity of preschool children’s bullying behavior. Results showed that: (1) In general, preschool children’s bullying increased with age, and two significantly different sub-trajectories were identified through the model-fitting parameters. One was the “low-slow increasing” group, accounting for 88.47% of participants; the other group was the “high-fast decreasing” group, accounting for 11.53% of participants. (2) Peer rejection positively predicted preschool children’s bullying behavior, while peer acceptance and gender were not significant predictors. This study uncovered preschool children’s bullying behavior from a developmental perspective and provided further theoretical evidence for future intervention programs to reduce bullying behaviors.",0.714579121

We sought to characterize trajectories of depressive symptoms arising after hip fracture and examine their relationship with functional outcomes and walking ability. We also investigated clinical and psychosocial predictors of these trajectories. Method We enrolled 482 inpatients, aged ⩾60 years, who were admitted for hip fracture repair at eight St Louis, MO area hospitals between 2008 and 2012. Participants with current depression diagnosis and/or notable cognitive impairment were excluded. Depressive symptoms and functional recovery were assessed with the Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Functional Recovery Score, respectively, for 52 weeks after fracture. Health, cognitive, and psychosocial variables were gathered at baseline. We modeled depressive symptoms using group-based trajectory analysis and subsequently identified correlates of trajectory group membership. Results Three trajectories emerged according to the course of depressive symptoms, which we termed ‘resilient’, ‘distressed’, and ‘depressed’. The depressed trajectory (10% of participants) experienced a persistently high level of depressive symptoms and a slower time to recover mobility than the other trajectory groups. Stressful life events prior to the fracture, current smoking, higher anxiety, less social support, antidepressant use, past depression, and type of implant predicted membership of the depressed trajectory. Conclusions Depressive symptoms arising after hip fracture are associated with poorer functional status. Clinical and psychosocial variables predicted membership of the depression trajectory. Early identification and intervention of patients in a depressive trajectory may improve functional outcomes after hip fracture.",0.714188307

Unfortunately, not much knowledge exists about distinct trajectories of recovery from disability after LBP and their potential psychological predictors.Hence, the aim of the present study was to identify trajectories of functional disability in LBP and their potential baseline psychological predictors.A 1-year consecutive cohort (N = 1048) of patients with LBP referred to the Spine Centre if they have not improved satisfactorily from a course of treatment in primary care after 1 to 2 months were assessed by self-report questionnaires at their first visit and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Data from patients who responded to the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire at least twice (N = 747) were used to assess trajectories of functional disability by Latent Growth Mixture Modeling. The following measures were used as baseline predictors of the trajectories: Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scales, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.Four distinct trajectories were identified: high-stable (22.0%), high-decreasing (20.4%), medium-stable (29.7%), and low-decreasing (27.9%). Using the low-decreasing trajectory as reference, baseline pain intensity, depressive symptoms, and pain-catastrophizing predicted membership of all 3 symptomatic trajectories. However, using the high-decreasing trajectory as reference, age, baseline pain intensity, and depression were predictors of the high-stable trajectory.In particular, the finding of a high-stable trajectory characterized by high levels of baseline psychological distress is of potential clinical importance because psychological distress may be targeted by cognitive behavioral therapeutic approaches.",0.7139191

Although several studies have examined PNS in first-episode psychosis (FEP), a comparison with a data-driven approach is lacking. Here, we compared clinically defined PNS subgroups with class trajectories identified through latent growth modeling (LGM). Patients admitted to an early intervention service (N = 392) were classified as PNS (n = 105), secondary PNS (sPNS; n = 74), or non-PNS (n = 213) based on longitudinal data collected six to twelve months after admission. LGM was used to stratify patients based on similar negative symptom course over the same time period. Using multiple linear regression, we assessed the utility of both approaches in predicting Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) scores at two-year follow-up. Three negative symptom trajectories were identified: low and remitting (LR; n = 158), moderate and improving (MI; n = 163) and delayed partial response (DR; n = 71). Most non-PNS patients followed the LR trajectory, while patients with PNS or sPNS were generally divided between MI and DR. Both PNS classification and trajectory membership were significant predictors of two-year functional outcomes; the DR and MI trajectories predicted greater increases in SOFAS scores (DR: b = -19.14; MI: b = -11.54) than either sPNS (b = -9.19) or PNS (b = -6.46). These findings demonstrate that combining PNS and symptom-based stratification can predict functional outcomes more accurately than either taxonomy alone. Such a combined approach could yield significant advances in developing more targeted interventions for patients at risk for poor functional outcomes.",0.713852501

Beyond determining distinct QOL trajectories, identifying characteristics of patients who have different trajectories can help identify breast cancer patients who may benefit from intervention. We aimed to identify trajectories of QOL in breast cancer patients for one year after the end of primary treatment, to determine the factors influencing these changes. Methods This longitudinal study recruited 140 breast cancer patients. Patients' QOL, symptom experience, self-efficacy, and social support were assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale-G, Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form, Self-Efficacy Scale for Self-Management of Breast Cancer, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12. Data were collected immediately after the end of primary treatment (T1) and at three (T2), six (T3), and 12 months (T4) after primary treatment. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify distinct subgroups of patients with similar patterns of QOL change after treatment. A one-way analysis of variance was used to determine which variables were associated with trajectory membership. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with trajectory group membership. Results We analyzed 124 patients (mean age: 48.75 years). Latent class analysis of the QOL identified three trajectory groups: the low QOL group ( n = 27; 21.1%), moderate QOL group ( n = 57; 45.3%), and high QOL group ( n = 40; 33.6%). The low QOL group showed consistently low QOL after the end of primary treatment, and the moderate QOL group showed a slight decrease in QOL from T1 to T3, which returned to the T1 level at T4. The high QOL group maintained a consistently high QOL. By multinomial logistic regression, psychological symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22–0.99) predicted a moderate QOL, and both psychological symptoms (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07–0.51) and belonging support (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.06–2.39) predicted a high QOL. Conclusion Identifying high-risk groups for reduced QOL after the end of primary treatment is necessary. Moreover, psychosocial interventions should be provided to alleviate psychological symptoms and increase belonging support to enhance patients' QOL. Trial registration Not registered.",0.713696133

We also modeled the characteristics of children, parents, and families associated with each identified trajectory.Data came from the HERQULES (Health-Related Quality of Life in Children With Epilepsy Study), a Canada-wide prospective cohort study of children (aged 4-12 years) with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Parents reported on their children's HRQOL at diagnosis, and at 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 8-, and 10-year follow-ups using the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire-55. Trajectories of HRQOL were identified using latent class growth models. Characteristics of children, parents, and families at the time of diagnosis that were associated with each trajectory were identified using multinomial logistic regression.A total of 367 children were included. Four unique HRQOL trajectories were identified; 11% of the cohort was characterized by low and stable scores, 18% by intermediate and stable scores, 35% by intermediate scores that increased then plateaued, and 43% by high scores that increased then plateaued. Absence of comorbidities, less severe epilepsy, and better family environment (greater satisfaction with family relationships and fewer family demands) at the time of diagnosis were associated with better long-term HRQOL trajectories. Although the analyses used estimates for missing values and accounted for any nonrandom attrition, the proportion of children with poorer HRQOL trajectories may be underestimated.Children with new onset epilepsy are heterogenous and follow unique HRQOL trajectories over the long term. Overall, HRQOL improves for the majority in the first 2 years after diagnosis, with these improvements sustained over the long term.",0.713251964

Design, setting, participants Longitudinal cohort study; seven fortnightly online surveys of a representative sample of 1296 Australian adults from the beginning of COVID-19-related restrictions in late March 2020 to mid-June 2020. Main outcome measures Symptoms of depression and anxiety, measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales; trajectories of symptom change. Results Younger age, being female, greater COVID-19-related work and social impairment, COVID-19-related financial distress, having a neurological or mental illness diagnosis, and recent adversity were each significantly associated with higher baseline depression and anxiety scores. Growth mixture models identified three latent trajectories for depression symptoms (low throughout the study, 81% of participants; moderate throughout the study, 10%; initially severe then declining, 9%) and four for anxiety symptoms (low throughout the study, 77%; initially moderate then increasing, 10%; initially moderate then declining, 5%; initially mild then increasing before again declining, 8%). Factors statistically associated with not having a low symptom trajectory included mental disorder diagnoses, COVID-19-related financial distress and social and work impairment, and bushfire exposure.

We prospectively examined individual trajectories of state mindfulness in meditation during a mindfulness-based intervention in relation to changes in trait mindfulness and psychological distress. Each week during the eight-week intervention, participants reported their state mindfulness in meditation after a brief mindfulness meditation. Participants also completed pre- and post-intervention measures of trait mindfulness and psychological symptoms. Tests of combined latent growth and path models suggested that individuals varied significantly in their rates of change in state mindfulness in meditation during the intervention, and that these individual trajectories predicted pre-post intervention changes in trait mindfulness and distress. These findings support that increasing state mindfulness over repeated meditation sessions may contribute to a more mindful and less distressed disposition. However, individuals' trajectories of change may vary and warrant further investigation.",0.712920346

However, few studies have investigated the association between maternal stress and anxiety symptoms over time and child development in preschool children. The aim of this study was to examine the association between trajectories of maternal stress and anxiety symptoms from mid-pregnancy to three years postpartum and child development at age three years.Data were analyzed from 1983 mother-child dyads who participated in the three year follow-up of the All Our Families (AOF) study. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify trajectories of women's stress and anxiety across from mid-pregnancy to three years postpartum. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between the stress and anxiety trajectories and child developmental delays while adjusting for the covariates.LCA identified three distinct trajectories of maternal stress and anxiety symptoms over time. Multivariate analysis showed mothers assigned to the high anxiety symptoms class had an increased risk (adjusted OR 2.80, 95% CI 2.80 (1.42 ─ 5.51), p = 0.003) of having a child with developmental delays at 3 years.The use of self-reported maternal mental health symptoms and no data on fathers' mental health are our study's limitations.The findings from a population-based Canadian sample provide empirical support for a relationship between maternal anxiety overtime and risk of child developmental delays.

Thus, we aimed to identify trajectories of SI in a 2‐years follow‐up FEP cohort and to assess baseline predictors and clinical/functional evolution for each trajectory of SI. Methods We included 334 FEP participants with data on SI. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify trajectories of SI. Putative sociodemographic, clinical, and cognitive predictors of the distinct trajectories were examined using multinomial logistic regression. Results We identified three distinct trajectories: Non ‐ SI trajectory (85.53% sample), Improving SI trajectory (9.58%), and Worsening SI trajectory (6.89%). Multinomial logistic regression model revealed that greater baseline pessimistic thoughts, anhedonia, and worse perceived family environment were associated with higher baseline SI followed by an Improving trajectory. Older age, longer duration of untreated psychosis, and reduced sleep predicted Worsening SI trajectory. Regarding clinical/functional evolution, individuals within the Improving SI trajectory displayed moderate depression at baseline which ameliorated during the study period, while the Worsening SI subgroup exhibited persistent mild depressive symptoms and greater functional impairment at follow‐up assessments. Conclusion Our findings delineated three distinct trajectories of SI among participants with FEP, one experiencing no SI, another in which SI might depend on acute depressive symptomatology, and a last subset where SI might be associated with mild but persistent clinical and functional impairments. These data provide insights for the early identification and tailored treatment of suicide in this at‐risk population.",0.712293425

This study sought to identify depression trajectories across childhood and to model a range of child and family predictors of whether a child may be on an increasing trajectory towards depressive disorder in adolescence.

Methods
Multi-group growth mixture modelling (MGMM) was used on a sample of 4983 children from the Longitudinal Study of Australia Children (LSAC). Depressive symptoms of these children were assessed over 10-years with six time-points, administered every second year commencing at 4 years via the parent report version of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Predictors of class membership were also examined.

Results
Four trajectories were found to be the best fitting model characterising low-stable (75%); decreasing (11%); increasing (9%); high and rising (6%) groups. Females were more likely to be in a trajectory of increasing depressive symptoms between 4 and 14 years of age than males. Reactive temperament and maternal depression at four and six years of age were consistent predictors of increasing and high trajectories while persistent temperament acts as a protective factor for females.

Limitations
The findings should be interpreted in the light of limitations due to common-method variance and the absence of diagnostic indicators of depressive disorder.

Conclusions
We conclude that there are gender differences in patterns of depressive symptoms from childhood to adolescence and meaningful predictors of these early developmental trajectories. Preventative interventions in childhood targeting parents with depression and children with temperamental difficulties may be indicated.",0.711632246

The study aimed to explore the differential characteristics of each trajectory identified.Analysis of adults aged 60 years or more (n = 7 050), including a hip fracture subgroup (n = 384), from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Latent class growth mixture modeling was completed. Depressive symptom prevalence was estimated at baseline. Chi-square tests were completed to compare baseline characteristics across trajectories.Three trajectories of depressive symptoms (no, mild, and moderate-severe) were identified overall and for those with hip fracture. The moderate-severe trajectory comprised 13.7% and 7% of participants for overall and hip fracture populations, respectively. The proportion of participants with depressive symptoms in the moderate-severe trajectory was 65.4% and 85.2% for overall and hip fracture populations, respectively. Depressive symptoms were stable over time, with a weak trend toward increasing severity for the moderate-severe symptom trajectory. Participants in the moderate-severe symptom trajectory were older, more likely to be female, live alone, and had worse health measures than other trajectories (p < .001).Older adults, and those with hip fracture, follow one of the 3 trajectories of depressive symptoms that are broadly stable over time. Depressive symptoms' prevalence was higher for those with hip fracture and, when present, the symptoms were more severe than the overall population.

Our objective was to identify heterogeneous trajectories of adjustment in cancer patients, using treatment-type as a predictor.Participants were followed for 6 years within the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a prospective population-based cohort study. The sample consisted of 1,294 middle-aged participants who were assessed once before and 3 time points after their report of an initial cancer diagnosis. In addition to self-reported depressive symptoms, subjects indicated receipt of surgical, radiological, or chemical interventions as part of their usual oncological care.Four symptom trajectories were identified with Latent Growth Mixture Modeling: an increasing depression (10.5%), chronic depression (8.0%), depressed-improved (7.8%), and stable-low depression (73.7%). A conditional model using participants with available predictor data (n = 545) showed individuals in the emerging depression class were significantly more likely to have received chemo/medication therapy when compared with the remitting depression, stable-low, and chronic depression classes. Participants in the chronic and depressed-improved classes generally had worse baseline health, and the depressed-improved were also younger in age.Patients who exhibited increasing depressive symptoms had a greater probability of receiving chemo/medication therapy than any other adjustment trajectory group, although the majority of chemotherapy patients did not exhibit depressive symptom changes. These data underscore the diversity of ways that patients adjust to cancer, and suggest cancer treatment, baseline health, and age may influence long-term patterns of psychological adjustment.",0.711527178

Identifying factors associated with different trajectories and outcomes may have important theoretical and clinical implications. This study explored patterns of depressive symptom trajectory from adolescence to adulthood, and their relationship with subsequent psychiatric disorders. Method A sample of 816 participants (58.8% girls; M = 16.58 years old at baseline, SD = 1.21) from a large community sample were interviewed four times during adolescence and adulthood. Depressive symptoms were also assessed. Symptom trajectory identification was based on latent class mixed modeling. Logistic regression was used for predicting emotional and drug use disorder over age 30. Results Three trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified: “decreasing symptom” (decreasing trajectory of symptoms; 15.1% of participants), “increasing symptom” (initially decreasing pattern of symptoms and then increasing; 6.1% of participants), and “normative symptom” (consistently low symptom levels; 78.8% of participants). Predictors of the increasing symptom trajectory were high level of loneliness and state anxiety, presence of an emotional disorder, and low involvement in physical exercise at baseline. This trajectory membership predicted the development of anxiety disorders over age 30. Predictors of the decreasing symptom class were being female and high level of worry at baseline. Conclusions Long-term trajectories of depressive symptoms are heterogeneous, with each trajectory having different predictors and are associated with different outcomes during adulthood.",0.711507995

To develop such methods, factors that contribute to children's vulnerability and key signs of distress reactions after disasters need to be understood. To address these issues, we evaluated pre-disaster community violence exposure as a vulnerability factor for children's post-disaster reactions and somatic symptoms as a key post-disaster outcome. We evaluated 426 children exposed to Hurricane Katrina at two timepoints (3–7 months and 13–17 months post-disaster). Structural equation models evaluated community violence exposure, hurricane exposure, and posttraumatic stress and somatic symptoms. Community violence exposure was associated with increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms among disaster-impacted youth, and did not moderate the relationship between disaster exposure and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with somatic symptoms in the short-term recovery period (3–7 months), but not associated with somatic symptoms during the longer-term recovery period (13–17 months). This study did not include school-level factors, and somatic symptoms were based on parent reports. The study did not include parent functioning information or distinguish between whether somatic symptoms were medical or functional in nature. Post-disaster school-based screeners may need to incorporate questions related to children's past exposure to community violence and their somatic symptoms to provide trauma-informed care for children.",0.711476108

The goal of this study was to construct positive and negative symptom trajectories based on structured clinical assessments collected over 10years within a cohort of people with first episode psychosis.A cohort of 496 people with first episode psychosis (ICD-10, F20-28) originally recruited for the OPUS study (1998-2000) and treated in community psychiatric services were rated on clinical symptoms at 5 different occasions across ten years. Psychopathology was assessed using the Scales for Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms. Symptom trajectories were constructed using Latent Class Analysis.Five distinct trajectories were identified for positive symptoms (response - 47%, delayed response - 12%, relapse - 15%, non-response - 13% and episodic response - 13%). Four distinct trajectories were identified for negative symptoms (response - 28%, delayed response - 19%, relapse - 26% and non-response - 27%). Multivariable regression analysis of baseline characteristics identified that longer duration of untreated psychosis (OR 1.27-1.47, p<0.05) and substance abuse (OR 3.47-5.90, p<0.01) were associated with poorer positive symptom trajectories (higher levels of psychotic symptoms) while poor social functioning (OR 1.34-5.55, p<0.05), disorganized symptoms (OR 2.01-2.38, p<0.05) and schizophrenia diagnosis (OR 5.70-8.86, p<0.05) were associated with poorer negative symptom trajectories (higher levels of negative symptoms). A proportion of people displayed significant changes in symptoms several years after diagnosis.Trajectories of illness for positive and negative symptoms were heterogeneous among people with first episode psychosis.

This randomised controlled trial therefore aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief self-management intervention (HEDSMART) on clinical and psychological outcomes. A total of 235 haemodialysis (HD) patients were randomised to HEDSMART or standard care. Changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety over time, up to 12 months' follow-up, were explored as secondary outcomes. Latent Class Growth Analysis was employed to identify longitudinal trajectories of symptoms, demographic and clinical predictors of these trajectories, and possible effects of HEDSMART. Analyses indicated two markedly different classes of symptom progression for both depression and anxiety: a low stable class characterised by non-clinical levels of distress (resilience), and a persistent high distress class characterised by consistently high, i.e., clinically significant symptoms, over the 12 months (chronic distress). Patients who were older (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.04–1.14), non-Chinese (OR = .36, 95% CI = .20–.67), or had fewer co-morbidities (OR = .77, 95% CI = .64–.91), were more likely to be in the resilience trajectory for depression; older age (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02–1.09), and longer dialysis vintage (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02 –1.16), were also shown to be associated with resilience in terms of anxiety. Significant effects were shown for HEDSMART. Regardless of latent class membership, HEDSMART significantly predicted decreases in depressive symptoms (Est. = -.03, SE = .01, p = .025), with the effect for anxiety reduction being marginally significant (Est. = -.026, SE = .013, p= .057). A brief self-management intervention designed to support behavioural change can also lead to significant reductions in symptoms of depression. The program may be of great value for younger HD patients shown to be at greater risk for persistent distress.",0.71128073

The aim of the current study was to examine the validity of PTSD resulting from secondary traumatization by evaluating the longitudinal trajectories and clinical picture of PTSD following both direct exposure and indirect exposure to war trauma. One-hundred-and-fifty-five war veterans of the 1973 Yom Kippur War and their spouses filled out self-report questionnaires assessing PTSD, 30 (T1), 38 (T2), and 42 years (T3) after the war. Findings revealed that although PTSD was more prevalent and intense among veterans, the relative distribution of PTSD trajectories was similar among veterans and spouses. In both groups, the most prevalent was the resilient trajectory (43% and 73%, respectively), followed by the recovered trajectory (28% and 15%, respectively), the chronic trajectory (21% and 7%, respectively), and the delayed trajectory (8% and 6%, respectively). In addition, the composition of PTSD symptoms was similar among veterans and spouses at T1 and T2, but not at T3. These findings demonstrate that although PTSD is more prevalent and intense among individuals who were exposed to traumatic events directly as compared to those who were traumatized secondarily, the similarities in the clinical picture support the inclusion of secondary traumatization in PTSD Criterion A.",0.710836401

The goal of the study was to identify trajectories of pain and function outcomes up to 5 to 8 years post-TKA and to identify baseline factors that are associated with different trajectories of recovery.Baseline, 6-month, and 12-month pain and function data were collected in a previous study investigating predictors of outcome following primary TKA (n = 286), along with a variety of baseline predictor variables. The present study obtained pain and function data at 5 to 8 years following TKA in the same cohort (n = 201). Latent class linear mixed models were used to identify different classes of pain and functional trajectories over time. The extent to which differences across latent classes were explained by baseline predictor variables was determined.Three classes of pain and two classes of function trajectory were identified. While most patients (84% to 93%) followed a trajectory that showed an initial rapid gain following surgery that was sustained through 5 to 8 years, both pain and function included at least one trajectory class that showed a meaningful change after 12 months. No predictor variables were significantly associated with either the pain or function classes.Most patients follow a traditional trajectory of recovery in knee pain and function over 5 to 8 years. However, alternative trajectories are observed in an important minority of patients such that knee pain and function at 12 months after surgery does not always reflect outcomes at 5 to 8 years.",0.710797751

Parental involvement in their children's studies, particularly in terms of academic socialisation, has been shown to predict better mental health in adulthood, as well as other more favourable health outcomes, but no study published so far has examined its impact on trajectories of mental health. We therefore sought to elucidate the role of parental involvement at age 16 on the life course development of internalised mental health symptoms.In a population-based cohort (452 women and 488 men, 87% of the eligible participants), we examined the association between parental involvement in their offspring's studies, measured by teacher and pupil ratings at age 16, and an index of internalised mental health symptoms at the ages of 16, 18, 21, 30, and 43. Using latent class trajectory analysis, 5 different trajectories were derived from these indices: Very low stable (least symptoms), Low stable, Increasing, Moderate stable, and High decreasing (most symptoms). Multinomial logistic regression was used to regress trajectory membership on the parental involvement variables.Teacher-rated parental interest in their offspring's studies during the last year of compulsory school was associated with a lower risk of entering the Moderate stable (OR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.98) and High decreasing (OR = 0.41; 0.18 to 0.91) trajectories, compared with the Low stable, also after adjustment for sex, parental social class and mental health, family unemployment and own school grades. Both these associations were present only in children with grades above the national average. Student-rated availability of assistance with homework was associated with a higher chance of entering the Very low stable trajectory in the whole sample (OR = 1.24; 1.07 to 1.43), in men (OR = 1.25; 1.05 to 1.48) and in those with above average grades (OR = 1.39; 1.13 to 1.72), and with a lower risk of entering the Moderate stable in women (OR = 0.74; 0.55 to 0.99), also after the same adjustments.Parental involvement in their offspring's studies may buffer against poor mental health in adolescence which may track into adulthood.",0.709449494

To examine how physical health symptoms developed and resolved in response to Hurricane Katrina.Methods. We used data from a 2003 to 2018 study of young, low-income mothers who were living in New Orleans, Louisiana, when Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005 (n = 276). We fit logistic regressions to model the odds of first reporting or ""developing"" headaches or migraines, back problems, and digestive problems, and of experiencing remission or ""recovery"" from previously reported symptoms, across surveys.Results. The prevalence of each symptom increased after Hurricane Katrina, but the odds of developing symptoms shortly before versus after the storm were comparable. The number of traumatic experiences endured during Hurricane Katrina increased the odds of developing back and digestive problems just after the hurricane. Headaches or migraines and back problems that developed shortly after Hurricane Katrina were more likely to resolve than those that developed just before the storm.Conclusions. While traumatic experiences endured in disasters such as Hurricane Katrina appear to prompt the development of new physical symptoms, disaster-induced symptoms may be less likely to persist or become chronic than those emerging for other reasons.",0.709063933
https://openalex.org/W4361271183,10.1002/jts.22926,Recovery and adjustment trajectories among Hurricane Florence survivors: Analysis utilizing nonlinear dynamic system modeling,"Self-regulation shift theory (SRST) argues that most individuals are able to successfully recover from trauma via engagement in self-regulation processes as well as the effective utilization of internal and environmental resources. However, a minority of individuals may instead experience a self-determination violation as a result of their self-regulatory capacity being overwhelmed. This self-determination violation is marked by chaotic and shifting adjustment, maladaptive regulation attempts, and, ultimately, a shift to an impaired self-state and the development of persistent psychopathology, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The current study utilized nonlinear dynamic system (NDS) analysis to identify adjustment trajectory dynamics among rural hurricane survivors in North Carolina (N = 131) who completed daily ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) regarding their distress (i.e., negative mood and PTSD symptoms), regulation efforts (e.g., coping), and appraisals (e.g., coping self-efficacy) over a 6-week period. Four adjustment trajectories were identified, including two largely adaptive trajectories (69.0% and 5.7%), a less stable adjustment trajectory (6.9%), and a fourth trajectory (18.4%) marked by shifting adjustment states and more frequent maladaptive regulation and negative appraisals, suggesting possible self-determination violation. Consistent with this possibility, this final trajectory was also associated with more severe PTSD symptoms relative to the other three trajectories at enrollment and 6-month follow-up. Future work should utilize NDS to model posttrauma adjustment dynamics from within a SRST framework to identify patterns of positive and negative adjustment dynamics at different time points in the trauma recovery process.",0.709046622

Trajectories were identified using repeated measures latent class analysis (RMLCA). The risk profile was based on a ranking of importance of each characteristic using Cohen's d effect sizes and odds ratios. The impact of ASD and dissociation on PTSD was examined using logistic regression analyses.Altogether, 267 patients were included. The mean age was 54.0 (SD = 16.1) and 62% were men. The prevalence rate of ASD was approximately 21.7% at baseline, and 36.1% of trauma patients exhibited PTSD at 12 months after injury. Five trajectories were identified: (1) no PTSD symptoms, (2) mild, (3) moderate, (4) subclinical, and (5) severe PTSD symptoms. These trajectories seemed to remain stable over time. Compared with patients in other trajectories, patients with ASD and (subclinical) PTSD were younger and scored higher on anxiety, depressive symptoms, neuroticism, and trait anxiety. Regarding dissociation symptoms, inability to recall memories about the event was significantly more present than an altered sense of reality, (105 (40.7%) versus 56 (21.7%), p = .031), although that symptom had the strongest likelihood for PTSD. Patients with dissociation were significantly at risk for PTSD than patients without dissociation (OR = 4.82; 95%CI: 1.91-12.25).Psychological factors characterized ASD and trajectories of PTSD during 12 months post-trauma. Healthcare providers who are aware of these findings could early identify patients at risk for ASD and PTSD and refer them for patient-centred interventions.Antecedentes: El curso y las diferentes características del trastorno de estrés agudo y postraumático (TEA, TEPT) en poblaciones traumatizadas no están claros.Objetivo: Los objetivos fueron identificar las trayectorias longitudinales del TEPT, establecer un perfil de riesgo para el TEA y el TEPT basado en las características sociodemográficas, clínicas y psicológicas de los pacientes, y estudiar el efecto del TEA y la disociación en el TEPT durante los 12 meses posteriores al trauma.Método: Los pacientes completaron cuestionarios tras la inclusión y a los 3, 6, 9 y 12 meses después. Las trayectorias se identificaron mediante un análisis de clases latentes de medidas repetidas (RMLCA). El perfil de riesgo se basó en una clasificación de la importancia de cada característica utilizando los tamaños del efecto d de Cohen y cocientes de probabilidades (odds ratios). El impacto del TEA y la disociación en el TEPT se examinó mediante análisis de regresión logística.Resultados: En total, se incluyeron 267 pacientes. La edad media era de 54,0 (SD = 16,1) y el 62% eran hombres. La tasa de prevalencia de TEA fue de aproximadamente el 21,7% al inicio, y el 36,1% de los pacientes traumatizados presentaban TEPT a los 12 meses de la lesión. Se identificaron cinco trayectorias: (1) sin síntomas de TEPT, (2) leve, (3) moderada, (4) subclínica y (5) síntomas graves de TEPT. Estas trayectorias parecían permanecer estables a lo largo del tiempo. En comparación con los pacientes de otras trayectorias, los pacientes con TEA y TEPT (subclínico) eran más jóvenes y puntuaban más alto en ansiedad, síntomas depresivos, rasgos de neuroticismo y ansiedad. En cuanto a los síntomas de disociación, la incapacidad de recordar el suceso estaba significativamente más presente que la alteración del sentido de la realidad (105 (40,7%) frente a 56 (21,7%), p = 0,031), aunque este síntoma tenía la probabilidad más alta de TEPT. Los pacientes con disociación tenían un riesgo significativo de TEPT que los pacientes sin disociación (OR = 4,82; IC 95%: 1,91-12,25).Conclusiones: Los factores psicológicos caracterizaron el TEA y las trayectorias del TEPT durante los 12 meses posteriores al trauma. Los profesionales de la salud que conozcan estos hallazgos podrían identificar precozmente a los pacientes con riesgo de TEA y TEPT y remitirlos a intervenciones centradas en el paciente.背景: 创伤人群中急性和创伤后应激障碍 (ASD, PTSD) 的病程和不同特征尚不清楚。目的: 旨在确定 PTSD 的纵向轨迹, 根据患者的社会人口学, 临床和心理特征确定 ASD 和 PTSD 的风险剖面, 并研究 ASD 和解离对创伤后 12 个月内 PTSD 的影响。方法: 患者在被纳入后以及之后的 3, 6, 9 和 12 个月完成问卷。使用重复测量潜在类别分析 (RMLCA) 确定轨迹。风险剖面基于使用 Cohen’s d效应量和优势比对每个特征的重要性进行排序。使用逻辑回归分析考查 ASD 和解离对 PTSD 的影响。结果: 共纳入267 例患者。平均年龄为 54.0 (SD = 16.1), 62% 为男性。基线时 ASD 流行率约为 21.7%, 36.1% 的创伤患者在受伤后 12 个月时表现出 PTSD。确定了五个轨迹:(1) 无 PTSD 症状, (2) 轻度, (3) 中度, (4) 亚临床和 (5) 重度 PTSD 症状。随着时间的推移, 这些轨迹似乎保持稳定。与其他轨迹患者相比, 患有 ASD 和 (亚临床) PTSD 的患者更年轻, 在焦虑, 抑郁症状, 神经质和特质焦虑方面得分更高。关于解离症状, 无法回忆起事件相关记忆显著多于现实感改变 (105 (40.7%) 对 56 (21.7%), p = .031), 尽管这一症状最有可能发生 PTSD。与无解离患者相比, 有解离患者患 PTSD 的风险显著 (OR = 4.82; 95% CI:1.91-12.25)。结论: 心理因素表征了 ASD 和创伤后 12 个月内 PTSD 的轨迹。了解这些发现的医护提供者可以尽早识别出 ASD 和 PTSD 风险患者, 并为其提供以患者为中心的干预措施。.",0.708922419

We also examined the baseline individual characteristics associated with different health behavior trajectories and determined which trajectory is associated with improved cardiovascular risk outcomes at 52 weeks.This secondary analysis of a clinical trial included 200 patients admitted to primary care clinics. Latent class growth analysis was conducted to identify the trajectories of physical activity and dietary intake; these were measured at 4 different time points during a 52-week study period. Analysis of variance/χ2 test was used to assess the associations between baseline individual characteristics and trajectories, and logistic regression analysis was used to identify associations between trajectories and cardiovascular risk outcomes at 52 weeks.Three trajectories were identified for physical activity (low-, moderate-, and high-stable). Risk perception, patient activation, and depressive symptoms predicted the trajectories. High-stable trajectory for physical activity was associated with better cardiovascular risk outcomes at the 52-week follow-up. Two trajectories (low-stable and high-decreasing) were identified for percent energy from fat, but the factors that can predict trajectories were limited.Interventions are needed to target patients who begin with a lower physical activity level, with the goal of enhanced cardiovascular health. The predictors identified in the study may facilitate earlier and more tailored interventions.",0.708539701

Some experience severe, worsening or persistent psychological morbidity which impairs functioning and warrants intervention. Using Bonanno’s trajectories model, this study aimed to distinguish distress trajectories and to identify demographic, medical or psychosocial characteristics that differentiate those at risk of ongoing, clinically significant psychological distress.Methods: One-hundred and twenty-five cancer survivors of breast, prostate, colorectal or haematological cancers (response rate: 72%) completed measures of psychological distress (BSI-18), unmet needs (CASUN), social support (ESSI), coping styles (Mini-MAC), symptom prevalence (MSAS-SF) and benefit finding (PTGI) immediately after treatment and three and six months later. Distress and its predictors were investigated using linear mixed models. Groups based on Bonnano’s trajectories were also compared on demographic, medical and psychosocial characteristics.Results: Changes in psychological distress over time were not statistically significant. Using BSI-18 clinical cut-off scores, most survivors (n = 65, 80%) were ‘resilient’, with stable, low distress levels. Almost one-tenth of survivors (n = 7, 9%) reported persistent, ‘clinically significant’ distress. Compared with the ‘resilient’ group, this ‘chronic’ group reported higher unmet needs, benefit finding, physical symptoms and poor coping styles, as well as lower social support immediately after treatment. They were also more likely to have a documented history of psychiatric illness. A ‘recovered’ group (n = 5, 6%) experienced high levels of distress that quickly returned to non-clinical levels and a delayed group (n = 4, 5%) reported initial low distress which worsened after treatment completion.Conclusions: Most survivors experience low distress (resilience) over time and may not require intense follow-up care. Screening for distress at the end of treatment may help to identify patients with more physical symptoms and unmet needs, less social support and higher use of maladaptive coping styles who are at risk of experiencing non-resilient trajectories of distress for further management of these symptoms.",0.708484232

Longitudinal studies starting in the direct aftermath of exposure with repeated follow‐up are needed. Method We assessed health and developmental outcomes in 6‐month intervals over 2 years in 173 children, aged 3–5 years at study entry, including 86 children with exposure to emotional and physical abuse or neglect within 6 months and 87 nonmaltreated children. Assessments included clinician‐administered, self‐ and parent‐report measures of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, development, and physical health. Linear mixed models and latent growth curve analyses were used to contrast trajectories between groups and to investigate the impact of maltreatment features on trajectories. Results Maltreated children exhibited greater numbers of psychiatric diagnoses ( b = 1.998, p &lt; .001), externalizing ( b = 13.29, p &lt; .001) and internalizing ( b = 11.70, p &lt; .001) symptoms, impairments in cognitive ( b = −11.586, p &lt; .001), verbal ( b = −10.687, p &lt; .001), and motor development ( b = −7.904, p = .006), and greater numbers of medical symptoms ( b = 1.021, p &lt; .001) compared to nonmaltreated children across all time‐points. Lifetime maltreatment severity and/or age at earliest maltreatment exposure predicted adverse outcomes over time. Conclusion The profound, immediate, and stable impact of maltreatment on health and developmental trajectories supports a biological embedding model and provides foundation to scrutinize the precise underlying mechanisms.

About 3 years after the accident, we identified three patterns of peer relationship problems and four patterns of emotional symptoms using group-based trajectory modeling. As a result, we reported that different factors might be related to very severe trajectories of peer relationship problems and emotional symptoms. In this study, we used five waves of data from fiscal year (FY) 2011 to FY2015 from the Mental Health and Lifestyle Survey, a detailed survey of the Fukushima Health Management Survey started in FY2011. We analyzed 7013 residents within the government-designated evacuation zone (aged 6–12 years old as of 11 March 2011) with responses to all items of psychological distress in at least one wave from FY2011 and FY2015. We planned this study to describe the trajectories of peer relationship problems and emotional symptoms in children and to examine potential risks and protective factors over the 5 years following the NPS accident. We identified four patterns of peer relationship problems and five patterns of emotional symptoms using latent class growth analysis. For peer relationship problems, male sex, experiencing the NPS explosion and lack of exercise habits were associated with the severe trajectory group. For emotional symptoms, experiencing the NPS explosion, experiencing the tsunami disaster and lack of exercise habits were associated with the severe trajectory group. Exercise habits are very important for the mental health of evacuees after a nuclear disaster.",0.707439211

Thus, the objective of the current study was to determine whether emotion dysregulation could prospectively predict the development of chronic PTSD symptoms following a traumatic event above and beyond other known associated factors, including depressive symptoms, baseline PTSD symptoms, total traumas experienced, and exposure to interpersonal trauma. Participants (N = 135) were recruited from the emergency department (ED) at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta and follow-up assessments were conducted at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-months following trauma exposure. Latent Growth Mixture Modeling was used to identify PTSD symptom trajectories based on symptoms assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months; three trajectories emerged: ""chronic"", ""recovery"", and ""resilient"". For the present study, probability of chronic PTSD symptoms was used as the outcome variable of interest. Linear regression modeling showed that emotion dysregulation was significantly associated with probability of developing chronic PTSD symptoms (p = 0.001) and accounted for an additional 7% of unique predictive variance when controlling for trauma exposure, baseline PTSD, and depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest that emotion dysregulation can be used as both a predictor of chronic PTSD and as a treatment target. Thus, identifying individuals with high levels of emotion dysregulation at the time of trauma and implementing treatments designed to improve emotion regulation could aid in decreasing the development of chronic PTSD among these at-risk individuals.",0.70691864

Understanding this developmental discrepancy requires first understanding the developmental trajectory of SSS. The objective of this study was to identify the number and shape of SSS trajectories as adolescents transition to adulthood and explore if trajectory membership affects health. METHODS: Using data from 7436 assessments from the Princeton School District Study, a decade-long cohort study of non-Hispanic black and white youth, latent class growth models with 3 to 7 SSS trajectories were developed. Model fit, trajectory structure, and shape were used to guide optimal model selection. Using this optimal model, the associations of trajectory membership with BMI and depressive symptoms in young adulthood were explored. RESULTS: The 5-class model was optimal. In this model, trajectories were persistent high (7.8%), mid–high (32.2%), middle (43.4%), low–lower (7.4%), and high–low (9.1%). Non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, lower household income, and low parent education were associated with membership in this high–low trajectory. High–low trajectory membership was associated with higher BMI and depressive symptoms in non-Hispanic white subjects but was not associated with depressive symptoms. It was associated with lower BMI only after adjustment for BMI in adolescence in non-Hispanic black subjects. CONCLUSIONS: SSS is relatively stable in adolescence and the transition to adulthood, and it generally reflects objective markers of social advantage. However, socially disadvantaged youth with high SSS in early adolescence may be at increased health risk.",0.706852925

This study aims to explore how social adversities in adolescence predict trajectories of internalized mental health symptoms (IMHS), from adolescence and onward until middle age.Based on 1040 individuals from the Northern Swedish Cohort Study, a community-based cohort with 27 years of follow-up. We applied latent class growth analysis to extract trajectories of IMHS between ages 16 and 43. Multinomial logistic regression was used to study the association of social adversities (residential mobility, residential crowding, parental loss, unemployment of a parent, physical illness of a parent, mental illness or alcohol problems of a parent) in adolescence with IMHS trajectories.Five trajectory classes were identified: 'very low stable' (26% of the sample), 'low stable' (58%), 'moderate stable' (5%), 'increasing' (8%) and 'high decreasing' (3%). Both in men and women, reporting social adversities at the age of 16 increased the risk of belonging to the classes with less favourable development of IMHS. Reporting adversities was positively associated with the initial level of the IMHS trajectories. Thus it seems that the influence of adversities is more pronounced during the early years of follow-up and is attenuated over time.Experiencing social adversities in adolescence increases the risk of entering unfavourable developmental trajectories of mental health until middle age.",0.706394746

HNSS was assessed with the MDASI-HN (range 0-10) at baseline (BL), weekly during CRT (weeks (w) 1-7) and then 1, 3, 5, 9 and 13w and 6, 12 and 24 months (m) post CRT. HRQL was assessed using the FACT-G (range 0-108) at BL, and 7w, 6m, 12m and 24m post CRT. Latent class growth mixture modelling (LCMM) was performed to identify trajectories. Mean estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated at each time point. <h3>Results</h3> The HNSS model identified 4 trajectory classes (HNSS1-4) distinguished by differences in HNSS at BL, during the peak of treatment symptoms (w7 CRT/1w post CRT) and during early (1w to 9w post CRT) and intermediate recovery (9w to 12m post CRT). The trajectories of all 4 classes were stable beyond 12m. The reference trajectory (HNSS4, n=74) score was 0.1 (CI 0.1-0.2) at BL, peaking at 4.6 (CI 4.2-5.0), with rapid early recovery (1.1, CI 0.8-2.2) and gradual improvement to 12m (0.6, CI 0.5-0.8). HNSS2 (""high BL"", n=30) reported higher BL scores (1.4, CI 0.8-2.0) but was otherwise similar, HNSS3 (""low acute"", n=53) reported reduced acute symptoms (2.5, CI 2.2-2.9) with stable scores beyond 9w post CRT (1.1, CI 0.9-1.4). HNSS1 (""slow recovery"", n=25) had slower recovery from an acute peak of 4.9 (CI 4.3-5.6) to 0.9 (CI 0.6-1.3) at 12m. Compared to HNSS4, the high BL group were younger (mean 53.6 vs 57.4), with fewer ECOG0 (87 vs 99%) or with higher degree (38 vs 69%), and higher baseline anxiety (HADS, mean 6.8 vs 4.4). The low acute group were older (mean 60.1), had fewer ECOG0 patients (87%) and were more likely to have received cetuximab (68% vs 43%). The slow recovery group had fewer with a higher degree (52%). The HRQL model included 2 trajectory classes. The reference trajectory (HRQL2, n=156) scores were 90 (CI 88-92) at BL, similar 7w post CRT (88, CI 85-90) with slow but clinically meaningful improvement to 12m (98, CI 96-100). HRQL1 (n=26) had lower BL mean scores (80, CI 74-86), with a significant decline at 7w post CRT (57, CI 50-63) and a slower recovery to BL scores over 12m (83, CI 72-94). Both trajectories were flat beyond 12m. The slow recovery group were older (mean 61.1 vs 56.8), with worse BL anxiety (mean 6.5 vs 4.4) and depression (mean 4.5 vs 2.1). In addition, LCMM identified 4 trajectories for head and neck symptom interference, 3 for anxiety and 4 for depression, which will be presented. <h3>Conclusion</h3> LCMM identified distinct trajectories of HNSS and HRQL during and after CRT. These and their associations with variations in HPVOPC patients' characteristics and treatment factors provide clinically relevant insights into identifying patients who may require increased support during and after CRT.",0.706252902

Little is known about individual differences in their long-term psychological adaptation and its predictors from multiple aspects of their life. This study aims to identify heterogeneous trajectories of probable psychiatric conditions and their predictors. Participants included 574 juvenile offenders who were first convicted for serious crimes and without detention history. The participants were assessed at 11 timepoints over seven years (2000–2010). Growth mixture modeling revealed the same three trajectories for both probable anxiety and probable depression: stable low trajectory (75.96%; 75.78%), stable high trajectory (15.16%; 10.98%), and recovery (8.89%, 13.24%). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression identified three multilevel predictors for memberships of different trajectories. Risk factors against stable low trajectory lay within personal (e.g., neuroticism), relationship (e.g., parental hostility), and contextual levels (e.g., chaotic neighborhood). Resilience factors for stable low trajectory included strong work orientation and low education level of father. Recovery was predicted by Black race, self-identity, high education level of father, and nonincarcerated sentencing. Our findings suggest that both psychopathology and psychological resilience could be predicted by multiple personal, relationship, and contextual factors in the social ecology of juvenile offenders.",0.706164804

Latent growth mixture models were fit to identify longitudinal trajectories for past 30-day ENDS, cigarette, and cannabis use over a 4.5-year period. Class membership was regressed on baseline depressive symptoms in multinomial regression models.Four trajectory classes were identified for each product: abstainer/minimal, decreasing, increasing, and high. Depressive symptoms were associated with a greater likelihood of belonging to the decreasing, increasing, and high trajectory classes relative to the abstainer/minimal class for all products, with the exception of the increasing ENDS class and the decreasing cannabis class.The findings demonstrate that there is considerable similarity across trajectories of ENDS, cigarette, and cannabis use during traditional collegiate years. Furthermore, depressive symptoms increased the likelihood of belonging to substance using trajectory classes for all products.",0.705453714

The multinomial logistic regression model was used to identify variables associated with different trajectory groups.Both depression and anxiety in the new college students slightly increased during the 16-month period. The slopes of depression and anxiety were lower after the local outbreak. From the trajectories of depression and anxiety, five heterogeneous groups were identified: low-stable (64.3%), moderate-increased (18.2%), high-stable (11.1%), recovery (4.5%), and rapid-increased (1.8%). Environmental, somatic, and social factors were used to differentiate the low-stable group from the other groups. We found that college students with female gender, more conflict with parents, and feelings of loneliness during the pandemic were more likely to enter a high stability trajectory compared to a recovery trajectory.Most participants showed a stable mental health status, while others experienced deteriorating or chronic mental health problems, especially those who had sleep disturbances, less social support before the pandemic, or conflicts with parents during the pandemic. These students may need additional support and monitoring from college mental health providers to improve their wellbeing.",0.705150843

This study examines how the course of symptoms from ages 16–25 influences early adult education and employment in Canada and the USA. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (n = 2348) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79 Child/Young Adult (n = 3961), four trajectories (low-stable; increasing; decreasing; and increasing then decreasing, i.e., mid-peak) were linked to five outcomes (working with a post-secondary degree; a high school degree; no degree; in school; and NEET, i.e., not in employment, education, or training). In both countries, increasing, decreasing, and mid-peak trajectories were associated with higher odds of working with low educational credentials, and/or NEET relative to low-stable trajectories. In Canada, however, all trajectories had a higher predicted probability of either being in school or working with a post-secondary degree than the other outcomes; in the USA, all trajectory groups were most likely to be working with a high school degree. Higher depressive symptom levels at various points between adolescent and adulthood are associated with working with low education and NEET in Canada and the USA, but Canadians are more likely to have better education and employment outcomes.",0.705102739

Studies have not assessed whether latent class ACEs trajectories affect adolescent problem behaviors and conditions.We used longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS, n = 3444) to assess ACEs at several time points and empirically developed latent class trajectories. We then examined the sociodemographic characteristics of youth who belonged to each trajectory group. We next evaluated whether the ACEs trajectories during childhood were associated with delinquent behavior, substance use, and symptoms of anxiety or depression. Finally, we explored whether closeness to mother buffered the impact of ACEs on these outcomes.Eight types of ACEs were captured in the FFCWS data. ACE scores were assessed at year one, three, five, and nine, along with the outcomes during year 15. Trajectories were estimated with a semiparametric latent class models.The analysis revealed three latent trajectories during childhood: a low/none ACEs group, a medium exposure group, and a high exposure group. Adolescents in the high exposure group manifested a heightened risk of involvement in delinquent behaviors and substance use. They also reported more symptoms of anxiety and depression than their peers in the low/none and medium exposure groups.Repeated exposure to ACEs during childhood can have serious negative repercussions in the lives of adolescents, but maternal closeness may buffer their effects. Scholars should continue to examine the dynamics of ACEs exposure during childhood by using empirical approaches appropriate for identifying age-graded trajectories.",0.704782946

Evidence from longitudinal studies suggests that affected women do not constitute one homogeneous group in terms of severity, chronicity, and onset of symptoms. To account for individual differences regarding the longitudinal course of depressive symptoms from pregnancy to the postpartum period, growth mixture models have proven to be useful. Methods: We conducted a group-based trajectory modeling analysis to identify perinatal depressive symptom trajectories in a Swiss sample ( n = 151). Depressive symptoms were assessed six times, covering nearly 6 months from the third trimester of pregnancy to 3 months postpartum. In addition to determining perinatal depressive symptom trajectories, we aimed to examine whether these trajectories are linked to psychopathological risk factors such as a history of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), anxiety, prenatal stress, and somatic symptoms after delivery that are associated with hormonal fluctuations. Results: The findings revealed three trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms that were relatively stable over time and differed in symptom load (low, medium, high), as well as one trajectory of decreasing symptoms, with a significant symptom reduction after giving birth. Women with a higher depressive symptom load experienced a greater degree of prior premenstrual symptoms, prenatal anxiety, and birth anxiety, as well as somatic symptoms after delivery. Conclusion: Further research is needed to account for the distinct trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms in order to provide appropriate care for affected women. A focus on somatic symptoms after delivery and their association with depressive mood is essential to better understand the potential shared etiopathology of reproductive transition phase mood disorders.",0.704600456
https://openalex.org/W2907019276,,The Influence of Pain on the Development of PTSD Across the Acute Post Trauma Period,"Exposure to potentially traumatic events is fairly common among US adults, yet only a small fraction develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear, however, why some individuals develop PTSD and others do not. Higher pain after a traumatic injury has been associated with higher PTSD symptomology and may be a risk factor for developing PTSD. However, few studies have examined symptoms during the period immediately after a trauma to determine how they relate to PTSD outcome. The goal of this study was to identify trajectories of pain throughout the first month after a traumatic injury and examine their relation to PTSD symptoms at 1 month. A sample of (n = 88) individuals who had experienced a traumatic injury assessed their pain through daily mobile assessments for the first month after injury. Daily mobile assessments consisted of self-report surveys sent to the participants’ mobile device. A follow-up interview was conducted at 1 month after injury to assess PTSD symptomology. Using growth mixture modeling, three trajectories of pain were identified: low pain, decreasing pain, and persistent high pain. Membership to the low pain group was associated with lower PTSD, depression and disability symptoms at 1 month after injury. Membership to the high pain group was associated with higher levels of PTSD, depression and disability symptoms at 1 month. These results demonstrate that there are distinct trajectories of pain after a traumatic injury and these trajectories may relate to later symptoms of psychopathology.",0.704394638

The aim of the present study was to examine the course of PTS up to three years after losing relatives in the MS Estonia ferry disaster, one of the worst maritime disasters in modern times.Seven postal surveys were sent out over three years post-disaster. The respondents were invited and added consecutively during the three years and 938 relatives participated in one or more of the surveys, representing 89% of the MS Estonia's Swedish victims. The survey included the Impact of Event Scale (IES) to measure PTS. Latent growth curve modeling was used to analyze PTS over time.The majority of bereaved individuals had high levels of PTS. At three years post-loss, 62% of the respondents scored above the recommended cut-off value on the IES. Over time, PTS symptoms declined, but initially high symptoms of PTS were associated with a slower recovery rate.The present finding suggests that being an indirectly-exposed disaster-bereaved close-relative can lead to very high levels of PTS which are sustained for several years.",0.703815006

Typically, researchers have captured different course types using broad pre-defined categories. However, whether these adequately capture symptom trajectories of psychotic disorders has not been fully assessed. Using data from AESOP-10, we sought to identify classes of individuals with specific symptom trajectories over a 10-year follow-up using a data-driven approach.AESOP-10 is a follow-up, at 10 years, of 532 incident cases with a first episode of psychosis initially identified in south-east London and Nottingham, UK. Using extensive information on fluctuations in the presence of psychotic symptoms, we fitted growth mixture models to identify latent trajectory classes that accounted for heterogeneity in the patterns of change in psychotic symptoms over time.We had sufficient data on psychotic symptoms during the follow-up on 326 incident patients. A four-class quadratic growth mixture model identified four trajectories of psychotic symptoms: (1) remitting-improving (58.5%); (2) late decline (5.6%); (3) late improvement (5.4%); (4) persistent (30.6%). A persistent trajectory, compared with remitting-improving, was associated with gender (more men), black Caribbean ethnicity, low baseline education and high disadvantage, low premorbid IQ, a baseline diagnosis of non-affective psychosis and long DUP. Numbers were small, but there were indications that those with a late decline trajectory more closely resembled those with a persistent trajectory.Our current approach to categorising the course of psychotic disorders may misclassify patients. This may confound efforts to elucidate the predictors of long-term course and related biomarkers.",0.703745554

As there are many negative consequences of postpartum depressive symptoms, it is important to examine possible protective factors, such as trait mindfulness. Since postpartum depressive symptoms are variable over time between and within individuals, this study focused on the possible association between facets of trait mindfulness and trajectories of postpartum depressive symptoms throughout the first postpartum year.A subsample of 713 women that participated in the HAPPY study completed the Three Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form at 22 weeks of pregnancy and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at six weeks, four months, eight months, and twelve months postpartum. Possible different EPDS trajectories were obtained by means of growth mixture modeling.Two EPDS trajectories (classes) were found: a low stable symptom class (N = 647, 90.7%) and an increasing-decreasing symptom class (N = 66, 9.3%). Women in the low stable class showed higher 'acting with awareness' and 'non-judging' scores. A higher score on the 'non-judging' facet of trait mindfulness was associated with a higher likelihood of belonging to the low stable class (OR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.72, 0.87], p < 0.001), adjusted for confounders and the other mindfulness facets.The non-judging facet of trait mindfulness was associated with low stable levels of depressive symptoms during the first postpartum year.

Distress follows distinct trajectories within different population subgroups. Identifying characteristics and causes of trajectories can assist intervention development and targeting. In a 7-year study of uveal melanoma survivors, we aimed to characterize anxiety, depression, and fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) trajectories, and identify whether concerns about symptoms and functional problems over the first 3 years of survivorship predict memberships of high distress trajectories.In a closed cohort study, we used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to identify statistically optimal trajectories over 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-, 60-, 72-, and 84-month time point posttreatment in 475 patients. We then regressed trajectory memberships onto a 3-year series of measures of concerns about symptoms and functional problems, controlling demographic, clinical, and 6-month anxiety, depression, or FCR indicators.Anxiety, depression, and FCR were represented by two-class linear GMMs. The majority scored consistently low, but 17.5% showed consistently elevated anxiety, 10.9% consistently elevated depression, and 19.4% consistently elevated FCR. Higher anxiety trajectory membership was predicted by greater concerns about symptoms at 6 and 24 months, higher depression trajectory membership by symptoms at 24 months, and higher FCR trajectory membership by symptoms at 6 and 24 months and functional problems at 12 months.Much of the burden of persistent distress in cancer patients falls on a small proportion of survivors. Concerns about symptoms and functional problems are potential risk factors for distress. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",0.702824881

We used growth mixture modelling to identify trajectories of depression, anxiety and anhedonia symptoms using the 12-month data. We identified sociodemographic predictors of trajectory class membership using multinomial regression models.Most participants had consistently low symptoms of depression or anxiety over the year of assessments (60%, 69% respectively), and a minority had consistently high symptoms (10%, 15%). We also identified participants who appeared to show improvements in symptoms as the pandemic progressed, and others who showed the opposite pattern, marked symptom worsening, until the second national lockdown. Unexpectedly, most participants showed stable low positive affect, indicating anhedonia, throughout the 12-month period. From regression analyses, younger age, reporting a previous mental health diagnosis, non-binary, or self-defined gender, and an unemployed or a student status were significantly associated with membership of the stable high symptom groups for depression and anxiety.While most participants showed little change in their depression and anxiety symptoms across the first year of the pandemic, we highlight the divergent responses of subgroups of participants, who fared both better and worse around national lockdowns. We confirm that previously identified predictors of negative outcomes in the first months of the pandemic also predict negative outcomes over a 12-month period.",0.702808945

A total of 3871 students participated in assessments performed at three time points at one-year assessment intervals. Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to estimate trajectory classes for suicidal behaviors, followed by multivariable logistic regression to explore the association between predictive factors and classes.GMM analyses extracted two distinct trajectories of suicidal behaviors: a low-decreasing group (n = 3669, 94.8 %) and a high-increasing group (n = 202, 5.2 %). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that depressive symptoms, non-suicidal self-injury, hopelessness, and childhood emotional abuse served as risk factors for the high-increasing group, while reasons for living served as protective factors.Psychological interventions aimed at reducing the influence of risk factors and bolstering reasons to live may help to decrease the risk of suicide behaviors in college students.",0.702487374

Then, we assessed the bidirectional interactions between wellbeing and psychological symptoms, and the effect of each predictor on each outcome controlling for baseline values.Results: Symptom improvement was identified in all trials, and for wellbeing in 64.7% of participants in Europe and Turkey, versus 31.5% in Uganda. In Europe and Turkey domestic violence predicted increased symptoms at post-intervention (ß = 1.36, 95% CI 0.17–2.56), whilst murder of family members at 6-month follow-up (ß = 1.23, 95% CI 0.27–2.19). Lower wellbeing was predicted by murder of family member (ß = −1.69, 95% CI −3.06 to −0.32), having been kidnapped (ß = −1.67, 95% CI −3.19 to −0.15), close to death (ß = −1.38, 95% CI −2.70 to −0.06), and being in the host country ≥2 years (ß = −1.60, 95% CI −3.05 to −0.14). In Uganda at post-intervention, having been kidnapped predicted increased symptoms (ß = 2.11, 95% CI 0.58–3.65), and lack of shelter (ß = −2.51, 95% CI −4.44 to −0.58) and domestic violence predicted lower wellbeing (ß = −1.36, 95% CI −2.67 to −0.05).Conclusion: Many participants adapt to adversity, but contextual factors play a critical role in determining mental health trajectories.",0.702356902

Latent growth curve analysis was used to identify distinct trajectory classes. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between baseline characteristics and the newly constructed trajectories. Cox proportional hazards regression models examined the hazard of mortality as a function of Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) trajectories.The study follow-up period was approximately 9.5 years. One thousand four hundred and eleven adults were successfully classified into three (low-declining, high-declining, and high-stable) physical performance trajectory classes. Depressive symptoms (relative risk ratio = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17-3.22), diabetes (relative risk ratio = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.63-3.65), number of other comorbid health conditions (relative risk ratio = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.16-1.68), and obesity (relative risk ratio = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.67-4.80), increased the relative risk of classification into the low, relative to high-stable trajectory class. Male gender and foreign-born status significantly reduced risk of classification in the low-declining and high-declining trajectory classes. We observed a statistically significant association between low-declining (hazard ratio = 3.01, 95% CI = 2.34-3. 87) and high-declining (hazard ratio = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.32-2.03) trajectories and increased risk of mortality.Differences in mortality across physical performance trajectory classes suggest that these physical performance classes represent differences in underlying disease progression, and thus differences in mortality risk among older Mexican Americans, which warrants additional research to better understand differential physical performance trajectories and their effects on morbidity and mortality in heterogeneous aging populations.",0.702159465

Methods We analyzed data from a prospective mailed survey study of 396 adults living with MCC in southeastern Minnesota, USA. Participants completed a measure of treatment burden, the Patient Experience with Treatment and Self-management (PETS), and valid measures of health-related and psycho-social concepts at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months. Latent class growth mixture modeling (LCGM) determined trajectories of treatment burden in two summary index scores of the PETS: Workload and Impact. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify independent predictors of the trajectories. Results LCGM supported a 2-class model for PETS Workload, including a group of consistently high workload ( N = 69) and a group of consistently low workload ( N = 311) over time. A 3-class model was supported for PETS Impact, including groups of consistently high impact ( N = 62), consistently low impact ( N = 278), and increasing impact ( N = 51) over time. Logistic regression analyses showed that the following factors were associated with patterns of consistently high or increasing treatment burden over time: lower health literacy, lower self-efficacy, more interpersonal challenges with others, and worse subjective reports of physical and mental health (all p &lt; .05). Conclusions Different longitudinal patterns of treatment burden exist among people with MCC. Raising health literacy, enhancing self-efficacy, and lessening the effects of negative social interactions might help reduce treatment burden.",0.701978041

Adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis were recruited across multiple centers. Latent growth mixture modeling techniques were used to determine pain trajectories over the first postoperative year.The median numerical rating scale for pain in the hospital following surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis was 5.0. It improved to 1.0 by 6 weeks, and was maintained at <1 by 3 to 12 months postoperatively. Three trajectories were identified, 2 of which involved moderate acute postoperative pain: 1 with good resolution and 1 with incomplete resolution by 1 year. The third trajectory involved mild acute postoperative pain with good resolution by 1 year. Membership in the ""moderate pain with incomplete resolution"" trajectory was predicted by higher baseline pain and anxiety, and patients in this trajectory reported worse quality of life than those in the trajectories with good resolution.Pain recovery following surgery for idiopathic scoliosis was found to be substantial during the first 6 weeks and continued up to 1 year. We identified 3 main trajectories, 2 with favorable outcomes and 1 with persistent pain and worse quality of life at 1 year postoperatively. The risk factors most associated with the latter trajectory included increased baseline pain and anxiety.Prognostic Level II.

However, a proportion of exposed individuals experienced posttraumatic growth (PTG), characterized by a noticeable degree of personal strength, spirituality, life appreciation, perception of new possibilities in life, and enhanced relationships with others. Some researchers have argued that these positive reactions may be an illusory change related to coping with traumatic events. We examined trajectory patterns related to PTG Inventory (PTGI) subscales to elucidate the existence of both real and illusory growth regarding quality of life (QoL), utilizing group‐based trajectory models. Three online questionnaires were distributed at 6 months ( N = 2,554; M age = 47.04 years, SD = 12.62), 12 months ( N = 887; M age = 48.11 years, SD = 12.43), and 42 months ( N = 560; M age = 48.86 years, SD = 12.25) postdisaster. Participants responded to items related to demographic characteristics, disaster experiences, posttraumatic stress symptoms, PTG, and QoL. Three main PTG trajectories emerged, characterized by growth, no growth, and illusory growth, with QoL as a time invariant covariate. Compared with the growth trajectory, the odds ratios ( OR s) for no growth ranged from 2.27 to 5.04; for illusory growth, the OR s ranged from 2.09 to 4.67. To our knowledge, this was the first study to report growth trajectories related to PTGI subscales and their underlying differences in psychological mechanisms and processes following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.",0.701590719

Yet there is a dearth of research in military populations on the longitudinal patterns of alcohol use. This study aims to identify group trajectories of alcohol consumption in the UK military and to identify associations with childhood adversity, deployment history and mental disorder. Data on weekly alcohol consumption across an eight year period and three phases of a UK military cohort study (n = 667) were examined using growth mixture modelling. Five alcohol trajectory classes were identified: mid-average drinkers (55%), abstainers (4%), low level drinkers (19%), decreasing drinkers (3%) and heavy drinkers (19%). Alcohol consumption remained stable over the three periods in all classes, other than in the small decreasing trajectory class. Individuals in the heavy drinking class were more likely to have deployed to Iraq. Abstainers and heavy drinkers were more likely to report post-traumatic stress disorders at baseline compared to average drinkers. Heavy drinkers in the UK military did not change their drinking pattern over a period of eight years. This highlights the need to develop effective preventive programmes to lessen the physical and psychological consequences of long-term heavy alcohol use. Individuals with a mental health problem appeared more likely to either be drinking at a high level or to be abstaining from use.",0.701340049

There is a significant gap in the literature on trauma and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in unaccompanied young refugees who are still on the move and live in precarious circumstances such as refugee camps. This study therefore aimed to contribute to this gap by investigating pre- and peri-migration (potentially) traumatic experiences of unaccompanied young refugees; longitudinal trajectories of trauma, daily stressors and PTSS; and the impact of gender, trauma, and daily stressors on PTSS over time. Methods This longitudinal, mixed-method, and multi-country study was conducted in various settings (e.g. refugee camps, reception centers) across nine European countries. A heterogeneous sample of N = 187 unaccompanied young refugees (78.4% male) from 29 different countries was assessed via interviews at 3 time-points during a period of 27 months. Data was analyzed via growth curve modelling. Results Prevalence rates of (potentially) traumatic experiences ranged from 29.5 to 91.9%. Peri-migration traumatization remained stable over time ( b = − 0.02; p = 0.371), but the number of reported daily stressors ( b = − 0.24; p = 0.001) and PTSS scores significantly decreased over time ( b = − 0.98; p = 0.004). Females reported higher PTSS compared with males at baseline ( p = 0.002), but gender did not influence the longitudinal trajectory of PTSS. The pre-migration trauma load and daily stressors at baseline did not have a significant effect on PTSS at baseline or on the longitudinal trajectory. Conclusions This is the first study to document not only the high numbers of traumatic events for unaccompanied young refugees pre- and peri- migration, but also the continued traumatization during flight, as well as high rates of daily stressors and PTSS. Humanitarian and political assistance is urgently needed to curb the often life-threatening conditions unaccompanied young refugees face during migration.",0.70082203

Using growth mixture modeling approaches, we aimed to investigate group-level heterogeneities in the growth trajectories of children aged 1 to 15 years. Method This longitudinal study examined group-level growth heterogeneities in a sample of 3401 males and 3200 females. Data were analyzed using growth mixture modeling approaches. Results We examined different trajectories of growth change in children across four low- and middle-income countries using a data-driven growth mixture modeling technique. The study identified two-group trajectories: the most male samples group ( n = 4260, 69.7%) and the most female samples group ( n = 2341, 81.6%). The findings show that the two groups had different growth trajectories. Gender and country differences were shown to be related to growth factors; however, the association varied depending on the trajectory group. In both latent groups, females tended to have lower growth factors (initial height and rate of growth) than their male counterparts. Compared with children from Ethiopia, children from Peru and Vietnam tended to exhibit faster growth in height over time: In contrast, children from India showed a lower rate of change in both latent groups than that of children from Ethiopia. Conclusions The height of children in four low- and middle-income countries showed heterogeneous changes over time with two different groups of growth trajectories.",0.700305308

Structural equation models then used these classes to predict depressive symptoms at age 15.Five latent classes captured continuity and change in weight from early childhood into middle adolescence. Controlling for current weight, stably overweight girls tended to have the most depressive symptoms, but popularity and positive image appeared to buffer against some of the risks that girls faced from being stably overweight or becoming overweight in early to middle childhood. Notably, boys' longitudinal weight patterns were not associated with their depressive symptoms in adolescence.Weight histories, controlling for current weight, are important for understanding the psychological experience of overweight, especially when such histories are considered in relation to other aspects of psychosocial functioning.

Research indicates variation in the trajectory of PTSS following pediatric injury, but investigation of PTSS following concussion has assumed homogeneity. This study aimed to identify differential trajectories of PTSS following pediatric concussion and to investigate risk factors, including acute post-concussive symptoms (PCS), associated with these trajectories. A total of 120 children ages 8–18 years reported PTSS for 3 months following concussion diagnosis using the Child PTSD Symptom Scale, with a score of 16 or above indicating probable post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Age, gender, injury mechanism, loss of consciousness, previous concussions, prior hospitalization, prior diagnosis of depression or anxiety, and acute PCS were assessed as risk factors. Data were analyzed using group-based trajectory modeling. Results revealed 16% of children had clinically significant PTSS 2 weeks post-concussion, declining to 10% at 1 month and 6% at 3 months post-injury. Group-based trajectory modeling identified three trajectories of PTSS post-concussion: “resilient” (70%); “recovering” (25%), in which children experienced elevated acute symptoms that declined over time; and “chronic symptomatology” (5%). Due to small size, the chronic group should be interpreted with caution. Higher acute PCS and prior diagnosis of depression or anxiety both significantly increased predicted probability of recovering trajectory group membership. These findings establish that most children are resilient to PTSS following concussion, but that PTSS do occur acutely in a substantial minority of children. The study indicates mental health factors, particularly PTSS, depression, and anxiety, should be considered integral to models of concussion management and treatment.",0.699237291

People are not equally vulnerable to the adversity, experiencing varied patterns of long-term health trajectories in recovery depending on their vulnerabilities, capacities, and resiliencies. This study aims to identify latent mental and physical health trajectories and their associations with person- and place-based pre-disaster predictors. Using an Australian, population-based, longitudinal dataset spanning 2009-19, group-based multi-trajectory modelling was applied to identify the distinct mental, social, emotional, and physical health trajectories of people who had experienced damage to their home following a climate-related disaster event. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess a series of social vulnerability predictors (demographic, socioeconomic, housing, health, neighbourhood, and geographical) of health patterns. We identified three distinct health trajectories. Most individuals experienced small or minimal health impacts at the time of the disaster year followed by a fast recovery. However, one-fifth of the exposed population were severely affected during and post disaster. This cohort had the worst mental and physical health prior to the disaster and experienced the largest decreases in mental and physical health and the lowest recoveries. Pre-existing mental and physical conditions were the most substantial risk factors, increasing the probability of experiencing high impact and slow recovery by 61% for mental health and 51% for physical health. In addition, vulnerability in the form of housing affordability stress, lower household income, and lack of community attachment, participation and safety were also significant independent risk factors for ongoing post-disaster health problems. Critically, people's mental and physical health recovery is dependent on pre-disaster vulnerabilities in health, resource access, and capacities. These findings could assist policymakers and health practitioners to more effectively target people most at risk and design prevention and response strategies to prevent the exacerbation of poor health and wellbeing.",0.69915076

Repeated measures were of depressive symptoms on the modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and composite scores in the cognitive domains of attention, executive function, memory, language, and visuospatial function. Latent class trajectories were identified for depression and for each cognitive domain and their associations investigated using dual trajectory modeling. Cognitive trajectories with z scores below -1 were designated as persistently low.Five depressive symptom trajectories were observed: rarely depressed (60.5%); low-grade, decreasing symptoms (18.5%); low-grade, increasing symptoms (9.6%); moderate-grade symptoms (7.4%); and consistent higher-grade symptoms (4.0%). For each cognitive domain six trajectories were observed. The rarely depressed and low-grade decreasing symptom groups were the least likely to have persistently low cognition. The symptom trajectory most strongly associated with persistently low functioning in each domain was not the higher-grade group but rather the low-grade increasing group in the case of attention and the moderate-grade trajectory in the other four domains.Consistently higher-grade depressive symptoms are less strongly associated with poor cognitive functioning than with either moderate- or low-grade increasing depressive symptom trajectories, over time and across different domains. Examining both depression and cognition longitudinally allows heterogeneity of both to be addressed, revealing latent groups with potential diagnostic and prognostic implications.",0.698973918

Multi-group growth mixture modelling (MGMM) was used on a sample of 4983 children from the Longitudinal Study of Australia Children (LSAC). Depressive symptoms of these children were assessed over 10-years with six time-points, administered every second year commencing at 4 years via the parent report version of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Predictors of class membership were also examined. Four trajectories were found to be the best fitting model characterising low-stable (75%); decreasing (11%); increasing (9%); high and rising (6%) groups. Females were more likely to be in a trajectory of increasing depressive symptoms between 4 and 14 years of age than males. Reactive temperament and maternal depression at four and six years of age were consistent predictors of increasing and high trajectories while persistent temperament acts as a protective factor for females. The findings should be interpreted in the light of limitations due to common-method variance and the absence of diagnostic indicators of depressive disorder. We conclude that there are gender differences in patterns of depressive symptoms from childhood to adolescence and meaningful predictors of these early developmental trajectories. Preventative interventions in childhood targeting parents with depression and children with temperamental difficulties may be indicated.",0.698454921

Methods Using longitudinal depressive symptom data (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) from control participants in the Centering Pregnancy Plus Project (2008–2012), we conducted group-based trajectory modeling to identify depressive symptomatology trajectories from early pregnancy to 1-year postpartum among 623 adolescent women in New York City. We examined associations between sociodemographic, psychosocial, and pregnancy characteristics and the outcome, depressive symptom trajectories. Results We identified three distinct trajectory patterns: stable low or no depressive symptoms (58%), moderate depressive symptoms declining over time (32%), and chronically high depressive symptoms (11%). Women with chronically high symptoms reported higher levels of pregnancy distress and social conflict and lower perceived quality of social support than other women. Conclusions This study found heterogeneity in perinatal depressive symptom trajectories and identified a group with chronically high symptoms that might be detected during prenatal care. Importantly, we did not identify a trajectory group with new-onset high depressive symptoms postpartum. Findings have important implications for screening and early treatment.",0.698449568

However, little research to date has examined how benefit finding develops in the context of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). The present study aimed to identify trajectories of benefit finding across adolescence and to investigate prospective associations with depressive symptoms, self-care, and metabolic control.Adolescents with T1D aged 10 to 14 (Mage = 12.49 years, 54% girls) participated in a 4-wave longitudinal study spanning 1.5 years (N = 252 at Time 1). Adolescents filled out questionnaires on benefit finding, self-care, depressive symptoms, and illness perceptions. HbA1c values were obtained through point of care assays. We used latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) and latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to examine the development of benefit finding. Cross-lagged path analysis and multi-group LGCM were used to examine prospective associations among the study variables.Adolescents reported moderate levels of benefit finding which decreased over time. Three benefit finding trajectory classes were identified: low and decreasing, moderate and decreasing, and high and stable. These trajectory classes differed in terms of self-care, perceived personal and treatment control, and perceptions of illness cyclicality. Higher levels of benefit finding predicted relative increases in self-care 6 months later. Benefit finding was not prospectively related to depressive symptoms and metabolic control.Benefit finding may serve as a protective factor for adolescents with Type 1 diabetes and may motivate these adolescents to more closely follow their treatment regimen.

Existing studies may also miss short-term heterogeneity in depressive symptoms during the immediate postloss period due to lengthy delays in the first postloss assessment. Purpose This secondary-analysis study examined distinct depressive-symptom trajectories for caregivers of advanced cancer patients from EOL caregiving through the first 2 bereavement years with closely spaced assessments. Methods Depressive symptoms were measured monthly during EOL caregiving and 1, 3, 6, 13, 18, and 24 months postloss among 661 caregivers using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale. Depressive-symptom trajectories were identified using latent-class growth analysis while controlling for gender and age. Results We identified seven distinct depressive-symptom trajectories (prevalence) characterized by the timing, intensity, and duration of depressive symptoms: minimal-impact resilience (20.4%), recovery (34.0%), preloss-grief only (21.6%), delayed symptomatic (9.1%), relief (5.9%), prolonged symptomatic (6.5%), and chronically persistent distressed (2.5%). Conclusion Caregivers of advanced cancer patients responded heterogeneously to the stresses of EOL caregiving and bereavement. The majority of caregivers was resilient while providing caregiving and quickly rebounded to healthy levels of psychological functioning during bereavement, whereas a minority experienced delayed-symptomatic, prolonged-symptomatic, or chronically-persistent-distressing depressive-symptom trajectories. Linking caregivers’ psychological experiences from caregiving through bereavement by closely spaced assessments can more comprehensively illustrate their depressive-symptom trajectories, which confirm both the wear-and-tear and relief hypotheses, and help in targeting interventions for distinct depressive-symptom trajectories.",0.698161494

We modelled latent longitudinal recreational exercise trajectories spanning 8 years from age 16 to 24, and examined demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural, academic, and psychological predictors at age 15 of trajectory-group membership. We also explored whether trajectories were associated with health, mental health, and educational achievement at age 25. Finite mixture modelling was conducted with population-based longitudinal cohort study data collected from 2006-2017 by the Longitudinal Survey of Australian Youth (LSAY). The study sample comprised 9,353 students (49% female) from 356 Australian schools. Self-reported recreational exercise frequency data were collected in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2014. Longitudinal latent trajectories of reported recreational exercise participation were estimated using group-based trajectory modelling for two scenarios: daily/guideline-adherent exercise versus non-daily exercise (model 1) and exercise at least once weekly versus exercise less than once weekly (model 2). Four distinct classes of long-term recreational exercise participation were identified for each model. Model 1: guideline-adherent exercisers (17.9% of the sample), never guideline exercisers (27.5%), guideline drop-outs (15.2%) and towards guideline (39.4%). Model 2: regular weekly (69.5% of the sample), decreasing (17.4%), increasing (4.8%), and infrequent (8.3%). In both models, predictors at age 15 for lower long-term exercise participation included female gender, lower self-efficacy, sport participation and parental socioeconomic status, and higher screen-time and academic literacy. At age 25, people in the guideline-adherent exerciser trajectory (model 1) reported better general health, whereas people in the regular weekly trajectory (model 2) had better general health and reduced rates of psychological distress, were happier with life and were more optimistic for the future relative to participants from other trajectory groups. Interventions and health-promotion activities to support sustained engagement in recreational exercise should particularly address the needs of females, people with low self-efficacy, reluctant exercisers, higher academic achievers, and youth experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage.",0.697973954

The aim of this army veterans study was to examine whether pre-deployment cognitive ability is associated with the risk of developing PTSD symptoms or non-resilient PTSD trajectories. Follow up study in 428 Danish soldiers, deployed to Afghanistan in 2009, who were assessed at six occasions from pre-deployment to three years post-deployment. Pre-deployment vulnerabilities, deployment and homecoming stressors were measured. Pre-deployment cognitive test scores on Børge Priens Prøve (based on logical, verbal, numerical and spatial reasoning) were converted to a mean of 100 and with a standard deviation of 15. Higher pre-deployment cognitive ability scores were associated with lower risk of PTSD symptoms as assessed by the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist–Civilian Version (PCL-C) 2.5 years post-deployment (OR=0.97; 95% CI 0.95–1.00) after adjustment for educational length, baseline PCL-C score and perceived war-zone stress. Compared to a resilient trajectory, a non-resilient relieved-worsening trajectory (high baseline mental symptoms, being symptom free during deployment and a drastic increase in PTSD symptoms at the final assessments of PTSD symptoms) had significantly lower cognitive scores by a mean difference of 14.5 (95% CI 4.7–24.3). This trajectory (n=9) comprised 26.5% of soldiers with moderate-severe PTSD symptoms 2.5 years post-deployment. We confirmed an inverse association between pre-deployment cognitive ability and risk of PTSD symptoms, and observed significantly lower mean pre-deployment cognitive scores in one non-resilient PTSD trajectory. If replicated, this might inform relevant prevention efforts for soldiers at pre-deployment.",0.697965283

A total of 373 participants in the OPUS trial were included in the study. Symptoms were assessed at baseline and after 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 years using the Scales for the Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms. We used latent class growth mixture modelling to identify trajectories, and multinominal regression analyses to investigate predictors of membership to identified trajectories. Five trajectories of positive symptoms were identified: early continuous remission (50.9% of the sample), stable improvement (18.0%), intermittent symptoms (10.2%), relapse with moderate symptoms (11.9%), and continuous severe symptoms (9.1%). Substance use disorder (odds ratio, OR: 2.83, 95% CI: 1.09‐7.38, p=0.033), longer duration of untreated psychosis (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00‐1.03, p=0.007) and higher level of negative symptoms (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.07‐2.39, p=0.021) were predictors of the relapse with moderate symptoms trajectory, while only longer duration of untreated psychosis (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00‐1.02, p=0.030) predicted membership to the continuous severe symptoms trajectory. Two trajectories of negative symptoms were identified: symptom remission (51.0%) and continuous symptoms (49.0%). Predictors of the continuous symptoms trajectory were male sex (OR: 3.03, 95% CI: 1.48‐6.02, p=0.002) and longer duration of untreated psychosis (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00‐1.02, p=0.034). Trajectories displaying continuous positive and negative symptoms were linked to lower neurocognition, as measured by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) (z‐score: –0.78, CI: –1.39 to –0.17, for continuous positive symptoms; z‐score: –0.33, CI: –0.53 to –0.13, for continuous negative symptoms). The same trajectories were also linked to higher use of antipsychotic medication at 20‐year follow‐up (continuous positive symptoms: 78%; continuous negative symptoms: 67%). These findings suggest that the majority of patients with first‐episode schizophrenia spectrum disorder have a trajectory with early stable remission of positive symptoms. Long duration of untreated psychosis and comorbid substance abuse are modifiable predictors of poor trajectories for positive symptoms in these patients. In about half of patients, negative symptoms do not improve over time. These symptoms, in addition to being associated with poor social and neurocognitive functioning, may prevent patients from seeking help.",0.697419407

At 6-, 18-, and 30-months postearthquake, we followed a sample of 1,573 adolescents. Self-report measures were used to assess earthquake exposure, postearthquake negative life events, prosocial behavior, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, social support, and coping style. Data were analyzed using growth mixture modeling and multinomial logistic regressions. Four trajectories of postearthquake prosocial behavior were identified in the sample: (a) high/enhancing (35.0%), (b) high/stable (29.4%), (c) low/declining (33.6%), and (d) low/steeply declining (2.0%). Female gender, more social support, and greater positive coping were significant factors related to a higher probability of developing the high/enhancing trajectory. These findings may be helpful for us to identify adolescents with poor prosocial behavior after exposure to earthquakes so as to provide them with appropriate intervention.",0.697378474

  Impacted by Disasters","The return of normalcy to the population's lifestyle is a critical recovery milestone in the aftermath of disasters, and delayed lifestyle recovery could lead to significant well-being impacts. Lifestyle recovery captures the collective effects of population activities and the restoration of infrastructure and business services. This study uses a novel approach to leverage privacy-enhanced location intelligence data to characterize distinctive lifestyle patterns and to unveil recovery trajectories after a disaster in the context of 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. The analysis integrates multiple data sources to record the number of visits from home census block groups (CBGs) to different points of interest during the baseline period and disruptive period. First, primary clustering using k-means characterized four distinct essential and non-essential lifestyle patterns. Then, secondary clustering characterized the impact of the hurricane into three recovery trajectories based on the severity of maximum disruption and duration of recovery. The results reveal multiple recovery trajectories and durations within each lifestyle cluster, which imply differential recovery rates among similar lifestyle and demographic groups. The findings offer a twofold theoretical significance: (1) lifestyle recovery is a critical milestone that needs to be examined, quantified, and monitored in the aftermath of disasters; (2) the spatial structures of cities formed by human mobility and distribution of facilities and extends the spatial reach of flood impacts on population lifestyles. The analysis and findings also provide novel data-driven insights for public official and emergency managers to examine, measure, and monitor a critical milestone in community recovery trajectory based on the return of lifestyles to normalcy.",0.697049802

Depression after TBI has been correlated with decreased quality of life, poorer community re-integration, and lowered rates of return to productivity. While the persistence and impact of depressive symptoms have been well-documented in patients with moderate-severe TBI, less is known about the course of depression from the sub-acute to chronic stages of injury. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the trajectories of depressive symptoms from the sub-acute to the chronic stages of moderate to severe TBI and factors that may play a role in the onset and persistence of depression post-injury. Trajectory analysis revealed 4 distinct trajectory classes of depressive symptoms post-injury and multinomial logistic regression did not identify any significant predictive demographic or medical factors of class membership.

After testing the unconditional model, three predictors were added: first-time offender versus recidivist, age, and treatment duration. Postanalyses were chi-square difference tests, t tests, and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to assess differences in trajectories. Overall, on scale level, a decrease of risk factors over time was found. The predictors showed no significant slope differences although age and treatment duration differed significantly at some time points. The oldest age group performed worse, especially at later time points. Treatment duration effects were found at the second time point. Our results that forensic patients show a decrease in crime-related risk factors may indicate that treatment is effective.

The symptom trajectories and alliance patterns both independently and interactively predicted treatment outcomes. The optimal alliance was generally associated with the best outcome. The effect of improved alliance on treatment outcome was moderated by symptom trajectories: for high symptom/steady change subgroup, the improved alliance was related to better treatment outcome, whereas for early improving subgroup, the improved alliance was associated with poorer outcome.Patients fell into different trajectories regarding symptom reduction and alliance development in early psychotherapy that affected final treatment outcome.

This study aims to evaluate the trajectory of functional outcome and health status up to five years after moderate to major trauma in Hong Kong. Methods We report the five year follow up results of a multicentre, prospective cohort from the trauma registries of three regional trauma centres in Hong Kong. The original cohort recruited 400 adult trauma patients with ISS ≥ 9. Telephone follow up was conducted longitudinally at seven time points, and the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) and Short-Form 36 (SF36) were tracked. Results 119 out of 309 surviving patients (39%) completed follow up after 5 years. The trajectory of GOSE, PCS and MCS showed gradual improvements over the seven time points. 56/119 (47.1%) patients reported a GOSE = 8 (upper good recovery), and the mean PCS and MCS was 47.8 (95% CI 45.8, 49.9) and 55.8 (95% CI 54.1, 57.5) respectively at five years. Univariate logistic regression showed change in PCS - baseline to 1 year and 1 year to 2 years, and change in MCS - baseline to 1 year were associated with GOSE = 8 at 5 years. Linear mixed effects model showed differences in PCS and MCS were greatest between 1-month and 6-month follow up.

Here, we empirically identify subgroups with distinct trajectories of depressive symptom change among adolescents enrolled in two indicated depression prevention trials and examine how cognitive-behavioral (CB) interventions and baseline predictors relate to trajectory membership.Six hundred thirty-one participants were assigned to one of three conditions: CB group intervention, CB bibliotherapy, and brochure control. We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms from pretest to 2-year follow-up. We examined associations between class membership and conditions using chi-square tests and baseline predictors using multinomial regressions.We identified four trajectories in the full sample. Qualitatively similar trajectories were found in each condition separately. Two trajectories of positive symptom course (low-declining, high-declining) had declining symptoms and were distinguished by baseline symptom severity. Two trajectories of negative course (high-persistent, resurging), respectively, showed no decline in symptoms or decline followed by symptom reappearance. Participants in the brochure control condition were significantly more likely to populate the high-persistent trajectory relative to either CB condition and were significantly less likely to populate the low-declining trajectory relative to CB group. Several baseline factors predicted trajectory classes, but gender was the most informative prognostic factor, with males having increased odds of membership in a high-persistent trajectory relative to other trajectories.Findings suggest that CB preventive interventions do not alter the nature of trajectories, but reduce the risk that adolescents follow a trajectory of chronically elevated symptoms.",0.696064666

The study examined the mental health trajectories of a sample of employed adults in Hamilton, Ontario during the initial lockdown and after the re-opening following the first wave in Canada. Further, this study also identified the pandemic-related stressors and coping strategies associated with changes in depressive symptoms in employed adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The InHamilton COVID-19 longitudinal study involved 579 employees aged 22–88 years from a large public university in an urban area of Hamilton, Ontario at baseline (April 2020). Participants were followed monthly with 6 waves of data collected between April and November 2020. A growth mixture modeling approach was used to identify distinct groups of adults who followed a similar pattern of depressive symptoms over time and to describe the longitudinal change in the outcome within and among the identified sub-groups. Results Our results showed two distinct trajectories of change with 66.2% of participants displaying low-consistent patterns of depressive symptoms, and 33.8% of participants displaying high-increasing depressive symptom patterns. COVID-19 pandemic-related experiences including health concerns, caregiving burden, and lack of access to resources were associated with worsening of the depressive symptom trajectories. Frequent use of dysfunctional coping strategies and less frequent use of emotion-focused coping strategies were associated with the high and increasing depressive symptom pattern. Conclusions The negative mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are specific to subgroups within the population and stressors may persist and worsen over time.

Latent transition analysis of pain Numeric Rating Scale, SF-12, and EQ-5D-3L pain and mental health items from 6 to 12 months, and 12 to 24 months post-injury were used to identify symptom transitions.Four transition groups were identified: transition to low problems by 12-months; transition to low problems at 24-months; stable low problems; and no transition from problems. Group-based trajectory modelling of pain and mental health treatments found three treatment trajectories: low/no treatment, a moderate treatment that declined to low treatment 3-12 months post-injury, and increasing treatment over time. Predictors of pain and mental health recovery transitions, identified using multinomial logistic regression, were primarily found to be non-modifiable socioeconomic and health-related characteristics (e.g., higher education, working pre-injury, and not having comorbidities), and low treatment trajectories.Targeted and collaborative rehabilitation should be considered for people at risk of persistent pain or mental health symptoms to optimise their recovery, particularly patients with socioeconomic disadvantage.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTwo-thirds of people experience pain and/or mental health within the first 24-months after hospitalization for road trauma, of whom only 6-7% recover by 12-months, and a further 6% recover by 24-months post-injury.There were three main trajectories of administrative records of treatments received in the first two years after injury: 76 and 83% had low treatment, 18 and 12% had moderate then declining treatment levels, and 6 and 5% had stable high treatment for pain or mental health, respectively.People who recovered from pain or mental health symptoms generally had lower treatment and higher socioeconomic position, highlighting that coordinated rehabilitation care should be prioritized for people living with socioeconomic disadvantage.",0.696006086

We used data from the Behavior Outlook Norwegian Developmental Study (BONDS), comprising 1,159 children (559 girls). Parents reported on risk and protective factors, and on physical aggression from 1 to 5 years; teachers reported on Grade 2 outcomes. We employed latent class growth curve analyses to identify nine aggression trajectories. In fully adjusted models testing simultaneously all associations among predictors, trajectories, and outcomes, maternal and paternal harsh parenting, child gender, and sibling presence predicted trajectory membership, which significantly predicted Grade 2 externalizing. Child gender had a pervasive influence on all outcomes as well as on trajectory membership. This is the first trajectory study that attempts to sort out which predictors are most proximal, more distal, or just confounded, with their relative direct effect sizes, and to link early paternal as well as maternal harsh parenting with children’s development of physical aggression from infancy to preschool age.

We applied growth mixture models to the same longitudinal data set that has previously been used to assert that resilience is ubiquitous. When using identical model specifications, as in prior studies, we found that resilient trajectories were most common, but the number of trajectories identified was different. When we relaxed two assumptions used in prior studies-that (a) all classes have similar variability in levels of postadversity adjustment and (b) there is no variability in changes within classes-we found that a resilience class was least common. Methodologically, our results show how findings on trajectories of change following major life stressors can vary substantially, depending on statistical model specifications. Conceptually, the results underscore the errors inherent in any categorical statements about ""rates of resilience"" among individuals confronted with major life stressors. Pragmatically, they underscore the dangers in recommending against prophylactic interventions (on the basis of one method of analyzing longitudinal data) for individuals who have experienced major life stressors.",0.695704943

While evidence suggests that childhood is generally a period of emotion regulation growth and development, research is needed to examine factors that may contribute to deviations from a typical trajectory. In a prospective study of 1,905 children, latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to identify trajectory groups of emotion regulation across toddlerhood (age 14-36 months), examine predictors of those trajectory groups from child temperament, parenting behaviors, and environmental risk, and explore predictions of resilience in 5th grade from the identified groups. LGCA supported a three-class model, with a Stable Incline group, a Decline group, and a Catch-Up group. Child negative emotionality, positive and negative parenting, and environmental risk predicted group membership. These trajectory groups in toddlerhood were predictive of child resilient functioning in the 5th grade. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing developmental models of emotion regulation and provide implications for prevention and early intervention services to enhance emotion regulation development in early childhood.La regulación de la emoción es crítica para el funcionamiento óptimo a lo largo de una amplia gama de dominios, y pudiera ser aún más importante para individuos en ambientes de alto riesgo. Aunque la evidencia sugiere que la niñez es generalmente un período de crecimiento y desarrollo de la regulación emocional, se necesita investigación para examinar los factores que pudieran contribuir a las desviaciones de esta trayectoria. En un estudio de probabilidad de 1,905 niños, se usó un análisis de crecimiento de clase latente (LCGA) para identificar grupos de trayectoria de la regulación emocional a lo largo de la primera infancia (edad 14-36 meses), examinar los factores de predicción de esos grupos de trayectoria como el temperamento del niño, conductas de crianza, y riesgo del ambiente, y explorar las predicciones de resistencia de los grupos en el quinto grado. LCGA apoyó un modelo de tres clases, con un grupo inclinado a la estabilidad, un grupo que disminuye, y un grupo que trata de alcanzar. La emocionalidad negativa del niño, la crianza positiva y negativa, así como el riesgo del ambiente predijeron la pertenencia al grupo. Estos grupos de trayectoria en la primera infancia predijeron el funcionamiento de la resistencia en el quinto grado.

Es gibt viele Anhaltspunkte dafür gibt, dass die Kindheit im Allgemeinen eine Phase des Wachstums und der Entwicklung der Emotionsregulation ist. Trotzdem gibt es einen Bedarf an Studien, die Faktoren untersuchen, welche zu einer negativen Entwicklung der Emotionsregulation beitragen. In einer prospektiven Studie an 1.905 Kindern wurde eine Analyse des latenten Klassenwachstums (latent class growth analysis; LCGA) verwendet, um Verlaufsgruppengruppen hinsichtlich der Emotionsregulation im Kleinkindalter (Alter 14-36 Monate) zu identifizieren. Außerdem wurden anhand des kindlichen Temperaments, des Elternverhaltens und des Umweltrisikos Prädiktoren dieser Verlaufsgruppengruppen untersucht und später, in der 5.

Describing the variability of symptom change trajectories is useful to better predict long-term status and to improve interventions. Outcome data (N_complete = 518, 4 time points, 1 year of observation time) from a large naturalistic multi-center study on the effects of inpatient and day hospital treatment of unipolar depression were used to identify clusters of symptom trajectories. Common outcome classifications and statistical methods of longitudinal cluster analysis were applied. However, common outcome classifications (in terms of e.g. remission, relapse or recurrence) were not exhaustive, as 49.3% of the trajectories could not be allocated to its classes. Longitudinal cluster analysis reveals 7 clusters (fast response, slow response, retarded response, temporary or persistent relapse, recurrence, and nonresponse). Nonresponse at the end of treatment was a predictor of poor outcome at long term follow up. The classification of patterns of symptom change in depression should be extended. Longitudinal cluster analysis seems a valid option to analyze outcome trajectories over time if a limited number of time points of measurement are available.",0.694638955

Harmful drinking, depression, psychological distress, disability, episodic memory and working memory did not improve significantly over the 2 years following injury. For other measures, including the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms and Quality of Life after Brain Injury (QOLIBRI), LGC analysis revealed significant improvement over time with recovery tending to plateau at 3-6 months.Significant impairment may persist as late as 2 years after mTBI despite some recovery over time. Longitudinal analyses which make use of all available data indicate that recovery from mTBI occurs over a longer timescale than is commonly believed. These findings point to the need for long-term management of mTBI targeting individuals with persisting impairment.",0.694616742

To address this goal, each year, as students (N = 291) progressed from kindergarten to second grade, we assessed teachers’ reports on student-teacher-relationship closeness and conflict. We assessed achievement in second grade. We used latent class growth analyses to identify separate distinct trajectory classes of change for boys and girls in closeness and conflict. Boys were classified into 4 classes (stable-moderate, high-decreasing, decreasers, or increasers) for closeness and into 4 similar classes for conflict. Girls were classified into 3 classes (stable-high, decreasers, and increasers) for closeness, whereas only 2 classes (stable-low and decreasers) emerged for conflict. In general, girls benefited academically from a close student-teacher relationship in kindergarten, whereas boys benefited academically when they moved into a close, and away from a conflictual, relationship across kindergarten to second grade. The findings have implications for teacher trainings and programs designed to help children succeed in school.",0.694562385

Few studies have compared trajectories of depression and anxiety among clinically ill. We aimed to identify specific trajectories of depression, and anxiety and predictors of trajectory membership. Latent growth mixture modelling was carried out on data from the IPS-MA trial (n = 261), a supported employment intervention for people with mood or anxiety, to identify trajectories of depression and anxiety. Logistic regression was used to estimate predictors for trajectory membership. Associations between trajectory class and remission of comorbid depression or anxiety and return to work were also tested. We identified three trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms respectively; moderate-decreasing (60%), moderate-stable (26%), and low-stable (14%) depression and mild-decreasing (59%), moderate-decreasing (33%), and moderate-stable (8%) anxiety. The depression model showed low precision in class separation (entropy 0.66), hence, predictors of class membership were not estimated. For anxiety, lower age and higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with a less desirable trajectory. Remission of comorbid depressive symptoms after two years differed significantly between classes (p < 0.000). Fewer had returned to work in the two moderate classes compared to the mild-decreasing anxiety class. Depression model not reliable. Only 80% of participants from original study included. Not able to distinguish between anxiety disorders. Trajectories of anxiety confirm that, even after two years, a rather large proportion in the moderate-stable class had symptoms of moderate anxiety, moderate comorbid depressive symptoms, and less probability of having returned to work.

Study goals were to characterize patterns and predictors of depressive symptoms and major depressive episodes in recently diagnosed breast cancer patients. Consecutively recruited women (N = 460) completed a validated interview (CIDI) and questionnaire measure (CES-D) of depression within 4 months after invasive breast cancer diagnosis and at six additional assessments across 12 months. Outcomes were major depressive episodes, continuous symptom scores, and latent symptom trajectory classes. Across 12 months, 16.6 % of women met criteria for a major depressive episode. Unemployment predicted depressive episodes after other correlates were controlled. Distinct trajectory classes were apparent: an estimated 38 % of women had chronically elevated symptoms (High trajectory), 20 % recovered from elevated symptoms (Recovery), and 43 % had lower symptoms (Low and Very Low trajectories). Although 96 % of episodes occurred in the High or Recovery classes, 66 % of women in the High trajectory did not have an episode. Women in the Low (vs High) trajectory were more likely to be older, retired, more affluent, and have fewer comorbid diseases and briefer oncologic treatment. Women in the Recovery trajectory (vs High) were more likely to be married and more affluent and have fewer comorbid diseases. Assuming available therapeutic resources, assessment of both depressive symptoms and episodes over several months after diagnosis is important. Identification of patients at risk for persistently high depressive symptoms (e.g., younger, longer treatment course) opens targeted opportunities to prevent and promote rapid recovery from depression.",0.69414635

Previous research suggests that children exposed to traumatic events experience heightened fear, anxiety, and feelings of vulnerability, but little research has examined potential aggressive and disruptive behavioral reactions. Utilizing a longitudinal dataset in which a local school shooting occurred during the course of data collection, this study sought to investigate whether the trajectory of disruptive behaviors was affected by the shooting. A two‐piece growth curve model was used to examine the trajectory of disruptive behaviors during the pre‐shooting years (i.e., piece one) and post‐shooting years (i.e., piece two). Results indicated that the two‐piece growth curve model fit the data better than the one‐piece model and that the school shooting precipitated a faster decline in aggressive behaviors. This study demonstrated a novel approach to examining effects of an unexpected traumatic event on behavioral trajectories using an existing longitudinal data set.",0.694102926

While children have demonstrated consistent trajectories for various types of mental health problems, the existence of developmental trajectories of overall risk of mental health problems has not been explored. This study aimed to identify distinct trajectories of overall mental health risk among children from ages 4–12 years. A secondary objective was to identify predictors of the mental health risk trajectories. Method Data from the first five waves of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children ( LSAC ) were used to assess mental health risk and potential predictors. The primary parent ( n = 3717) completed questionnaires, time‐use diaries, and face‐to‐face interviews over the five waves. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify distinct latent trajectories of mental health risk. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify predictors of the trajectories. Results Six distinct trajectories of mental health risk were identified: Low Difficulty (72.9%), Improvers (9.7%), Decliners (7.9%), Early Decliners/Late Improvers (4.7%), Early Improvers/Late Decliners (2.7%), and High Difficulty (2.2%). Child sex, sociability, parental warmth, sports participation, and household income were identified as significant predictors of mental health trajectories. Conclusions There are distinct trajectories of overall risk for mental health problems during childhood. Research should focus on the High Difficulties group and the Early Improvers/Late Decliners group to address the predictors and improve access to early mental health services.",0.693780437

The aim of this study was to examine the developmental trajectories and predictors of general psychological distress in three samples of Bosnian war survivors over an 11-year period. In 1998/99, about three years after the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a representative sample of 299 adult Sarajevo citizens was examined in three subsamples: individuals who had stayed in Sarajevo throughout the siege, individuals who had been internally displaced, and refugees who had returned. Of the 138 study participants who could be located 11 years later, 100 were re-assessed (71%) using the Brief Symptom Inventory. Over time, psychological symptoms and general psychological distress decreased in those survivors who had stayed and increased in returnees. Former displaced persons did not show any significant changes. After controlling for other factors, cumulative trauma exposure before and during the war predicted general psychological distress at baseline. Eleven years later, higher trauma exposure during and after the war, returnee status, and more current stressors were all associated with higher levels of general psychological distress. Levels of psychological symptoms remained high in three subsamples of Bosnian war survivors. The differential symptom trajectories may correspond to distinct war experiences and contemporary stressors. Still, the cumulative effect of war traumata on mental distress persisted more than a decade after war and displacement, although the influence of current stressors seemed to increase over time.",0.693709917

However, longitudinal data on the direction of this association and the stability of perceived social support are scarce and have yielded mixed results, with a particular lack of prospective studies. We aimed to investigate changes in perceived social support and bidirectional associations between perceived social support and psychological symptoms in a prospective, longitudinal study. Methods A sample of German soldiers was assessed before and after deployment to Afghanistan. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to investigate the stability of perceived social support and to identify possible distinguishable trajectories of perceived social support. Bidirectional associations between perceived social support (general and workplace) and psychological symptoms (depressive, anxiety and PTS) were examined using gamma regressions. Results Average levels of perceived general social support did not change, while perceived workplace social support increased slightly (t(344) = 5.51, p &lt; .001). There were no distinguishable trajectories of perceived social support. Higher perceived general (Mean ratio ( MR) = 0.84, 95% CI = [0.74, 0.95]) and workplace social support ( MR = 0.82, 95% CI = [0.72, 0.92]) predicted lower depressive symptoms, but not anxiety or PTS symptoms. Only higher PTS ( MR = 0.95, 95% CI = [0.91, 0.99]) and higher depressive symptoms ( MR = 0.96, 95% CI = [0.93, 0.99]) predicted lower perceived general social support. Conclusions Perceived social support can remain relatively stable under exposure to environmental stressors such as military deployment. Higher perceived social support could protect against depressive symptoms via a stress-buffering mechanism, while support may need to be more tailored to individual needs for a protection against PTS symptoms. Individuals with elevated depressive and PTS symptoms might have impaired abilities or opportunities to access social support after stressful event exposure. Future studies could investigate distressing social emotions and associated maladaptive social cognitions as possible mechanisms in the association between symptoms and lower perceived social support. Especially with respect to PTS symptoms, future studies could focus on conditions that enable individuals to benefit from social support.",0.693654901
https://openalex.org/W2942111137,10.1037/ort0000418,The influence of flood exposure and subsequent stressors on youth social-emotional health.,"Most disaster mental health research focuses on the relationship between disaster exposure and distress, often neglecting its influence on social-emotional health, despite implications for resilience and well-being after the disaster. Following multiple floods in Texas, a sample of 486 youth aged 10-19 years old (M = 13.74 years, SD = 2.57; 52.9% male) completed measures of disaster exposure, life stressors since the disaster, and social-emotional health. Using mixture regression modeling, we examined differences in the relationship between life stressors and social-emotional health across latent classes of disaster exposure (high, moderate, community, and low exposure). After accounting for mean levels of life stressors, the mean levels of social-emotional health did not differ across exposure classes; however, the strength of the relationship between life stressors and social-emotional health did. Youth in the high exposure group had the highest mean level of life stressors since the disaster. Thus, each additional life stressor did not result in changes in social-emotional health, suggesting saturated stress levels. For youth in the moderate and community exposure classes, increases in life stressors did lower social-emotional health, perhaps pushing them into stress overload. For the low exposure group, life stressors did not have an influence. This has implications for postdisaster mental health screening and support, tailored by levels of exposure and attuned to ongoing stressors that may impact long-term social-emotional health.

Narrow-band measures of depression, anxiety, obsessions-compulsions, and conduct problems were assessed at six-time points, and bifactor analysis was performed to extract p factor scores. These scores were submitted to Latent Class Growth Analyses to identify patterns of change over time.Three different trajectories of change in p were identified. Two trajectories displayed reductions in p across time-points: one a rapid decrease, and the other slower but steady improvement. The third trajectory indicated a limited decrease in p up until the 12th week after baseline but no further improvement at subsequent time-points. Patients' baseline p significantly predicted their outcome trajectories.Exploring change in p seemed to describe more parsimoniously the patients' outcomes than the narrow-band assessment of depressive symptoms.

To date, cognitive symptoms trajectories in working cancer survivors and the factors associated with these trajectories have not been examined. Methods Data from a heterogeneous group of working cancer survivors ( n = 379) of the longitudinal “Work-Life-after-Cancer” study, linked with Netherlands Cancer Registry data, were used. The Cognitive Symptom Checklist-Work was administered at baseline (within the first 3 months after return to work), 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up to measure self-perceived memory and executive function symptoms. Data were analyzed using group-based trajectory modeling. Results Four trajectories of memory and executive function symptoms were identified. All memory symptoms trajectories were stable and labeled as “stable-high” (15.3% of the sample), “stable-moderately high” (39.6%), “stable-moderately low” (32.0%), and “stable-low” (13.0%). Executive function symptoms trajectories changed over time and were labeled as “increasing-high” (10.1%), “stable-moderately high” (32.0%), “decreasing-moderately low” (35.5%), and “stable-low” (22.4%). Higher symptoms trajectories were associated with older age, longer time from diagnosis to return to work, more quantitative work demands, and higher levels of depressive symptoms at baseline. Conclusions In cancer survivors who returned to work, four cognitive symptoms trajectory subgroups were identified, representing different but relatively stable severity levels of cognitive symptoms. Implications for Cancer Survivors To identify cancer survivors with higher symptoms trajectories, health care providers should assess cognitive symptoms at baseline after return to work. In case of cognitive symptoms, it is important to also screen for psychological factors to provide appropriate guidance.",0.692870616

Little is known about waterpipe (WP) smoking and developmental trajectories of ND criteria across adolescence.Here, we aimed to identify ND trajectories from early- to late-adolescence in current (past 30 days) WP smokers and examine baseline correlates of each identified trajectory, using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The analytical sample consisted of 278 current WP smokers from eight waves of an ongoing longitudinal cohort of eighth to ninth graders in Lebanon. Group-based trajectory modeling was estimated to identify trajectory classes for ICD-10-ND criteria over ages 11-18.A group-based modeling approach yielded a four-class solution that best fit the data and reflected differences in the timing of ND onset during adolescence: no-onset of ND (43.9%), early-onset (16.2%), mid-onset (26.6%), and late-onset (13.3%) of ND criteria. Having a less-educated mother (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.08, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.01% to 16.53%) and siblings who smoke WP (aOR = 3.95, 95% CI = 1.08% to 14.42%), exposure to favorite WP-specific advertisements (aOR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.03% to 10.85%), and being a novelty seeker (aOR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.02% to 1.23%) were associated with early-onset of ND. Daily (aOR = 3.48, 95% CI = 1.08% to 11.23%) or weekly (aOR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.05% to 4.62%) WP smokers (vs. monthly) and having higher stress level (aOR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.00% to 1.14%) were associated with mid-onset trajectory. Believing that WP smoking is not harmful to health (aOR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.02% to 0.82%) and spending less than 60 minutes on a WP smoking session (aOR = 5.62, 95% CI = 1.20% to 26.44%) were associated with late-onset ND trajectory class.Monitoring the development of ND trajectories among WP smokers may identify an individual as belonging to one of these four groups with distinct individual and socioenvironmental factors and allow the individual and health care providers opportunities to inform initiate on-time WP-specific tailored prevention and cessation interventions.The results from this study showed a four-class trajectory of ICD-10-ND criteria and suggested that every ND trajectory class during adolescence could have distinctive characteristics and therefore provides new insights into the process of ND in terms of when and what specific interventions are needed to curb the development of ND and long-term WP smoking among youth.",0.692632908

Methods Study participants comprised 2,016 community-dwelling Korean adults aged over 65 years, using data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) from 2006–2016. The KLoSA, a nationally representative panel survey, has been conducted biannually since 2006. We used latent class growth analysis to identify depressive symptom trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of each class of depressive symptoms. Results Five depressive symptom trajectory groups were identified: Class 1, no depressive symptom (13.8%); Class 2, low depressive symptom (32.8%); Class 3, decreasing depressive symptom (10.6%); Class 4, increasing depressive symptoms (24.0%); and Class 5, persistent depressive symptoms (18.8%). We found that older adults followed five distinct depressive symptom trajectories over 10 years. Mini-Mental State Examination scores, number of chronic diseases, educational level, gender, current employment, contact with children, and social activity were associated with a higher risk of these trajectories. Conclusions Depressive symptoms are associated with social networks as cognitive function scores increase and number of chronic diseases decrease. Interventions to strengthening existing social networks and developing relationships should be tailored to target specific needs for each trajectory, and chronic disease management, including cognitive function, may be beneficial in preventing depressive symptoms among older adults.

It is associated with increased risk of institutionalization and death, and it is of many patients considered among the worst symptoms to cope with after stroke. Longitudinal studies focusing on trajectories of fatigue may contribute to understanding patients’ experience of fatigue over time and its associated factors, yet only a few have been conducted to date. Objectives To explore whether subgroups of stroke survivors with distinct trajectories of fatigue in the first 18 months post stroke could be identified and whether these subgroups differ regarding sociodemographic, medical and/or symptom-related characteristics. Materials and methods 115 patients with first-ever stroke admitted to Oslo University Hospital or Buskerud Hospital were recruited and data was collected prospectively during the acute phase and at 6, 12 and 18 months post stroke. Data on fatigue (both pre- and post-stroke), sociodemographic, medical and symptom-related characteristics were collected through structured interviews, standardized questionnaires and from the patients’ medical records. Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to identify latent classes, i.e., subgroups of patients, based on their Fatigue Severity Scales (FSS) scores at the four time points. Differences in sociodemographic, medical, and symptom-related characteristics between the latent classes were evaluated using univariate and multivariable ordinal regression analyses. Results and their significance Using GMM, three latent classes of fatigue trajectories over 18 months were identified, characterized by differing levels of fatigue: low, moderate and high. The mean FSS score for each class remained relatively stable across all four time points. In the univariate analyses, age <75, pre-stroke fatigue, multiple comorbidities, current depression, disturbed sleep and some ADL impairment were associated with higher fatigue trajectories. In the multivariable analyses, pre-stroke fatigue (OR 4.92, 95% CI 1.84–13.2), multiple comorbidities (OR 4,52,95% CI 1.85–11.1) and not working (OR 4.61, 95% CI 1.36–15,7) were the strongest predictor of higher fatigue trajectories The findings of this study may be helpful for clinicians in identifying patients at risk of developing chronic fatigue after stroke.",0.692104043

Although latent class growth analyses (LCGA) have been used to explain course-heterogeneity, such analyses have failed to also account for symptom-heterogeneity of depressive symptoms. Therefore, the aim was to identify more specific data-driven subgroups based on patterns of course-trajectories on different depressive symptom domains. In primary care MDD patients (n=205), the presence of the MDD criterion symptoms was determined for each week during a year. Weekly ‘mood/cognition’ (MC) and ‘somatic’ (SOM) scores were computed and parallel processes-LCGA (PP-LCGA) was used to identify subgroups based on the course on these domains. The classes׳ associations with baseline predictors and 2-/3-year outcomes were investigated. PP-LCGA identified four classes: quick recovery, persisting SOM, persisting MC, and persisting SOM+MC (chronic). Persisting SOM was specifically predicted by higher baseline somatic symptomatology and somatization, and was associated with more somatic depressive symptomatology at long-term follow-up. Persisting MC was specifically predicted by higher depressive severity, thinking insufficiencies, neuroticism, loneliness and lower self-esteem, and was associated with lower mental health related quality of life and more mood/cognitive depressive symptomatology at follow-up. The sample was small and contained only primary care MDD patients. The weekly depression assessments were collected retrospectively at 3-month intervals. The results indicate that there are two specific prototypes of depression, characterized by either persisting MC or persisting SOM, which have different sets of associated prognostic factors and long-term outcomes, and could have different etiological mechanisms.",0.692049552

Participants were adolescents who were part of the large longitudinal panel study on Korean Youths, Korean Children & Youth Panel Survey 2010 (KCYPS 2010) of the National Youth Policy Institute (NYPI). Specifically, data were drawn from two cohorts of KCYPS that differed in participant age (Panel 1: 2003 birth cohort, n = 2,342, 48.2% girls; Panel 2: 2000 birth cohorts, n = 2,378, 40.0% girls). We analyzed data collected from 2010 to 2016 when children in panel 1 were 6-7 to 12-13 years old, and children in panel 2 were 9-10 to 15-16 years old. Results of latent growth modeling (LGM) were as follows. In Panel 1, the inattention symptoms increased from 9-10 to 12-13 years. Otherwise, the inattention symptoms decreased from 11-12 to 15-16 years in panel 2. Additionally, in both panels, initial status and slope of inattention significantly predicted later levels of depressive symptoms, and peer relationships partly mediated the association between inattention trajectory and depressive symptoms. The findings are discussed with respect to considering the growth of inattention and the quality of peer relationships as promising targets for early identification and intervention of depression in adolescents.",0.691781559

But in longitudinal research, using a single slope to describe the trajectory of adolescent self-esteem is unrealistic. The piecewise growth mixture model (PGMM) was used to fit the data in this study. Selecting from China Family Panel Studies database, a total of 1,759 individuals were selected and their self-esteem (RSES) scores over the years were used as the tracking index. Based on the characteristics of the development trajectories of three latent classes, class 1 was referred to as “stable low level group,” class 2 was named “rapidly rising group,” and class 3 was referred to as “rapidly decrease group.” And there were two stages in the development process of self-esteem in the adolescent group. The slope of the stable low level group showed a significant downward trend in the first stage and a significant upward trend in the second stage, with a relatively flat development trajectory and relatively low self-esteem on the whole. The slope of the rapidly rising group showed an insignificant upward trend in the first stage and a significant rapid upward trend in the second stage. The rapidly decrease group showed a significant and rapid downward trend in the first stage and a significant and rapid upward trend in the second stage. In the development of self-esteem in adolescence, there were three latent classes in which the characteristics of development trajectories were different. Age of 14 is the turning point between the two stages of development.",0.691729269

This prospective epidemiologic study evaluated the course of depression and factors associated with it among survivors 23-years post-earthquake. A geographically stratified subsample of 725 adults exposed to the Spitak earthquake was assessed for depression using DSM-III-R criteria in 1991 and 2012. Additionally, an adapted CES-D-16 scale was used to assess depressive symptoms in 2012. A fitted multi-nominal logistic regression model identified predictors of different trajectories of depression. For the whole group, the rate of clinical depression dropped from 51.5% in 1991 to 31.7% in 2012. Earthquake intensity and experiencing strong fear at baseline were strongly associated with chronic (depressed at both assessments, 18.1%) and recovered (depressed only in 1991, 33.5%) depression trajectories compared with the healthy group, with odds ratios (OR) over 4.0 and 3.0, respectively. Predictors distinguishing chronic depression included earthquake-related nuclear-family deaths (OR=3.79), chronic illnesses at baseline (OR=1.24), and social support (OR=0.91). Predictors of the late-onset trajectory (depressed only in 2012, 13.5% of the cohort) included post-earthquake trauma (OR=1.42), socioeconomic status (OR=0.45), and social support (OR=0.86).

To investigate post-consultation symptom trajectories in children with acute cough and RTI and whether baseline characteristics predict trajectory group. Prospective cohort study of 2296 children (3 months–16 years) whose parents were invited to report cough severity and duration using a 7-point Likert scale. Longitudinal latent class analysis (LLCA) was used to identify post-consultation symptom trajectories in the first 15 days, and multinomial models to predict class membership. Complete data were available for 1408 children (61%). The best LLCA model identified five post-consultation symptom trajectory groups: ‘very rapid recovery’ (28.5%), ‘rapid recovery’ (37.7%), ‘intermediate recovery’ (18.2%), ‘persistent symptoms’ (9.5%) and ‘initial deterioration with persistent symptoms’ (6.0%). Compared with very rapid recovery, parent-reported severe cough in the 24 hours prior to consultation increased the likelihood of rapid recovery (OR 1.79 [95% CI 1.23, 2.60]), intermediate recovery (OR 2.13 [1.38, 3.30] and initial deterioration with persistent symptoms (OR 2.29 [1.26, 4.16]). Initial deterioration was also associated with ‘severe barking cough’ (OR 3.64 [1.50, 8.82]), ‘severely reduced energy in the 24 hours prior to consultation’ (OR 3.80 [1.62, 8.87] and higher parent-assessed illness severity at consultation (OR 2.21 [1.17, 4.18]).

Innovations included monthly assessments, examination of non-linear trajectories, and inclusion of coping styles as predictors. Data were derived from a six-month longitudinal study of 144 community-dwelling older adults with depressive symptoms (Short-Geriatric Depression Scale [S-GDS]≥5) with seven waves of data. Descriptive analyses and individual growth curve modeling were conducted. The majority of participants changed symptom levels over time; most participants with severe symptoms at baseline remained at least mildly depressed at six months. Younger participants were more depressed at baseline and improved slightly more than older participants. Those who used more active and emotional support coping had faster improvement and maintained gains, whereas those who used less of these coping styles demonstrated worse symptoms over the six-month follow-up period. The most significant limitations are the convenience sampling methods and relatively small sample size, although the large number of assessments (7 waves) increases precision of the statistical methods used. Findings suggest that it may be beneficial to target interventions to older adults with more severe depressive symptoms and who display low levels of active and emotional support coping. Behavioral interventions that improve these coping styles may help depressed older adults recover and maintain treatment gains over time.",0.691179197

We investigated the association between family separation and psychological symptoms in refugees resettled in Australia from 2013 to 2016. Participants were 1,495 adult refugees ( M = 38.9 years, SD = 12.7) who participated in the Building a New Life in Australia population‐based study across 4 years. Participants were assessed for psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder–8 (PTSD‐8), respectively. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify latent longitudinal trajectories and binary logistic regression to assess the contribution of family predictor variables toward PTSD‐8 and K6 symptom trajectory class membership. The LCGA supported a four‐class solution for PTSS, categorized as improving PTSS (18.4%), persistently high PTSS (11.5%), resilient PTSS (57.3%), and deteriorating PTSS (12.6%). For the K6, LCGA supported a four‐class solution comprising classes categorized as persistently high psychological distress (PD; 7.0%), improving PD (17.3%), resilient PD (61.1%), and deteriorating PD (14.6%). Separation from family members did not independently predict the course of psychological symptoms; however, worry about family and friends contributed to the persistence of high PTSD‐8 scores, OR = 1.75, and deteriorating K6 scores, OR = 1.57. The current findings suggest persistently high or worsening psychological symptom trajectories during the postsettlement phase may be marked by worry about family and friends, in addition to older age and female gender, rather than separation alone.",0.690722525

Method: 206 children ages 3–7 years at injury were included: 87 TBI (23 severe, 21 moderate, 43 complicated mild) and 119 orthopedic injury (OI). We administered intelligence tests shortly after injury (1½ months), 12 months, and 6.8 years postinjury. Latent class growth modeling was used to identify latent subgroups. Separate models examined verbal and nonverbal IQ recovery trajectories following TBI versus OI. Variables included: age at injury, sex, race, socioeconomic status, injury severity, quality of the home environment, family functioning, and parenting style. Results: Both the TBI and OI analyses yielded different growth models for nonverbal ( k = 3) and verbal IQ ( k = 3). Although all models resulted in 3 latent classes (below average, average, and aboveaverage performance); trajectory shapes, contributors to class membership, and performance within each class varied by injury group and IQ domain. TBI severity was associated with class membership for nonverbal IQ, with less severe injuries associated with higher IQ scores; however, TBI severity did not influence verbal IQ class membership. Parenting style had a more prominent effect on verbal and nonverbal IQ within the TBI than OI trajectories. Conclusions: Findings suggest TBI severity is related to recovery trajectories for nonverbal but not verbal IQ and parenting style has stronger effects on recovery in TBI than OI. Results highlight the importance of parental factors on long-term recovery after TBI.",0.690596904

To investigate the relationships between PTG and posttraumatic stress 10 (T1) and 22 (T2) months after the bombing, a cross-lagged autoregressive model was applied. High levels of PTG at T1 were associated with high levels of posttraumatic stress at T2. Furthermore, high levels of posttraumatic stress at T1 were associated with high levels of PTG at T2. The association between PTG and stress declined from 10 to 22 months and was not significant after 22 months.

Three trajectories were identified, including a stable-low class, an increasing class, and a high-decreasing class. Results indicated that gender, parental psychological aggression and neglect, parental psychological control, traditional bullying/cyberbullying victimization, and friendship quality were significant predictors. However, witnessing intimate partner violence, parental behavior control, and traditional bullying/cyberbullying perpetration could not significantly predict the trajectories.

This prospective study investigated the longitudinal changes of psychosocial characteristics of patients with dentofacial deformities after jaw correction surgery and the factors that predict the psychological resilience in Hong Kong Chinese undergoing jaw correction surgery. Methods A longitudinal cohort study was conducted on 92 Hong Kong Chinese patients (32 males, 60 females; mean age = 24.75 ± 5.65 years), who had jaw correction surgery as treatment for their dentofacial deformities, from 1st June 2011 to 30th June 2015. Self-completed psychological inventories including Brief Symptom Inventory, Life Orientation Test, and the Adult Trait Hope Scale were used to measure distress, optimism, and hope levels respectively. Patients completed the inventories in five time points: the surgical consent signing day (usually two to three months before the surgery) (T1); one day before operation (T2), first to second post-operative week (T3), third post-operative month (T4) and sixth post-operative month (T5). Results Latent class growth analysis revealed two outcome trajectory classes: a resilience trajectory (n = 45, 48.9%) and a chronic dysfunction trajectory (n = 14, 15.2%). Another 33 (35.9%) showed erratic trajectory patterns that would not be classified into any categories. The psychological distress levels of patients in the resilience trajectory group, on average, were below the clinical threshold of the Brief Symptom Inventory at all time points. However, the opposite result was obtained for patients in the chronic dysfunctional group. Patients exhibiting a resilience trajectory pattern, when compared to those showing a chronic dysfunction pattern, had higher optimism (t(57) = 3.69, p < .0001) and hope (t(57) = 2.46, p < .05) levels at T1. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to compare the relative power of optimism and hope levels at T1 to predict resilience or chronic dysfunctional group membership. A test of the full model against a constant only model was statistically significant (χ2(2) = 24.096, p < .01). Preoperative baseline optimism (B = —.276, p < .05) but not hope (B = —.25, ns) was a significant variable to classify the outcome trajectories for psychological distress. Conclusions Most patients were resilient to dentofacial deformities jaw correction surgery. About 15% exhibited a chronic distress pattern. An optimistic view about the surgery may enhance resilience. Pre-surgical counselling or educational sessions to facilitate a realistic positive outlook about the operation would be beneficial.",0.690235377

Self-reported incident diabetes was measured during an 8-year follow-up.Five trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified (no depressive symptoms, low depressive symptoms, low-moderate depressive symptoms, moderate depressive symptoms, elevated and increasing depressive symptoms). Compared to the no depressive symptoms trajectory group (referent), all other trajectory groups were at higher risk of developing diabetes after adjusting for covariates. In most cases, trajectory group membership was associated with incident diabetes after controlling for depressive symptoms at a single time point.Patterns of depressive symptoms over time were associated with incident diabetes.

Recovery trajectories in pain, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and objectively registered physical activity were identified. Presurgical pain catastrophizing and pain intensity (risk), and psychological flexibility, and postsurgical pain acceptance (resilience) were examined as predictors of recovery.Latent growth class analyses revealed 4 distinct pain recovery trajectories (ie, Severe-Moderate [11%, n=9], Mild-No [58%, n=49], Moderate-Mild [24%, n=20], and Moderate-Severe [7%, n=6] pain trajectory), 2 HRQOL recovery trajectories; 2 trajectories characterizing recovery in average daily physical activity at moderate-to-vigorous intensity (MVPA); and 3 trajectories characterizing recovery in total physical activity volume characterized by the average daily number of steps. Subsequent multivariate analyses of variance revealed that presurgical pain intensity (partial η2=0.21, P<0.001) and pain catastrophizing (partial η2=0.13, P<0.01) were both predictive of poorer recovery in HRQOL, and pain catastrophizing additionally predicted poorer pain recovery (partial η2=0.15, P<0.05). Psychological flexibility (partial η2=0.25, P<0.001) and postsurgical pain acceptance (partial η2=0.07, P<0.05) were predictive of more favorable recovery trajectories in HRQOL, and psychological flexibility additionally predicted more favorable recovery trajectories in postsurgical pain (partial η2=0.15, P<0.05). Daily MVPA trajectories were not significantly predicted by any of the hypothesized factors, while presurgical pain catastrophizing levels were predictive of a delayed recovery trajectory in the daily amount of steps (partial η2=0.17 P<0.01).Presurgical screening could include assessment of pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, psychological flexibility, and pain acceptance to identify adolescents who are at risk for poorer recovery. These are potentially modifiable factors that can be targeted in presurgical interventions to prevent poor and foster adaptive outcomes after major surgery in adolescents.",0.689744575

However, change may not be uniform across patient groups and symptom domains. This study aimed to identify subgroups of patients with different trajectories of depression and anxiety symptom change during psychological therapy and identify baseline patient characteristics associated with these trajectories. 4394 patients attending two psychological treatment services completed sessional, self-report depression and anxiety measures. Trajectories of symptom change were investigated using latent class growth analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore associations between baseline patient characteristics and trajectory classes. A number of distinct trajectories were identified. Anxiety symptom trajectories could be distinguished by the third treatment session, but for depression symptoms there was a class displaying limited change until session six followed by rapid improvement in symptoms thereafter. Compared to the non-responding trajectories, depression and anxiety trajectories indicating treatment response were associated with lower baseline severity, better social functioning and lower incidence of phobic anxiety, but not with medication prescription status. Data came from two services, so wider generalisability is unknown. Predictors were limited to data routinely collected in the services; unmeasured factors may have improved the prediction of trajectories. Baseline characteristics and symptom change early in therapy can help identify different trajectories of symptom change. This knowledge could aid clinical decision making and help improve treatment outcomes. By ignoring distinct trajectories, clinicians may incorrectly consider patients as “not-on-track” and unnecessarily change or end therapy that would otherwise benefit patients.",0.689631969

Given evidence of significant individual differences in depression following major life stressors, we examined if heterogeneous depression responses confer differential risk for mortality. Data from a population-based longitudinal study was utilized to identify individuals who experienced divorce ( n = 559). Prospective trajectories of depression severity from before to after divorce were identified using latent growth mixture modeling, and rates of mortality between trajectories were compared as a distal outcome. Four trajectories demonstrated strongest model fit: resilience (67%), emergent depression (10%), chronic pre- to postdivorce depression (12%), and decreasing depression (11%). Mortality base rate was 9.7% by 6 years postevent, and depression that emerged due to divorce was associated with significantly greater mortality risk compared to resilient (odds ratio [OR] = 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.05, 5.81]) and to married individuals, whereas chronic depression was not associated with greater risk.",0.689260445

Little is known, however, about the course of PTS after life threat in the absence of collateral stressors (e.g., bereavement, social stigma, property loss) and there is a scarcity of studies about PTS in the long term. This study assessed the short- and long-term course of PTS, and the influence of gender, education and age on the level and course of PTS, in survivors from a non-fatal airliner emergency landing caused by engine failure at an altitude of 1 km. There were 129 persons on board. A survey including the Impact of Event Scale was distributed to 106 subjects after 1 month, 4 months, 14 months, and 25 months, and to 95 subjects after 19 years (response rates 64–83%). There were initially high levels of PTS. The majority of changes in PTS occurred from 1 to 4 months after the event. There were small changes from 4 to 25 months but further decrease in PTS thereafter. Female gender was associated with higher levels of PTS whereas gender was unrelated to the slope of the short- and long-term trajectories. Higher education was related to a quicker recovery although not to initial or long-term PTS. Age was not associated with PTS. The present findings suggest that a life-threatening experience without collateral stressors may produce high levels of acute posttraumatic stress, yet with a benign prognosis. The findings further implicate that gender is unrelated to trajectories of recovery in the context of highly similar exposure and few collateral stressors.",0.688791081

This study aimed at investigating the long-term course of maternal depressive symptoms and its association with various mother- and child-related characteristics in two West African lower middle income countries with focus on the relationship with long-term anxiety symptoms. Methods In the Child Development Study, a prospective birth cohort study in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was answered by N = 776 women 3 months antepartum, and 3, 12, and 24 months postpartum between April 2010 and March 2014. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms. Several psychosocial, obstetric, and sociodemographic characteristics were assessed and multinomial regression analysis was performed to investigate the influence of these variables on the different depression trajectories. Results We found three distinct classes of depressive symptoms that were characterized by an asymptomatic trajectory (91.5%), by recurrent risk (4.3%) and by postnatal risk (4.3%). The longitudinal course of depressive symptoms was strongly associated with anxiety symptoms (χ2 = 258.54, df = 6, p < 0.001; φ = .577). Among other factors, higher levels of anxiety, new pregnancy 2 years after birth, economic stress, and family stress were associated with the risk classes. Conclusions A substantial proportion of West African women in our sample developed unfavorable patterns of depressive symptoms during the vulnerable phase of pregnancy and early motherhood. Psychosocial factors, especially antepartum anxiety symptoms, played a decisive role in this process. Perceived economic hardship further exaggerated the mental health burden.",0.688698498
https://openalex.org/W2745736560,,Trajectory subtypes after injury and patient-centered outcomes,"Abstract Background The recent focus on patient-centered outcomes highlights the need to better describe recovery trajectories after injury. The purpose of this study was to characterize recovery trajectory subtypes that exist after non-neurologic injury. Materials and methods A prospective, observational cohort of 500 adults with an Injury Severity Score > 10 but without traumatic brain or spinal cord injury from 2009 to 2011 was formed. The Short Form-36 was administered at admission and repeated at 1, 2, 4, and 12 mo after injury. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to determine the number and shape of physical composite score (PCS) and mental composite score (MCS) trajectories. Results Three PCS trajectories and five MCS trajectories were identified. For PCS, trajectory 1 (10.4%) has low baseline scores, followed by no improvement over time. Trajectory 2 (65.6%) declines 1 mo after injury then improves over time. Trajectory 3 (24.1%) has a sharp decline followed by rapid recovery. For MCS, trajectory 1 (9.4%) is low at baseline and remains low. Trajectory 2 (14.4%) has a large decrease after injury and does not recover over the next 12 mo. Trajectory 3 (22.7%) has an initial decrease in MCS early, followed by continuous recovery. Trajectory 4 (19.1%) has a steady decline over the study period. Trajectory 5 (34.3%) stays consistently high at all time points. Conclusions Recovery after injury is complex and results in multiple recovery trajectories. This has implications for patient-centered clinical trial design and in development of patient-specific interventions to improve outcomes.",0.688119626

The hurricane's adverse impact on survivors' mental health was apparent shortly after the storm and persisted, but no study has examined the long-term effects now that more than a decade has transpired. Using new data from a panel study of low-income mothers interviewed once before Hurricane Katrina and now three times after, we document changes in mental health, and estimate the sociodemographic and hurricane-related factors associated with long-term trajectories of mental health. We find that post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) declined at each of the three post-Katrina follow-ups, but 12 years after the hurricane, one in six still had symptoms indicative of probable post-traumatic stress disorder. The rate of non-specific psychological distress (PD) remained consistently higher in all three follow-ups, compared to the pre-disaster period. In full covariate-adjusted models, no sociodemographic variables predicted long-run combinations of PTSS and PD. However, 12 years later, exposure to hurricane-related traumatic events and pre-disaster PD significantly predicted co-occurring PTSS and PD. Hurricane-related housing damage predicted PTSS in earlier follow-ups, but no longer predicted PTSS in the long-term. Furthermore, hurricane-related traumatic events significantly differentiated the risk of having persistent PTSS, relative to recovering from PTSS.

The aim of this study was to examine whether the presence of resilience resources before deployment, and the potential loss of these resources over time, are associated with the risk of PTSD symptoms five years post-deployment. The study focused on Dutch service members, deployed to Afghanistan or the Gulf of Aden. Pre-deployment resilience resources (i.e. coping self-efficacy, team cohesion, and perceived organizational support) were measured in 2012–2013 (n = 786). Five years after deployment a follow-up study (n = 148) measured the same resources as well as PTSD symptoms. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that fewer resources before deployment as well as a post-deployment decline in resources predicted PTSD. Low coping self-efficacy and low perceived organizational support before deployment as well as a decline in these resources over time were significantly related to PTSD symptoms five years post-deployment. This study therefore provides initial support for a relationship between a resource loss process and PTSD symptoms in veterans five years post-deployment.",0.687704632

However, the differential impact of the pandemic and lockdown on groups of individuals, and the personal characteristics associated with poorer outcomes are unknown. Method Data from 21 938 adults in England who participated in a stratified cohort study were analysed. Trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms were identified using growth mixture modelling. Multinomial and logistic regression models were constructed to identify sociodemographic and personality-related risk factors associated with trajectory class membership. Results Four trajectories of depression and five for anxiety were identified. The most common group presented with low symptom severity throughout, other classes were identified that showed: severe levels of symptoms which increased; moderate symptoms throughout; worsening mental health during lockdown but improvements after lockdown ended; and for anxiety only, severe initial anxiety that decreased quickly during lockdown. Age, gender, ethnicity, income, previous diagnoses, living situation, personality factors and sociability were associated with different trajectories. Conclusions Nearly 30% of participants experienced trajectories with symptoms in the clinical range during lockdown, and did not follow the average curve or majority group, highlighting the importance of differential trajectories. Young, female, outgoing and sociable people and essential workers experienced severe anxiety around the announcement of lockdown which rapidly decreased. Younger individuals with lower incomes and previous mental health diagnoses experienced higher and increasing levels of symptoms. Recognising the likely symptom trajectories for such groups may allow for targeted care or interventions.",0.687257403

This moderating effect was absent in non-traditional responders. Across both groups, post-disaster life stress also consistently was related to the dependent variables in a more robust manner than WTC exposure. : The present findings suggest that WTC exposure may compound post-disaster life stress, thereby resulting in a more chronic course of PTSD symptoms and reduced functioning among police responders.",0.687194408

Therefore, the possible relationship between OCPD trait symptoms and trajectories of postpartum depressive symptoms was examined. A cohort of 1427 women was followed from late pregnancy until 12 months’ postpartum. Trajectories of postpartum depressive symptoms were determined using growth mixture modeling with five repeated assessments. Next, the relationship between OCPD trait symptoms and these trajectories was examined through multinomial regression. Three postpartum depressive symptom trajectories were identified: (1) low symptoms (92%), (2) increasing-decreasing symptoms (inverted u-shape) (5%), and (3) increasing symptoms (3%). OCPD trait symptoms were associated with a higher likelihood of the trajectories increasing-decreasing symptoms (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.14–1.39) and increasing symptoms (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.02–1.32), compared to reference trajectory (low symptoms), adjusted for age, educational level, unplanned pregnancy, previous depressive episode (s), and parity.",0.686502682

The aim of this study was to describe the longitudinal trajectories of symptom burden for metastatic breast cancer patients at the population-level. A cohort of 995 metastatic breast cancer patients with 16,146 Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) assessments was constructed using linked population-level health administrative databases. The patient-reported ESAS total symptom distress score (TSDS) was studied over time using group-based trajectory modeling, and covariate influences on trajectory patterns were examined. Cohort patients experienced symptom burden that could be divided into six distinct trajectories. Patients experiencing a higher baseline TSDS were likely to be classified into trajectory groups with high, uncontrolled TSDS within the study follow-up period (χ2 (1, N = 995) = 136.25, p &lt; 0.001). Compared to patients classified in the group trajectory with the highest relative TSDS (Group 6), patients classified in the lowest relative TSDS trajectory group (Group 1) were more likely to not have comorbidities (97.34% (for Groups 1–3) vs. 91.82% (for Group 6); p &lt; 0.05), more likely to receive chemotherapy (86.52% vs. 80.50%; p &lt; 0.05), and less likely to receive palliative care (52.81% vs. 79.25%; p &lt; 0.0001). Receiving radiotherapy was a significant predictor of how symptom burden was experienced in all identified groups. Overall, metastatic breast cancer patients follow heterogeneous symptom burden trajectories over time, with some experiencing a higher, uncontrolled symptom burden. Understanding trajectories can assist in establishing risk-stratified care pathways for patients.",0.68632101

We evaluated whether similar patterns of illness course are observed in adolescents with bipolar I and II disorder who participated in a 2-year clinical trial.A total of 144 adolescents with bipolar I or II disorder, identified shortly after a mood episode, were assessed over a 2-year period. Participants were randomly assigned to one of 2 psychosocial family treatments during the first 9 months of the study, and pharmacotherapy was provided throughout the 2 years. Using latent class growth analyses, we classified participants into distinct courses of illness based on mood ratings collected over the 2 years. We examined demographic and illness variables as predictors of these course classifications.Latent class growth analyses indicated four mood trajectories: ""predominantly euthymic"" (29.9% of sample), ""ill with significantly improving course"" (11.1%), ""moderately euthymic"" (26.4%), and ""ill with moderately improving course"" (32.6%). Adolescents in these classes were euthymic 77.7%, 53.6%, 44.1%, and 18.6% of the weeks of follow-up, respectively. Psychosocial treatment condition and baseline medication exposure were not associated with trajectories. However, youth with more severe baseline depressive symptoms, suicidality, lower quality of life scores, and minority race/ethnicity had more symptomatic courses of illness over time.A substantial proportion (25%-30%) of youth with bipolar I or II disorder maintain euthymic states over extended periods of follow-up.

More common trajectories of adaptation include resilience, and posttraumatic growth (PTG). The objectives of the current study were to: (1) describe posttrauma adaptation profiles in a sample of Israeli male military veterans (N = 448); and (2) to explore the protective factors that promote constructive PTG within two profiles of posttrauma adaptation.The study used secondary data to estimate latent profile mixture models and a series of logistic regression analyses.Demographic controls, combat related variables, endorsement of coping strategies, and reports of improvement in social support were not significant predictors of constructive growth in the resilient class. However, those in the struggling growth subset of the sample who reported improvement in perceived social support increased the odds of reaching constructive growth.These findings highlight the importance of tailored clinical interventions that account for more complex profiles of posttrauma adaptation; and further, provide evidence that adaptation takes place over time. Finally, these findings call for future research to continue to explore the quality of PTG and the contexts in which protective factors promote positive adaptation.",0.686037084

Participants were assessed using the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI) from 6 to 18 months. Diagnostic outcomes were determined at age 3 years blind to previous assessments.Semiparametric group-based modeling using AOSI scores identified three distinct trajectories: Group 1 ('Low', n = 435, 64.3%) was characterized by a low level and stable evolution of ASD signs, group 2 ('Intermediate', n = 180, 26.6%) had intermediate and stable levels, and group 3 ('Inclining', n = 61, 9.3%) had higher and progressively elevated levels of ASD signs. Among younger siblings, ASD rates at age 3 varied by trajectory of early signs and were highest in the Inclining group, membership in which was highly specific (94.5%) but poorly sensitive (28.5%) to ASD. Children with ASD assigned to the inclining trajectory had more severe symptoms at age 3, but developmental and adaptive functioning did not differ by trajectory membership.These prospective data emphasize variable early-onset patterns and the importance of a multipronged approach to early surveillance and screening for ASD.",0.686028478

However, this hypothesis lacks strong empirical support because of the lack of prospective evidence. This study investigated whether experiencing multiple major health events diminishes rates of resilience and increases rates of mortality using a large population-based prospective cohort.There were n = 1,395 individuals sampled from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and examined prospectively from 2 years before 4 years after either single or multiple health events (lung disease, heart disease, stroke, or cancer). Distinct depression and resilience trajectories were identified using latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM). These trajectories were compared on rates of mortality 4 years after the health events.Findings indicated that 4 trajectories best fit the data including resilience, emergent postevent depression, chronic pre-to-post depression, and depressed prior followed by improvement. Analyses demonstrate that multiple health events do not decrease rates of resilience but do increase the severity of symptoms among those on the emergent depression trajectory. Emergent depression increased mortality compared with all others but among those in this class, rates were not different in response to single versus multiple health events.Multiple major stressors do not reduce rates of resilience. The emergence of depression after health events does significantly increase risk for mortality regardless of the number of events. (PsycINFO Database Record",0.684743726

DBT-A has been established as an effective treatment for reducing DSH, however less is known about changes in emotion dysregulation. This study aimed to identify baseline predictors of treatment response in outcome trajectories of DSH and emotion dysregulation.Response trajectories of DSH and ED were investigated using Latent Class Analysis on RCT data comparing DBT-A and EUC for 77 adolescents treated for deliberate self-harm and borderline traits. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine baseline predictors.Two-class solutions were selected for both indicators, distinguishing between early and late responders in DSH, and responders and non-responders in ED. Higher levels of depression, shorter DSH histories and not receiving DBT-A predicted less favourable response in DSH, while DBT-A was the only predictor of treatment response in ED.DBT-A was associated with a significantly faster reduction of deliberate self-harm in the short-term and improved emotion regulation in the long-term.",0.68425725

The cohort of 1275 adults (response 86%) followed-up in 2015 was a structured subsample drawn from the baseline nationally representative survey conducted in 2014 across 25 districts in Sri Lanka. Interviews were conducted using electronic tablets by field workers applying contextually adapted indices of trauma exposure, ongoing adversities and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Latent transition analysis revealed a three-class longitudinal model from which four composite trajectories were derived, comprising a persistent symptom trajectory (n=555, 43.5%), an incident or new onset trajectory (n=170, 13.3%), a recovery trajectory (n=299, 23.5%) and a persistently low-symptom trajectory (n=251, 19.7%). Factors associated with both the persistent symptom and incident trajectories were female gender, past trauma exposure and lack of access to health services. Loss of a job was uniquely associated with the persisting trajectory at follow-up. The recovery trajectory comprised a higher proportion of men, older persons and those without risk factors. Our findings assist in translating epidemiologic data into public policy and practice by indicating the importance of stable employment and the provision of healthcare as key factors that may act to reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms in the post-conflict phase. The findings also confirm that women are at high risk of mental distress. Brief screening for trauma exposure in populations with high levels of exposure to mass conflict may assist in defining those at risk of ongoing symptoms of anxiety and depression.",0.684225492

To promote the mental health of college students with childhood adversities, it is imperative to investigate the development of CPTSD symptoms and the predictive factors.The study aimed to examine the latent trajectories of CPTSD symptoms among college students with childhood adversities and to identify the role of self-compassion in differentiating potential trajectories.A total of 294 college students with childhood adversities completed self-report questionnaires on demographic backgrounds, childhood adversities, CPTSD symptoms, and self-compassion three times with an interval of three months. Latent class growth analysis was used to determine the trajectories of CPTSD symptoms. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the association between self-compassion and trajectories subgroups while adjusting for demographic variables.Three heterogeneous groups of CPTSD symptoms among college students with childhood adversities were identified: the low-symptoms group (n = 123, 41.8 %), the moderate-symptoms group (n = 108, 36.7 %), and the high-risk group (n = 63, 21.4 %). Multinomial logistic regression showed that, after adjusting for demographic variables, students with higher levels of self-compassion were less likely to belong to the moderate-symptoms and high-risk group in comparison to the low-symptoms group.The results suggest the trajectories of CPTSD symptoms of college students with childhood adversities were heterogeneous.

Through 10-year follow-up of a large cohort of Chinese adolescents exposed to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, this study examined whether individual variance in depressive symptoms during the early phases post-earthquake could generate different suicidality outcomes in young adulthood.A total of 1357 Chinese adolescents exposed to the Wenchuan earthquake were surveyed on depressive symptoms and other variables at 6, 18 and 30 months post-earthquake. In total, 799 participants responded to the 10-year follow-up and completed an online survey covering suicidality and other variables. The analytic sample was 744 participants who had valid data on depressive symptoms and suicidality. Data were analysed using logistic regressions.Prevalence estimates of past-year suicidal ideation, suicide plans and suicide attempts measured at 10 years post-earthquake were found to be 10.8%, 7.3% and 3.0%, respectively. Five trajectories of depressive symptoms were classified: resistance (54.4%), chronicity (13.3%), recovery (10.4%), delayed dysfunction (12.0%) and relapsing/remitting (10.0%). After controlling for covariates, whole-sample regressions revealed only the relapsing/remitting depressive trajectory remained significantly predictive of suicidality. Moreover, males not females in the chronic group were more likely to have suicide plans.The findings highlight the importance of detecting disaster survivors with different trajectories of mental status and providing with them individualised and effective mental health services, to decrease their risk of suicidality in the future.",0.683526757

Objectives This study examined the role of parent depression on changes in the parent–adolescent relationship, defined as support and conflict, and subsequent effects of relationship change on adolescent psychosocial outcomes including risky behavior, substance use, depressive symptoms, and hopelessness. Method Using data from a large prevention study, the sample included 110 youth at risk for high school drop out from the control condition; the sample was 48.2% of female, with a mean age of 15.9 years. The data, gathered from adolescents and their parents across a period of approximately 18 months, were analyzed using growth mixture modeling. Results Three distinct trajectories for parent–adolescent conflict (high-decreasing, low-increasing, low-stable trajectory) were identified as well as a single growth model for support, which revealed a slight decline in support across time. Parent depression was a significant predictor of perceived support, but not of membership in trajectories of conflict. Low parent–adolescent support was associated with adolescent depression and hopelessness measured 18 months post-baseline. Adolescents in the low but increasing conflict trajectory and those having a parent with depression reported increased depression and hopelessness 18 months later.

Using three waves of data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW-II), latent growth curve modeling was conducted on a sample of 350 adolescents who were between 11 and 13 years of age at baseline. Findings indicated that adolescents’ internalizing symptoms decreased over time, whereas externalizing symptoms remained stable over time. PTS symptoms decreased over time in girls, but not boys. Physical abuse predicted higher levels of externalizing behaviors and sexual abuse predicted a slower decrease in PTS symptoms. Greater child prosocial skills and higher quality of caregiver–child relationship were associated with lower initial levels of externalizing symptoms. In addition, a higher quality caregiver–child relationship and greater satisfaction with peer relationships were associated with lower initial levels of internalizing and PTS symptoms.

Participants were 688 youths (girls n = 354, 51.5%; M age at outset = 8.66 years, SD = 0.50). Latent class growth analyses identified two AS trajectory classes in elementary school (moderate-decreasing, high-increasing) and three in middle school (low-stable, low-increasing, high-decreasing). The elementary school moderate-decreasing class was two-and-a-half times more likely than others to end in the middle school low-stable class. In contrast, the elementary school high-increasing class was twice as likely as others to end in the middle school low-increasing class, and four times as likely to end in the middle school high-decreasing class. Peer exclusion predicted membership in increasing AS trajectory classes in both elementary and middle school, whereas the middle school high-decreasing AS trajectory class demonstrated decreasing peer exclusion during middle school. Likewise, inability to defend oneself predicted membership in increasing AS trajectory classes in both elementary and middle school, whereas membership in the middle school high-decreasing AS trajectory class was predicted by inability to defend oneself in elementary but not middle school. High-decreasing AS youths’ improved ability to defend themselves in middle school appeared to be related to a cascade of improvements in related domains. In contrast, membership in increasing AS classes in elementary and middle school predicted symptoms of social anxiety and depression.",0.682844772
https://openalex.org/W2806856320,,Early recovery trajectories after total hip replacement: the role of patient characteristics,"Background: Total hip replacement (THR) is considered to be a successful treatment for end-stage hip osteoarthritis. However, not all patients experience the same amount of improvement after surgery. The aim of the present study is to characterise subgroups of patients based on their recovery experience after THR.

Methods: Patients (n = 94) from a single hospital participated in a diary study. For 6 weeks, patients weekly recorded their severity of hip problems (Oxford Hip Score, OHS) after THR. Latent class growth modelling (LCGM) was used to identify patients with the same hip function trajectory and to compare these subgroups on pre- and post-operative patient characteristics.

Findings: LCGM revealed a fast (n = 17, 18.1%), average (n = 53, 56.4%) and slow (n = 24, 25.5%) recovery subgroup. Subgroups differed not on baseline OHS, but on the estimated weekly growth rate during the first 2 weeks (fast: 9.52; average: 5.30; slow: 2.68), with less differences between groups in the last 4 weeks (fast: 0.90; average: 2.02; slow: 1.73). Patients in the slow recovery group could be characterised as women of older age (mean age = 69) who rated their health as lower pre-operatively, needed more assistance during recovery, and were less satisfied with the outcomes of the surgery. 

Discussion: We identified distinct recovery trajectories in the first 6 weeks after THR which were associated with patient characteristics. Our findings suggest that care pathways for THR may need to be tailored to cater to the needs of specific subgroups.",0.682710644

These patients were included if their Geriatric Depression Scale short form scores were ≥ 5 before discharge or 1, 3, 6, or 12 months following discharge. Individuals who followed similar developmental depressive-symptom trajectories were identified by group-based trajectory modeling. Associations between trajectory-group membership and postoperative outcomes over the 12 months following discharge were evaluated by the generalized estimating equations method.We identified a progressively lower-risk group and a fluctuating higher-risk group. Patients' membership in the progressively lower-risk group was associated with receiving a comprehensive care model featuring psychological and physical interventions. Membership in this group was associated with better postoperative outcomes and fewer emergency department visits or hospital readmissions. Patients were more likely to belong to the fluctuating higher-risk group if they had more comorbidities or worse prefracture mobility. Patients in the fluctuating higher-risk group not only had higher levels of depressive symptoms, but also a greater likelihood of poor postoperative recovery outcomes.Depressive symptoms in elderly hip-fracture patients may be alleviated by postoperative comprehensive care that features both psychological and physical interventions.

Latent-class growth analysis and structural equation models examined the actor and partner effects of depressive symptom trajectories on memory.Four depressive symptom trajectories were identified (i.e., persistently low, increasing, decreasing, and persistently high). Compared to the low trajectory group, the increasing and persistently high trajectories were associated with worse memory for both men and women. While none of the wives' depressive symptom trajectories was significantly associated with husbands' memory (p > .05), husbands' decreasing trajectory was linked to wives' better memory (β = 0.498, 95% CI = 0.106, 0.890).Older adults with increasing and persistently high depressive symptoms may experience worse memory. Psychosocial interventions targeting depressive symptoms among older men may be beneficial to their spouses' memory.",0.68219807

Aim:This cross-sectional study examined the effect of social support, gratitude, resilience and satisfaction with life on symptoms of depression. Method:A total of 86 male and 30 female police officers from Louisiana participated in this study. Ordinary least-square (OLS) regression mediation analysis was used to estimate direct and indirect effects between social support, gratitude, resilience, satisfaction with life and symptoms of depression. All models were adjusted for age, alcohol intake, military experience and an increase in the number of sick days since Hurricane Katrina. Results:Mean depressive symptom scores were 9.6 ± 9.1 for females and 10.9 ± 9.6 for males. Mediation analyses indicates that social support and gratitude are directly associated with fewer symptoms of depression. Social support also mediated the relationships between gratitude and depression, gratitude and satisfaction with life, and satisfaction with life and depression. Similarly, resilience mediated the relationship between social support and fewer symptoms of depression. Conclusion:Social support, gratitude and resilience are associated with higher satisfaction with life and fewer symptoms of depression. Targeting and building these factors may improve an officer’s ability to address symptoms of depression.",0.682099032

The sample consisted of 266 children and adolescents (aged 7–17 years) with OCD, participating in the Nordic long-term OCD treatment study. Latent class growth analysis was conducted using Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale-Revised (COIS-R) data from children and parents on seven assessment points over a three-year period. A 3-class solution was identified. The largest class (70.7%) initiated treatment with lower functional impairment and obtained moderate reduction which was maintained over time. The second class (24.4%) initiated with higher functional impairment which rapidly diminished over time. The third and smallest class (4.9%), initiated with moderate functional impairment which remained stable over time. The classes differed on measures of OCD severity and comorbid symptoms. Most participants improved with treatment and maintained low levels of impairment.

The present study prospectively analysed trajectories of depressive symptoms in adults during the first 5 years of living with type 1 diabetes. We aimed to identify distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms and to examine how they affect diabetes outcome.We reanalysed data from a prospective multicentre observational cohort study including 313 adults with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. At baseline and in annual postal surveys over 5 consecutive years, we gathered patient characteristics and behavioural and psychosocial data (e.g. Symptom Checklist-90-R [SCL-90-R]). Medical data (e.g. HbA1c levels) was obtained from the treating physicians. We applied growth mixture modelling (GMM) to identify distinct trajectories of depression over time.Five years after diagnosis, 7.8% (n = 20) of patients were moderately depressed and 10.2% (n = 26) were severely depressed. GMM statistics identified three possible models of trajectories (class 1, 'no depressive symptoms'; class 2, 'worsening depressive symptoms that improve after 2 years'; class 3, 'worsening depressive symptoms'). Severity of depression symptoms at baseline (subscale of the SCL-90-R questionnaire) significantly predicted membership of classes 2 and 3 vs class 1. After 5 years, higher HbA1c values were detected in class 3 patients (mean = 8.2%, 66 mmol/mol) compared with class 1 and class 2 (both: mean = 7.2%, 55 mmol/mol).We identified distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms that are also relevant for diabetes outcome. Patients with worsening depressive symptoms over time exhibited poor glycaemic control after the first 5 years of living with diabetes.

However, there is a gap in current literature investigating the long-term, dynamic effects of childhood neglect on adult affective symptoms (AS).Data were used from the National Child Development Study (a British 1958 birth cohort). Childhood neglect was prospectively measured at ages 7 and 11. Five distinct trajectories of AS have been derived previously, using data from the Malaise Inventory Scale (at ages 23, 33, 42 and 50): 'no symptoms', 'persistent mild/moderate symptoms', 'low and increasing symptoms', 'high and increasing symptoms' and 'high and decreasing symptoms' (John et al., 2019). Multinomial logistic regressions were used to explore whether childhood neglect was associated with AS trajectory membership, while adjusting for a number of covariates.Results revealed that childhood neglect was significantly associated with 'high and decreasing', 'high and increasing' and 'persistent mild/moderate' AS trajectories from young adulthood through midlife. There was no association with the 'low and increasing' AS trajectory. When testing for at age specific effects, neglect experienced at age 7 only, or at age 11 only, was predictive of 'high and decreasing symptoms' trajectory, whereas neglect experienced at both ages was predictive of 'persistent mild/moderate symptoms' trajectory.Childhood neglect has negative long-lasting effects on trajectories of adult mental health. This finding has important implications for early intervention for individuals who have experienced childhood neglect.",0.681272943

The person characteristic trait mindfulness may be such a protective factor. Because of the high variability in depressive symptoms over time, we aimed to assess the association between trait mindfulness and trajectories of depressive symptoms during pregnancy.A subsample of 762 women participating in the HAPPY study completed the Three Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form at 22 weeks of pregnancy. Possible different trajectories of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores, assessed at each pregnancy trimester, were explored with growth mixture modeling.Three EPDS trajectories (classes) were identified: low stable symptom scores (N = 607, 79.7%), decreasing symptom scores (N = 74, 9.7%) and increasing symptom scores (N = 81, 10.6%). Compared to belonging to the low stable class (reference), women with higher scores on the trait mindfulness facets 'acting with awareness' and 'non-judging' were less likely to belong to the decreasing class (OR = 0.81, 95% CI [0.73, 0.90] and OR = 0.77, 95% CI [0.70, 0.84]) and increasing class (OR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.80, 0.97] and OR = 0.72, 95% CI [0.65, 0.79]). Women with higher scores on 'non-reacting' were less likely to belong to the increasing class (OR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.82, 0.97]), but not the decreasing class (OR = 0.96, 95% CI [0.87, 1.04]).

Since these levels of symptoms can vary greatly over time, the current study investigated the existence of possible longitudinal trajectories of depressive symptoms during pregnancy, and aimed to identify factors associated with these trajectories. Depressive symptoms were assessed prospectively at each trimester in 1832 women, using the Edinburgh (Postnatal) Depression Scale (E(P)DS). Growth mixture modeling was used to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Three trajectories of depressive symptoms (E(P)DS scores) were identified: low stable (class 1, reference group, 83%), decreasing (class 2, 7%), and increasing (class 3, 10%). Classes 2 and 3 had significantly higher mean E(P)DS scores (7–13 throughout pregnancy) compared to the reference group (stable; E(P)DS <4). Factors associated with trajectories 2 and 3 included previous depressive episodes, life events during pregnancy, and unplanned pregnancy. Notably, the only factor distinguishing classes 2 and 3 was the perception of partner involvement experienced by women during their pregnancies. Class 2 (with decreasing E(P)DS scores) reported high partner involvement, while class 3 (with increasing E(P)DS scores) reported poor partner involvement throughout pregnancy. Depressive symptoms were assessed by self-report rather than a diagnostic interview. The participants were more often both highly educated and of Caucasian ethnicity compared to the general Dutch population. Poor partner involvement was associated with increasing depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Health professionals should focus on partner involvement during pregnancy in order to identify women who are potentially vulnerable for perinatal depression.",0.681173023

This study examines associations between trajectory patterns of neighborhood changes and depressive symptoms using data from Waves I-IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We used latent class growth analysis to determine the number and distribution of person-centered trajectories for neighborhood characteristics, and multilevel growth curve models to examine how belonging to each class impacted depression trajectories from ages 13 to 32 among non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB), Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Others (NHO). The distribution of neighborhood SES classes across racial/ethnic groups suggests significant levels of economic inequality, but had no effect on depressive symptoms. A more complex picture emerged on the number and distribution of racial/ethnic composition latent class trajectories. Compared to NHB peers who lived in predominantly NHW neighborhoods from adolescence to adulthood, NHBs in more diverse neighborhoods had lower risk for depressive symptoms. Conversely, Hispanics living in neighborhoods with fewer NHWs had higher risk for depressive symptoms. Among NHOs, living in neighborhoods with a critical mass of other NHOs had a protective effect against depressive symptoms.",0.680758321

We used Growth Mixture Modeling to analyze different trajectories of depressive symptoms in a sample of 1,072 Chilean adolescents (12-15 years old, 54% female). First, a baseline model was selected and then adolescent irritability, maternal warmth, demandingness and disrespect were introduced to the model as predictors of class membership. Four latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified: high persistent (12%), low stable (56%), high decreasing (15%) and low increasing (17%). Low stable was the most prevalent class, and was characterized by higher maternal warmth and lower maternal disrespect and adolescent irritability while high persistent was characterized by the opposite maternal characteristics. Significant gender differences in class membership were observed. The results highlight the importance of identifying different trajectories of depressive symptoms and specific predictors of each trajectory. The association of parenting dimensions with trajectories of persistent depressive symptoms provides evidence that parenting can serve as both a protective and risk factor for adolescent adjustment. La sintomatología depresiva es prevalente durante la adolescencia, pero no todos los adolescentes experimentan el mismo nivel y evolución de esta sintomatología, lo que sugiere la necesidad de identificar diferencias en las trayectorias de los síntomas. Usando Growth Mixture Modeling analizamos diferentes trayectorias de síntomas depresivos en 1.072 adolescentes chilenos (12-15 años, 54% mujeres). Primero, se seleccionó un modelo basal y luego se utilizó la irritabilidad del adolescente, la calidez, demanda y falta de respeto de la madre como predictores de la pertenencia a las clases. Se seleccionó un modelo con 4 clases latentes de síntomas depresivos: alta persistente (12%), baja estable (56%), alta decreciente (15%) y baja creciente (17%). La clase baja estable fue la más prevalente y se caracterizó por alto nivel de calidez maternal y bajo nivel de falta de respeto materna e irritabilidad del adolescente, en tanto que la clase alta persistente presentó características opuestas (baja calidez y alta demanda materna e irritabilidad del adolescente). Se observaron diferencias en la prevalencia de clases por sexo. Estos resultados resaltan la importancia de identificar diferentes trayectorias de síntomas depresivos y sus predictores. La asociación entre las dimensiones parentales y las trayectorias de síntomas depresivos persistentes provee evidencia de que los comportamientos parentales pueden servir, tanto como factores protectores como de riesgo.",0.680687134

Whilst some remit with little or no intervention, others may suffer a more prolonged course of symptoms. The aim of this study was to identify trajectory patterns for depressive symptoms in a Chinese primary care cohort and their associated factors. Methods and Results A 12-month cohort study was conducted. Patients recruited from 59 primary care clinics across Hong Kong were screened for depressive symptoms using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and monitored over 12 months using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9) administered at 12, 26 and 52 weeks. 721 subjects were included for growth mixture modelling analysis. Using Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion, Entropy and Lo-Mendell-Rubin adjusted likelihood ratio test, a seven-class trajectory path model was identified. Over 12 months, three trajectory groups showed improvement in depressive symptoms, three remained static, whilst one deteriorated. A mild severity of depressive symptoms with gradual improvement was the most prevalent trajectory identified. Multivariate, multinomial regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with each trajectory. Risk factors associated with chronicity included: female gender; not married; not in active employment; presence of multiple chronic disease co-morbidities; poor self-rated general health; and infrequent health service use. Conclusions Whilst many primary care patients may initially present with a similar severity of depressive symptoms, their course over 12 months can be quite heterogeneous. Although most primary care patients improve naturalistically over 12 months, many do not remit and it is important for doctors to be able to identify those who are at risk of chronicity. Regular follow-up and greater treatment attention is recommended for patients at risk of chronicity.",0.680628328

Recent machine learning approaches have yielded insight into predicting PTSD symptom trajectories. Using data collected within 1 month of traumatic injury, we applied eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) to classify admitted and discharged patients (hospitalized, n = 192; nonhospitalized, n = 214), recruited from a Level 1 trauma center, according to PTSD symptom trajectories. Trajectories were identified using latent class mixed models on PCL‐5 scores collected at baseline, 1–3 months posttrauma, and 6 months posttrauma. In both samples, nonremitting, remitting, and resilient PTSD symptom trajectories were identified. In the admitted patient sample, a unique delayed trajectory emerged. Machine learning classifiers (i.e., XGB) were developed and tested on the admitted patient sample and externally validated on the discharged sample with biological and clinical self‐report baseline variables as predictors. For external validation sets, prediction was fair for nonremitting versus other trajectories, areas under the curve (AUC = .70); good for nonremitting versus resilient trajectories, AUCs = .73–.76; and prediction failed for nonremitting versus remitting trajectories, AUCs = .46–.48. However, poor precision (&lt; .57) across all models suggests limited generalizability of nonremitting symptom trajectory prediction from admitted to discharged patient samples. Consistency in symptom trajectory identification across samples supports prior studies on the stability of PTSD symptom trajectories following trauma exposure; however, continued work and replication with larger samples are warranted to understand overlapping and unique predictive features of PTSD in different traumatic injury populations.",0.680406731

Higher pain after a traumatic injury has been associated with higher PTSD symptoms and thus may be a risk factor. However, few studies have examined how pain during the period immediately after a trauma, referred to as the acute posttrauma period, relates later to PTSD outcomes. Methods A sample of ( n = 87) individuals who had experienced a traumatic injury assessed their pain through daily mobile assessments for the first month after injury. PTSD, depression, and functional impairment were assessed at the time of trauma and 1 and 3 months later. Results Using latent class growth analysis, three trajectories of pain were identified: low pain (41.3%), decreasing pain (43.7%), and high pain (14.9%). At baseline, the high-pain class reported higher levels of depression and functional impairment than did the low-pain group. From baseline to 3 months, the low-pain class experienced a reduction in PTSD, depression, and functional impairment, whereas the high-pain class experienced an increase in PTSD symptoms, persistent depression, and functional impairment. Conclusions These results demonstrate that there are distinct trajectories of pain after a traumatic injury. Persistent elevated pain is associated with more severe psychopathology in the period immediately after a traumatic injury.",0.680395504

The present study investigated the utility of routine outcome monitoring during acute inpatient hospitalization for identifying emerging adults at risk of poor outcomes. This is a retrospective study using latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify patient groups with different recovery trajectories, with additional analyses to clarify the characteristics of these trajectory groups. The results identified four patient groups: Rapid responders (38%), gradual responders (34%), high distress non-responders (9%), and low distress non-responders (19%). The high distress non-responding group is characterized by behaviours and disorders associated with ambivalent care seeking: Voluntary admission, longer length of stay, lower service satisfaction, higher outpatient service utilization, elevated risk of emergency department presentation and hospital readmission, and depression/personality disorder diagnosis. The low distress group is characterized by behaviours and disorders associated with treatment rejection: Involuntary admission, shorter length of stay, reduced post-discharge service utilization, and psychotic disorder diagnosis.

Thus, research is urgently needed to explore the relationship between ACEs pattern and trajectory of depressive symptom levels at multiple time points in order to provides early targeted interventions to those who are most at risk.We aimed to explore patterns of ACEs, including types and timing, associated with depression trajectories in college students.A school-based health survey was used to collect data as part of a longitudinal study in two medical college in Anhui province, China. Questionnaires were issued to 3,662 participants aged 17-22 and recorded details of ACEs (types and timing) and depression. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify ""patterns"" of ACEs type and timing. Depressive symptom trajectories employed latent class growth analysis (LCGA). Multiple logistic regressions were employed to evaluate the relationships between ACEs patterns and depressive symptom trajectories.We identified five ACEs patterns: ""High neglect/emotional abuse/community violence,"" ""High neglect/emotional abuse,"" ""High neglect/family dysfunction,"" ""High neglect,"" ""Low ACEs."" We traced three depression trajectories: ""High depressive symptom"" ""Moderate depressive symptom,"" ""Low depressive symptom.""

However, relatively little is known about differential patterns of change in depression or generalised anxiety linked to deployment to a combat zone. In this paper, we add to the existing trajectory literature and examine key predictive factors of behavioural health risk. Aims The primary aim is to leverage growth mixture modelling to ascertain trajectories of psychological distress, operationalised as a coherent construct combining depression and generalised anxiety, and to identify factors that differentiate adaptive and maladaptive patterns of change. Method Data were collected from a brigade combat team prior to a combat deployment to Afghanistan, during deployment, at immediate re-integration and approximately 2–3 months thereafter. The main outcome was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results Three latent trajectories were identified: a low–stable trajectory, a declining trajectory and a rising trajectory. Most individuals aligned with the low–stable trajectory. A conditional model using covariates measured during deployment showed that the low–stable trajectory differed consistently from the remaining trajectories on self-reported loneliness and non-combat deployment stressors. Conclusions The examination of differential patterns of adaptation, to identify individuals at higher risk, is critical for the efficient targeting of resources. Our findings further indicate that loneliness may be a useful leverage point for clinical and organisational intervention.",0.679374623

This study also documents the implications of these trajectories for a variety of educational outcomes. A sample of 461 first-year undergraduates completed all measures three times over the course of a University semester. Longitudinal growth mixture analyses (GMA) revealed three distinct need satisfaction trajectories (Low-Decreasing, Moderate-Decreasing, and Moderate-Increasing). The Moderate-Increasing profile was associated with the highest levels of positive affect and effort. In contrast, the Low-Decreasing profile was associated with lower levels of positive affect, effort, and achievement, and higher levels of negative affect than the Moderate-Increasing profile.",0.679335931

High job demands, low job control, and the combination (high strain) are associated with depression. However, few longitudinal studies have investigated changed or repeated exposure to demands and control related to depression. We investigated how trajectories of exposure to job demands and control jointly influence subsequent depression.We included 7949 subjects from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health, who completed questionnaires of perceived job demands and control, and depressive symptoms from 2006 to 2014. None of them were depressed between 2006 and 2012. Univariate and joint group-based trajectory models identified groups with similar development of demands and control across 2006-2012. Logistic regression estimated the risk for symptoms of major depression in 2014 according to joint trajectory groups.The joint trajectory model included seven groups, all with fairly stable levels of demands and control over time. Subjects in the high strain and active (high demands and high control) trajectories were significantly more likely to have subsequent major depressive symptoms compared to those having low strain, controlling for demographic covariates (OR 2.15; 95% Cl 1.24-3.74 and OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.23-3.40, respectively). The associations did not remain statistically significant after adjusting for previous depressive symptoms in addition to demographic covariates.The results indicate that the levels of job demands and control were relatively unchanged across 6 years and suggest that long-term exposure to a high strain or active job may be associated with increased risk for subsequent depression.",0.679283519

Among many possible risk factors, the stressor-related emotional responses may play an important role in future development of depressive symptoms. Purpose The current study examined how individuals’ positive and negative emotional responses to everyday stressors predicted their subsequent changes in depressive symptoms over 18 months. Methods Using an ecological momentary assessment approach, participants (n = 176) reported stressor exposure, positive affect (PA), and negative affect (NA) five times a day for 1 week (n = 5,483 observations) and provided longitudinal reports of depressive symptoms over the subsequent 18 months. A multivariate multilevel latent growth curve model was used to directly link the fluctuations in emotions in response to momentary stressors in everyday life with the long-term trajectory of depressive symptoms. Results Adults who demonstrated a greater difference in stressor-related PA (i.e., relatively lower PA on stressor vs. nonstressor moments) reported larger increases in depressive symptoms over 18 months. Those with greater NA responses to everyday stressors (i.e., relatively higher NA on stressor vs. nonstressor moments), however, did not exhibit differential long-term changes in depressive symptoms. Conclusions Adults showed a pattern consistent with both PA and NA responses to stressors in everyday life, but only the stressor-related changes in PA (but not in NA) predicted the growth of depressive symptoms over time. These findings highlight the important—but often overlooked—role of positive emotional responses to everyday stressors in long-term mental health.",0.679075582

This paper focused on two aims: (i) identification of school academic recovery trajectories; and (ii) examination of potential risk factors associated with these trajectories. We used latent class growth analysis to identify school academic recovery trajectories for a cohort of 462 Texas public schools that were in the path of Hurricane Ike in 2008. Using Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) data from 2005 to 2011, we found that attendance and percent of economically disadvantaged youth emerged as significant risk factors for two identified academic recovery trajectories (High‐Stable and Low‐Interrupted). Higher levels of economically disadvantaged youth were associated with lower likelihood of falling in the High‐Stable trajectory, relative to the Low‐Interrupted trajectory. Higher levels of attendance were associated with higher likelihood of membership in the High‐Stable trajectory, relative to the Low‐Interrupted trajectory. These findings are consistent with the notion that disasters do not affect all people or communities equally. Findings highlight the need for policy initiatives that focus on low performing schools, as these schools are at highest risk for adverse outcomes post‐disaster.",0.678677988

Participants were 18,896 WTC responders, including 8466 police officers and 10,430 non-traditional responders (85.8% male; 86.4% Caucasian; Mage = 39.5, SD = 8.8) participating in the WTC Health Program who completed an initial examination between July, 2002 and April, 2010 and who were reassessed, on average, 2.5 years later. Path analyses were conducted to evaluate contributions of life events to the maintenance of WTC-related posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and overall functioning. These analyses were stratified by police and non-traditional responder groups and adjusted for age, sex, time from 9/11 to initial visit, WTC exposures (three WTC contextual exposures: co-worker, friend, or a relative died in the disaster; co-worker, friend, or a relative injured in the disaster; and responder was exposed to the dust cloud on 9/11), and interval from initial to first follow-up visit. In both groups, WTC-related posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and overall functioning were stable over the follow-up period. WTC exposures were related to these three outcomes at the initial assessment. WTC-related posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and overall functioning, at the initial assessment each predicted the occurrence of post-disaster stressful life events, as measured by Disaster Supplement of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Post-disaster stressful life events, in turn, were associated with subsequent mental health, indicating partial mediation of the stability of observed mental health. The present findings suggest a dynamic interplay between exposure, post-disaster stressful life events, and WTC-related posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and overall functioning among WTC disaster responders.",0.678517005

They not only describe a single individual developmental trajectory, but also captures individual differences in these trajectories over time have been developed. The simplest latent growth curve model involves one variable measured the same way at two time points. However, two points in time are not ideal for studying development or for using growth curve methodology: two-wave designs are appropriate only if the intervening growth process is considered irrelevant or is known to be linear. With more than two time occasions the validity of the straight-line growth model for the trajectory can be evaluated, and the precision of parameter estimates will tend to increase. For these reasons, this work will cover models for at least three-wave data, and in addition it will focus on nonlinear LCM.",0.677825869

Compared with patients in the quick recovery class, patients in the persistent moderate symptom class had more instrumental activities of daily living/mobility limitations and lower levels of subjective social support. Patients in the persistent high symptom class had higher levels of perceived stress and lower levels of social support compared with those with a quick recovery. Patients in the slow recovery class had a younger age of onset compared with those in the quick recovery group. In multinomial logistic regression, levels of perceived stress and social support at baseline significantly differed across classes controlling for demographic and health variables.Older patients diagnosed with major depression can have varying patterns of response to treatment. Interventions targeting those patients with higher levels of perceived stress and lower levels of subjective social support at the time of the index episode may lead to more favorable long-term trajectories.

The present study aimed to analyze children's and adolescents' responses to conflict-related potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and the impact of the number of different types of PTEs on psychological symptoms and resilience over time. We investigated the presence of psychological symptoms and resilience, defined as low levels of symptoms and high levels of hope, in a sample of 597 conflict-affected children and adolescents allocated to a waiting list condition in four randomized trials conducted in Burundi, Indonesia, Nepal and Sri Lanka. A decrease in functional impairment (p < 0.001), symptoms of PTSD (p < 0.001), anxiety (p < 0.001), depression (p = 0.052), and an increase in social support (p < 0.001), was observed over a six-month follow-up. More than one third of children and adolescents (34.6%) exposed to conflict-related traumatic events improved at follow-up. Levels of hope did not significantly change. Improvement in psychological symptoms and resilience were significantly associated with the number of different types of PTEs experienced before study entry. This study showed that children and adolescents have the capacity to react to multiple traumatic events, and that the number of different types of traumatic events has an impact on resilience mechanisms. This will help differentiate the choice and focus of psychosocial interventions according to the amount of traumatic events experienced by children and adolescents, and will inform the development and testing of new psychosocial interventions.",0.676683961

Subjects (n = 87) filled out questionnaires (RRS-NL-EXT trait rumination and NEO-FFI neuroticism) and performed cognitive tasks (trail making test, Stroop task) during a period of 30 weeks. To identify distinct depressive symptom trajectories ('trajectory groups'), we performed K-means clustering on the consecutive (assessed every 2 weeks) Major Depression Inventory scores. This resulted in four trajectory groups; 'resilience', 'fast recovery', 'slow recovery' and 'chronic distress'. The 'slow recovery group' and the 'chronic distress group' were found to have higher neuroticism and trait rumination levels compared to the 'resilience group', and the 'chronic distress group' also had higher neuroticism levels than the 'fast recovery group'. Moreover, the 'chronic distress group' showed worse overall trail making test performance than the 'resilience group'.

Most parents manage some degree of parenting stress without serious concerns, but young mothers experience parenting stress at higher levels than adult mothers; high parenting stress is problematic due to its association with children’s socioemotional and behavior problems and the increased likelihood of maltreatment. Understanding the circumstances that precipitate or mitigate parents’ stress can have lasting impacts for child well-being. Extant research fails to account for both longitudinal and individual variation in young mothers’ parenting stress, leading to equivocal findings about the nature of mothers’ parenting stress trajectories across early childhood. Design. The present study used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to model the trajectories of 544 first-time young mothers’ parenting stress from children’s infancy to school-age. We considered how protective factors (i.e., social support) and psychological vulnerabilities (i.e., depression) experienced during the transition to parenthood were associated with parenting stress trajectories and variation within trajectories when children were of school-age. Results. GMM identified three trajectories of parenting stress: “low stable”, “high increasing”, and “high decreasing.” Protective factors were related to low and decreasing patterns of parenting stress, whereas psychological vulnerabilities were associated with higher parenting stress patterns. Conclusions. This study has implications for programs and services that help young mothers cope with the demands of parenting and reduce parenting stress.",0.676140553

However, it is not entirely clear what factors are essential for the development of PTG, especially after natural disasters. Most importantly, it is uncertain what type of relationship exists between posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and PTG. As yet, there is also no consensus on whether PTG can best be seen as a process outcome or as a coping mechanism. The current study aimed to elucidate these uncertainties.The study explored PTG in a community sample (N = 412) 10-11 months after a major earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand. Nonsymptomatic predictors of PTG were assessed 4-7 months after the earthquake, and symptomatic predictors were assessed both 4-7 and 10-11 months after the earthquake, with PTG measured in the second assessment.Results showed that the unique relationship between PTSS and PTG was modeled best both linearly and curvilinearly, suggesting that PTSS over a certain level shift from a positive association with PTG to a negative one. PTG was predicted by being female, having less household income, PTSS symptoms modeled linearly and curvilinearly at Time 1, and PTSS modeled linearly at Time 2.Support was found for the coping model of PTG, suggesting the importance of fostering growth to manage posttraumatic distress.

Depression was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. A semiparametric mixture model was used to estimate distinct group-based developmental trajectories of depression and determine whether trajectory group membership varied according to maternal characteristics.A total of 2802 (93%) of mothers completed interviews through 12 months. The mixture model indicated six distinct depression trajectories. A history of anxiety or depression, unattached marital status, and inadequate social support were significantly associated with higher odds of belonging to trajectory groups with greater depression.

In contrast to research conceptualizing resilience as a dispositional trait, we conceptualize resilience in terms of patterns of between-individual variation in response trajectories (dynamic resilience). In a longitudinal study spanning three months and 12 observational periods, we show that individuals high in emotional stability had more static affective commitment trajectories and that organizational newcomers had less pronounced emotional exhaustion trajectories in response to ongoing demands. Both the patterns shown for those with high emotional stability and newcomers are indicative of greater dynamic resilience. Furthermore, we found that affective commitment trajectories were significant predictors of actual retention through the mediating mechanism of intent to remain.

Different patterns, with both improvement and decline, are expected, depending on premorbid cognitive functioning and events that occur during hospitalization. These patterns are unknown and important for older hip fracture patients with different levels of premorbid cognitive functioning.We conducted a secondary analysis of a multi-center randomized controlled trial. 302 consecutive patients aged 65-102 years old, admitted for hip fracture surgery, were enrolled. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was obtained at hospital admission, at discharge, and at 3 and 12 months after discharge. Cognitive trajectories were identified with Group Based Trajectory Modelling, using the repeated MMSE measurements as outcome variable. To illustrate the specific characteristics of this relative novel methodological approach, it was contrasted with results obtained from linear mixed effects modeling.146 (48.3%) patients had premorbid cognitive impairment and 85 patients (28.1%) experienced delirium during admission. Three distinct cognitive trajectories were identified and labeled based on different MMSE course over time: improvement (57.9%), stable (28.1%), and rapid decline (13.9%), with an annual MMSE change of 1.7, 0.8, and -3.5 points respectively. With mixed effects modeling an overall annual increase of 0.7 MMSE points was estimated for the group as a whole.Three distinct cognitive trajectories were identified in a population of older hip fracture patients. These trajectory groups can be used as a starting point to inform patients and caregivers on the possible prognosis after hip fracture.

Results Among 292 participants (42% female; median age 51 [IQR=36-62]), four trajectories were identified, ranging from Trajectory 4 (8.9%; 6+ symptoms) to Trajectory 1 (24.8%; no symptoms). The occurrence of fatigue and myalgia increased among 23% and 12% of participants, respectively. Individuals in Trajectory 4 experienced more negative adjusted B-IPQ scores over time than those in Trajectories 1-3. Conclusions We observed little fluctuation in the total number of symptoms but individual symptoms may develop as others resolve. Reporting a greater number of symptoms was congruent with more negative illness perception over time.",0.673664559

The objective of this study was to investigate the trajectories in pain severity and functional interference following non-catastrophic musculoskeletal (MSK) trauma in an international, mixed injury sample. Methods A prospective longitudinal cohort of n= 241 was formed from patients identified within 4 weeks of trauma, from attendance at emergency or urgent care centres located in London, ON, Canada, or Chicago, IL, USA. Pain interference was measured via the Brief Pain Inventory (London cohort) or the Neck Disability Index (Chicago cohort). Pain severity was captured in both cohorts using the numeric pain rating scale. Growth mixture modeling and RM ANOVA approaches identified distinct trajectories of recovery within pain interference and pain severity data. Results For pain interference, the 3 trajectories were labeled accordingly: Class 1 = Rapid recovery (lowest intercept, full or near full recovery by 3 months, 32.0% of the sample); Class 2 = Delayed recovery (higher intercept, recovery by 12 months, 26.7% of the sample); Class 3 = Minimal or no recovery (higher intercept, persistently high interference scores at 12 months, 41.3% of the sample). For pain severity, the 2 trajectories were labeled: Class 1 = Rapid recovery (lower intercept, recovery by 3 months, 81.3% of the sample); and Class 2 = Minimal or no recovery (higher intercept, flat curve, 18.7% of the sample). The “Minimal or No Recovery” trajectory could be predicted by female sex and axial (vs. peripheral) region of trauma with 74.3% accuracy across the 3 classes for the % Interference outcome. For the Pain Severity outcome, only region (axial trauma, 81.3% accuracy) predicted the “Minimal or No Recovery” trajectory. Conclusions These results suggest that 3 meaningful recovery trajectories can be identified in an international, mixed-injury sample when pain interference is the outcome, and 2 recovery trajectories emerge when pain severity is the outcome. Females in the sample or people who suffered axial injuries (head, neck, or low back) were more likely to be classed in poor outcome trajectories.",0.673277237

Although the outcomes of RHA are often satisfactory, revisions are usually considered when pain intensity is higher than expected. Therefore, it is important to investigate the recovery trajectories of patients following RHA over an extended period and the characteristics that may lead to unfavorable outcomes.The Patient-Rated Elbow Evaluation (PREE) was used to assess recovery in 94 patients at baseline (within 2-7 days after surgery); 3 and 6 months; and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years after RHA. Lower PREE values indicate lower pain and disability. Latent growth curve analysis was used to determine classes of recovery. The characteristics of the participants in the identified recovery trajectory classes were then compared.Two distinct recovery trajectories were identified: optimal and suboptimal recoveries. Most patients (84%) belonged to the optimal recovery class, which exhibited significantly lower baseline PREE scores, a consistent pattern of recovery, and a relatively high rate of change. Patients in the suboptimal recovery class (16%) had significantly higher baseline PREE scores and continued to experience relatively higher levels of pain and disability for the duration of the study; their rate of recovery was much slower. Patients belonging to the 2 recovery trajectories did not differ based on age or sex. Although we had low power in other variables, a qualitative exploration showed that the number of current or previous smokers was higher in the suboptimal recovery trajectory class.In this longitudinal cohort study, we show that high postsurgical pain and disability, and potentially smoking, may adversely affect the recovery trajectory following RHA. Clinicians are recommended to assess these potential factors while considering revision surgeries.Prognostic IV.",0.673004983

Given that middle age links young adulthood to older adulthood and encompasses a variety of changes in roles and status, which influence depression, it is important to understand the changes of depression during this period. Methods: This study used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. The final sample consisted of 834 individuals, and four points in time were used: 34, 36, 40, and 50 years of age. The Latent Growth Model (LGM) was used to estimate the trajectories of depression. Results: The trajectories of depression present a non-linear change, referring to V-shaped curve. The conditional model shows that there are significant individual differences on initial status. Males were negatively associated with the latent initial level of depression. Individuals who showed higher self-esteem and cognitive ability were negatively associated with the latent initial level of depression. In addition, health insurance was negatively associated with the latent initial levels of depression. Both employment and net worth predicted lower intercepts of depression. Discussion: As the 40s is a bridge between the lowest levels of depression and a gradual increase of depression, service providers should be aware of changes of depression among middle-aged adults and spend more time and resources to encourage those individuals to prepare for changes in depression. Prevention programs for depression and providing more opportunities for employment and education to save money should be more focused on young adults.",0.672767133
https://openalex.org/W2921496516,10.1101/568584,Trajectories of change after a health-education program in Japan,"ABSTRACT Background Health education can benefit people with chronic diseases. However, in previous research those benefits were small, and reinforcement to maintain them was not effective. A possible explanation is that the benefits appeared to be small and reinforcement appeared to be ineffective because those analyses mixed data from two latent groups: one group of people who needed reinforcement and one group of people who did not. The hypothesis is that mixing the data from those two different groups caused the true effects to be “diluted.” Methods To test that hypothesis we used data from the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program in Japan, focusing on anxiety, depression, and patient-physician communication. To identify latent trajectories of change after the program, we used growth-mixture modeling. Then, to find out which baseline factors were associated with trajectory-group membership, we used logistic regression. Results Growth-mixture modeling revealed two trajectories – two groups that were defined by distinct patterns of change after the program. One of those patterns was improvement followed by backsliding: decay of impact. On anxiety and depression the decay of impact was large enough to be clinically important, and its prevalence was as high as 50%. Next, logistic regression analysis revealed that being in the decay-of-impact group could be predicted from multimorbidity, low self-efficacy, and high scores on anxiety or depression at baseline. In addition, one unexpected finding was an association between multimorbidity and better patient-physician communication. Conclusions These results support the hypothesis that previous findings (i.e. apparently small effect sizes and apparently ineffective reinforcement) actually reflect “dilution” of large effects, which was caused by mixing of data from distinct groups. Specifically, there was one group with decay of impact and one without. Thus, evaluations of health education should include analyses of trajectory-defined groups. These results show how the group of people who are most likely to need reinforcement can be identified even before the educational program begins. Extra attention and reinforcement can then be tailored. They can be focused specifically to benefit the people with the greatest need.",0.672488303

However, several methodological and interpretational challenges are related to using trajectory analyses. This methodological study aimed to compare results using two different types of software to identify trajectories and to discuss methodological aspects related to them and the interpretation of the results. Methods Group-based trajectory models (GBTM) and latent class growth models (LCGM) were fitted, using SAS and Mplus, respectively. The data for the examples were derived from a representative sample of Spanish workers in Catalonia, covered by the social security system (n = 166,192). Repeatedly measured sickness absence spells per trimester (n = 96,453) were from the Catalan Institute of Medical Evaluations. The analyses were stratified by sex and two birth cohorts (1949–1969 and 1970–1990). Results Neither of the software were superior to the other. Four groups were the optimal number of groups in both software, however, we detected differences in the starting values and shapes of the trajectories between the two software used, which allow for different conclusions when they are applied. We cover questions related to model fit, selecting the optimal number of trajectory groups, investigating covariates, how to interpret the results, and what are the key pitfalls and strengths of using these person-oriented methods. Conclusions Future studies could address further methodological aspects around these statistical techniques, to facilitate epidemiological and other research dealing with longitudinal study designs.",0.67218421

The growth mixture modeling analysis was used to identify latent classes of self-esteem trajectories.Three classes of self-esteem trajectories were identified. The majority of adults (88.0%) reported stable high self-esteem over time. A second class (low-level increasing: 7.7%) reported low levels of self-esteem, which gradually increased to high levels by the end of the study. A third group, medium-level decreasing (4.3%), reported medium self-esteem levels, which decreased to the lowest level by the end of the study.The factors identified in previous studies as those closely associated with self-esteem, such as personality, quality of life, and life satisfaction, were not considered in this study. Additionally, although the absence or presence of chronic disease was included in the health factors, no further investigation was made to identify the effects of different chronic diseases on the dependent and outcome variables.These results suggest that interventions designed to prevent depression among adults who are older, unemployed, at risk of alcoholism, or dissatisfied with their health and relationships may be beneficial.

Participants were children aged 4-5 years recruited in 2004 and followed through to age 16-17 years in 2016, and their caregivers. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to identify groups of children that follow qualitatively distinct developmental trajectories of HRQoL.Three distinct trajectories were identified for the total sample: (1) high-stable (52.2% of children); (2) middle-stable (38.0%); and (3) low-declining (9.8%). These trajectories differed for boys, who saw increasing HRQoL in the highest trajectory group; a middle-stable trajectory; and declining and rebounding HRQoL in the lowest trajectory group. In contrast, girls saw no increasing or rebounding trajectories; approximately half of girls had high-stable HRQoL and the remaining half had either steadily or rapidly declining HRQoL from age 4-5 to 16-17 years.Our results highlight the importance of considering the distinct trajectories for girls and boys and not relying on population mean levels of HRQoL for decision-making. The presence of developmentally distinct trajectories of HRQoL, and differences in the trajectories faced by boys and girls, should be considered when assessing the effectiveness of treatments and interventions impacting upon HRQoL throughout childhood and adolescence. Failure to account for these pre-existing trajectories may over- or under-estimate treatment effects.",0.671070433

Here we present evidence of an additional response pattern: psychological improvement. Female survivors of the Virginia Tech shootings ( N = 368) completed assessments before the shootings and at 2, 6, and 12 months post-shooting. Latent growth mixture modeling revealed distinct trajectories of resilience, chronic distress, delayed distress, continuous distress, and improvement. Although resilience was the most common pattern (56%–59%), a trajectory of substantial improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms also emerged among 13.2% and 7.4% of the sample, respectively. In support of this pattern, improvement was distinctively associated with marked increases in perceived social support and gains in interpersonal resources. Findings suggest a more complex understanding of the impact of mass trauma and a key role for dynamic changes in social support following acute stress.",0.670752855

Little is known about psychological wellbeing and life satisfaction in this group of children, or their coping skills and survival skills in adjusting to these conditions.Our longitudinal study aimed to assess the function of agency in predicting life satisfaction as a moderator for traumatic stress. We reasoned that the more that children show agency over time in activating domains of life satisfaction, the more they can be satisfied with their life and the less they will present signs of trauma. A cross-lagged path model (CLPM) was used to assess 143 children living in Bedouin communities located northeast of Jerusalem (area E1, Al Khan Al-Ahmar). The CLPM, a discrete time structural equation model to analyse panel data in which two or more variables are repeatedly measured at different timepoints, was run in January, 2019 (Time 1) and after 6 months (Time 2). We used the Children's Hope Scale (CHS) as a measure of agency, the Multidimensional Student Life Satisfaction Scale (MSLSS), and the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES).The mean age of participants was 12·02 years (SD 2·05); 65 (46%) were male and 78 (55%) were female. Agency scores had a medium total positive standardised effect on life satisfaction (β=0·25 [95% CI 0·149 to 0·449]; p=0·004) and a small direct standardized effect on trauma symptoms (β=0·08 [0·139 to 0·450]; p=0·023). The indirect effect of agency on trauma was -0·04 (95% CI -0·119 to -0·101]; p=0·044). Life satisfaction had a small statistically significant effect on trauma (β=-0·17 [-0·484 to -0·191]; p=0·037). Statistically significant total standardised effects were found between agency, life satisfaction (β=0·25 [0·161 to 0·476]; p=0·010), and trauma symptoms (β=-0·13 [-0·317 to 0·203]; p=0·044) at Time 1. Similarly, agentic competencies were found to be more related to life satisfaction (β=0·14 [0·025 to 0·338]; p=0·047;) than to trauma symptoms (β=-0·10 [-0·543 to 0·036]; p=0·145) at Time 2. The inclusion of the cross-lagged paths increased the fit of the model significantly.Children are acting for their wellbeing, mobilising personal and contextual resources. Such agentic attitudes contribute to easing their lives under occupation and minimising negative effects on their mental health despite the prevailing chronic traumatic conditions. Children implement skills of resilience rather than yield to the negative effects of political and military violence. The more that children perceive themselves as agentic in activating life satisfaction, the more effectively they deploy their survival skills and resilience.None.",0.67072537

Successful prevention or early detection of postpartum depression will rely on the identification of early risk factors. Pain during pregnancy (before childbirth) is a key potential predictor of postpartum depression risk. However, longitudinal studies characterizing pregnancy pain, its normal trajectory over time, and its prospective relations with symptoms of postpartum depression are lacking.We used data from a longitudinal study of maternal emotion that included assessments of pain and depressive symptoms at 3 time points-during the second and third trimester of pregnancy and at 4 months postpartum. Structural equation modelling was used to estimate longitudinal patterns of change in maternal pain over time. Latent growth curve parameters were tested as predictors of symptoms of postpartum depression.Ninety-three healthy pregnant women enrolled in this study. Although the sample comprised women with relatively low-risk pregnancies, more than 90% of participants experienced pregnancy pain. Greater linear increases and less negative quadratic change in maternal pain over time were associated with greater levels of postpartum depression, even when controlling for prenatal depressive symptoms. Interpreting both parameters together, pain that increased in late pregnancy, when normative patterns had either levelled off or begun to decline, was associated with greater levels of postpartum depression.A developmental trajectory of pain experience that did not subside after childbirth was associated with greater postpartum depressive symptoms, suggesting that atypical trajectories of pain may be a risk factor for postpartum depression.",0.670493992

Hurricane Katrina in 2005 provided an opportunity to study disaster mental health. Less than 5 years after the storm, many Hurricane Katrina survivors were impacted again by the Deepwater Horizon Gulf oil spill. Despite adversities impacting Gulf communities, over 90% of participants reported they were resilient. The purpose of this study was to improve the understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to strengths following adversity in communities affected by repeated disasters. Specifically, we focused on survivor perceptions of personal, spiritual, or community changes in efforts to describe community resilience and posttraumatic growth (PTG).Participants were recruited through a quantitative survey and community flyers. Participants represented southeastern Louisiana, in areas impacted by hurricanes and the oil spill-for a total of five focus groups and 41 participants. Focus groups began by asking each participant to provide a brief overview of their disaster survival story and three additional guiding strengths-based questions. Data were transcribed using Dragon Speech Recognition software. A total of 963 unique responses were analyzed and coded.The following themes were identified: connectedness (n = 259), coping (n = 94), spirituality (n = 60), adaptability (n = 47), and self-reliance (n = 23). Participants noted a growth mindset from the disasters and also acknowledged coinciding negative experiences (n = 154) associated with community change and loss, where subthemes included change in connectedness (n = 97), crime (n = 26), and feeling like an outsider (n = 31).These findings help scholars and mental health practitioners better understand the lived experiences of PTG in a community of survivors impacted by recurring traumatic experiences. In keeping with previous literature, PTG and negative experiences associated with trauma are not mutually exclusive, but occur simultaneously. Our results offer a holistic picture of coping with cumulative or repeated traumas and suggest that connectedness, coping, and spirituality provide important buffers to negative psychosocial outcomes.",0.669618957

We then evaluate candidate GMM models on the basis of a direct measure of success; how well the trajectory types are predicted by clinically and demographically relevant baseline features, which can be viewed as supervised learning. We examine the proposed approach focusing on a particular utility of latent trajectory classes, as outcomes that can be used as valid prediction targets in clinical prognostic models.

For clinical purposes, it would be useful to have knowledge about early indicators of a problematic grief trajectory.Objective: This study aimed to identify classes of bereaved individuals with similar trajectories of PGD symptoms and to design a provisional screening tool including symptoms predicting membership of classes with problematic grief trajectories.Method: In a Dutch sample of 166 bereaved individuals, we conducted a latent class analysis to identify classes of bereaved individuals with similar trajectories of PGD symptoms between two time points (mean of 6 and 18 months post-loss, respectively). Next, we used Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses to examine which symptoms at baseline best predicted membership of classes with problematic grief trajectories.Results: We found four different classes: a class including individuals with persistent high PGD symptoms (class 1, 6%), a class of individuals with persistent moderate PGD symptoms (class 2, 35%), a class of individuals with slightly decreasing moderate PGD symptoms (class 3, 33%) and a class of individuals with persistent low PGD symptoms (class 4, 26%). The endorsement of symptoms ‘yearning’, ‘stunned’, ‘life is empty’ and ‘bitterness’ as present ‘often’ during the preceding month at baseline best-predicted membership of class 1 or 2.Conclusions: Two classes of individuals with problematic grief trajectories were identified.

To examine symptom codevelopment trajectories, we identified latent classes of individuals based on internalizing and externalizing symptoms across ages 3-9 and found three symptom codevelopment classes: normative symptoms (low), severe-decreasing symptoms (initially high but rapidly declining), and severe symptoms (high) trajectories. Next, joint models examined how parenting trajectories overlapped with internalizing and externalizing symptom trajectories. These trajectory classes demonstrated that, normatively, harsh parenting increased after toddlerhood, but the severe symptoms class was characterized by a higher level and a steeper increase in harsh parenting and the severe-decreasing class by high, stable harsh parenting. In addition, a transactional model examined the bidirectional relationships among internalizing and externalizing symptoms and harsh parenting because they may cascade over time in this early period. Harsh parenting uniquely contributed to externalizing symptoms, controlling for internalizing symptoms, but not vice versa. In addition, internalizing symptoms appeared to be a mechanism by which externalizing symptoms increase. Results highlight the importance of accounting for both internalizing and externalizing symptoms from an early age to understand risk for developing psychopathology and the role harsh parenting plays in influencing these trajectories.",0.669269069
https://openalex.org/W3095119698,,The role of resilience resources in predicting post-deployment adjustment: A Longitudinal Study,"Military service members are exposed to life-threatening circumstances and hostile working conditions during deployment. This puts them at risk of developing stress-related psychological health problems after deployment. Recent research has shown that in addition to a short-term symptom increase within the first six months after deployment, there is a subsequent long-term symptom increase at five years after deployment. Currently, there is no clear explanation of why some service members suffer from this delayed onset of stress symptoms, whereas others are able to positively adjust themselves in the long term. The present research focuses on the role of resilience resources before and during deployment as potential predictors of long-term post-deployment adjustment. Resilience can be seen as a process in which internal and external resources interact with demands to result in positive outcomes. We expected that the presence of a diverse set of resources before and during stressful experiences would not only influence short-term outcomes but also long-term adaptation, because of the emergence of resource loss and resource gain cycles (cf. Conservation of Resources Theory). To investigate this, we measured resilience resources using the Dutch Military Resilience Monitor before (n = 786) and during (n = 736) deployment in service members of the Netherlands Armed Forces participating in the NATO ISAF mission and the NATO Anti-Piracy Mission in 2012/2013. Five years later, in 2018, we conducted a follow-up, measuring various indicators of (lack of) adjustment (i.e. quality of life, well-being, post-traumatic stress symptoms, burnout and depression). In this presentation, preliminary results will be discussed.",0.669038493

Traditional mediation methods, which use multiple regression models, cannot appropriately account for other potential pathways from weight to depression, such as bullying, which can result in distorted estimates of the direct effect. Furthermore, most studies use BMI to indicate weight, which can be elevated due to increased muscle mass, so may underestimate the association with depressive symptoms. We aimed to explore the extent to which body dissatisfaction at 14 years mediated the association between childhood weight trajectory and depressive symptoms at 17 years. <h3>Methods</h3> We used data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative longitudinal study of children born around the year 2000. Using Latent Class Growth Analysis, we derived trajectories to age 14 of BMI and of adiposity (relative proportion of Fat Mass to Fat-Free Mass). Participants rated their body dissatisfaction at age 14 (scale 1–7) and completed the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale at age 17. Counterfactual mediation analysis was conducted to estimate total, direct, and indirect effects. <h3>Results</h3> Latent Class Growth Analysis revealed three trajectories of BMI and of adiposity: low, moderate, and high. Counterfactual mediation analysis of participants with valid trajectory data (N=13,025) suggested that compared to those with low BMI trajectories, depressive symptom scores among those with moderate trajectories were 0.29 points higher (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10, 0.49) and in the high trajectory group were 0.60 points higher (95% CI 0.21, 0.99). Using adiposity trajectories, depressive symptom scores in the moderate trajectory group were 0.46 points higher (95% CI 0.25, 0.67) and the high trajectory group were 0.93 points higher (95% CI 0.51, 1.35), compared to those with low adiposity trajectories. The proportion of the association between BMI and depressive symptoms that was mediated by body dissatisfaction was 45%. For adiposity and depressive symptoms, the proportion mediated was 30%. <h3>Conclusion</h3> A large proportion of the association between childhood weight trajectory and depressive symptoms at 17 years old is mediated by body dissatisfaction. Using BMI as a proxy for adiposity may underestimate the association with depressive symptoms. Interventions to improve adolescent body dissatisfaction could reduce depressive symptoms.",0.669031722

For example, teaching at universities has been switched to an online format, reducing students' opportunities for exchange, and social interaction. Consequently, their self-reported mental health has significantly decreased and there is a pressing need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms-ideally considering not only data collected during the pandemic, but also before. One hundred seventeen German university students aged 18-27 were assessed for known resilience factors (optimism, self-care, social support, generalized self-efficacy) and subsequently completed surveys on stress experiences and mental health every 3 months over a period of 9 months before the outbreak of the pandemic and once during the first lockdown in Germany. For each timepoint before the pandemic, we regressed participants' mental health against the reported stressor load, such that the resulting residuals denote better or worse than expected outcomes, i.e., the degree of resilient functioning. We then tested whether different expressions in the resilience factors were predictive of distinct resilient functioning trajectories, which were identified through latent class growth analysis. Finally, we investigated whether trajectory class, resilience factors, and perceived stress predicted resilience during the pandemic. Results show rather stable resilient functioning trajectories, with classes differing mainly according to degree rather than change over time. More self-care was associated with a higher resilient functioning trajectory, which in turn was linked with the most favorable pandemic response (i.e., lower perceived stress and more self-care). Although findings should be interpreted with caution given the rather small sample size, they represent a rare examination of established resilience factors in relation to resilience over an extended period and highlight the relevance of self-care in coping with real-life stressors such as the pandemic.",0.668888747

Methods A community‐dwelling cohort of 1201 individuals with Type 2 diabetes from the Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II was followed for 5 years. The nine‐item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire was administered annually to assess depression symptoms, and biomedical and psychosocial measures were assessed at baseline and biennially. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify classes of depression severity trajectories and associated outcomes, and logistic regression models were used to determine predictors of class membership. Results Three trajectories of depression symptoms were identified: continuously low depression symptoms (85.2%); gradually worsening symptoms that then began to improve (persistent depression – low‐start; 7.3%); and gradually improving symptoms which later worsened (persistent depression – high‐start; 7.5%). Younger age, being a woman, and a lifetime history of major depressive disorder, were associated with greater risk of persistent depression symptoms. Persistent depression was associated with consistently higher BMI over time, but not with changes in HbA 1c or self‐monitoring of blood glucose. Conclusions A subset of individuals with Type 2 diabetes is at risk of depression symptoms that remain elevated over time. Younger, overweight individuals with a history of depression may benefit from early and intensive depression management and ongoing follow‐up as part of routine Type 2 diabetes care.",0.668654867

We aimed to identify trajectories of SA in young adults with depression and/or anxiety, accounting for sociodemographic and occupational factors.Longitudinal study of 1445 twin individuals with elevated depressive/anxiety symptoms in late adolescence or young adulthood (age range: 19-30), assessed in Swedish surveys completed in 2005. Through linkage to nationwide registries, individuals were prospectively followed from 2006 to 2018. The outcome included consecutive annual days of SA, which were analyzed using group-based trajectory modeling. Multinomial logistic regression estimating odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) was used to examine associations of age, sex, and educational level with the resulting SA trajectories.Four distinct SA trajectories were identified in the total sample: 'high-increasing' (6 %), 'low-increasing' (12 %), 'high-decreasing' (13 %), and 'low-constant' (69 %). Increasing age was associated with higher odds of belonging to the low-increasing trajectory (OR = 1.07, 95 % CI = 1.02-1.12). Women had higher odds of belonging to the low-increasing trajectory (OR = 1.67, 95 % CI = 1.10-2.53), compared with men. Higher education was associated with lower odds of belonging to high-increasing (OR = 0.34, 95 % CI = 0.22-0.54) and high-decreasing (OR = 0.59, 95 % CI = 0.43-0.81) trajectories, compared with lower education. Few differences were observed in analyses stratified by occupational sector.Information on potential confounders (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity, work-environment factors) was not available.Among young adults with prior depression/anxiety, close to every fifth showed rising SA trajectories over time.

It remains unclear how distress levels of pregnant and postpartum people have changed (or persisted) as the pandemic continues on and which factors may contribute to these trajectories of distress. Methods This longitudinal study included 304 pregnant people, who were followed during pregnancy, 6-weeks, 6-months and 15-months postpartum. At each time point, a latent “distress” factor was estimated using self-reported depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and stress. Reported negative impact of COVID-19 and social support were assessed during pregnancy as risk and protective factors related to distress. Second-order latent growth curve modeling with a piecewise growth function was used to estimate initial levels and changes in distress over time. Results Mean distress was relatively stable from the pregnancy to 6-weeks postpartum and then declined from 6-weeks to 15-months postpartum. Higher education, greater social support, and lower negative impact of COVID-19 were associated with a lower distress during pregnancy. Unexpectedly, negative impact of COVID-19 was associated with a faster decrease in distress and more social support was associated with a greater increase in distress from pregnancy to 6-weeks postpartum. However, these effects became non-significant after controlling for distress during pregnancy. Conclusion Findings indicate high but declining levels of distress from pregnancy to the postpartum period. Changes in distress are related to social support and the negative impact of the pandemic in pregnancy. Findings highlight the continued impact of COVID-19 on perinatal mental health and the need for support to limit the burden of this pandemic on pregnant people and families.",0.668346387

Group-based trajectory modeling was applied to identify the trajectories of asthma symptom, neighborhood traffic conditions, and neighborhood livability scales (considered for safety and facilities). We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess associations between various neighborhood environmental factors and asthma symptom trajectories.We included 4,174 children from the LSAC cohort in our study. Three distinct trajectories for asthma symptom were the outcome variables of this study. Among the neighborhood environmental factors, we identified two distinct trajectories for the prevalence of heavy traffic on street, and two trajectories of neighborhood liveability scale. Compared to the 'Low/no' asthma symptoms trajectory group, children exposed to a 'persistently high' prevalence of heavy traffic on street was also significantly associated with both 'transient high' [relative risk ratio (RRR):1.40, 95% CI:1.25,1.58) and 'persistent high' (RRR: 1.33, 95% CI:1.17,1.50)] asthma symptom trajectory groups. Trajectory of moderate and static neighborhood liveability score was at increased risk of being classified as 'transient high' (RRR:1.16, 95% CI:1.07,1.25) and 'persistent high' (RRR:1.38, 95% CI:1.27,1.50) trajectories of asthma symptom.Exposure to heavy traffic and poor neighborhood liveability increased the risk of having an unfavourable asthma symptom trajectory in childhood. Reducing neighborhood traffic load and improving neighborhood safety and amenities may facilitate a favorable asthma symptom trajectory among these children.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40201-022-00824-z.",0.668259941

However, limited longitudinal research has evaluated the relations among support and these outcomes among disaster-affected individuals. Design: The current study utilized random intercept cross-lagged panel modeling (RI-CLPM) to examine reciprocal relations among received support, community solidarity, perceived support, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among rural Hurricane Florence survivors (n = 261) assessed 5-8 months post-hurricane (T1), and then at two more timepoints at three-month intervals (T2 and T3). Results: Results of the RI-CLPM supported that lower received support at T2 was associated with decreases in community solidarity at T3, and higher perceived support at T1 was associated with increases in received support at T2. In supplemental analyses, higher received support at T2 was associated with lower PTSD symptoms at T3. Conclusions: Consistent with the SSDM, individuals who receive less support post-disaster are vulnerable to losses in community solidarity and potentially persistent PTSD symptoms. Conversely, those with stronger support networks may be better able to access needed support in the longer-term.",0.668207143

The aim of this study was to classify and characterize patients with moderate-to-severe TBI based on their functional trajectories up to 5 years post-injury. The study included 121 patients with moderate-to-severe TBIs (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10], S06.0-S06.9), 16-55 years of age, and admitted at Trauma Referral Hospital within 24 h of injury between 2005 and 2007. Demographics and injury characteristics were documented at the admission, and functional status was recorded at 3 months and 1 and 5 years post-injury using Functional Independence Measure motor (FIM-M) and cognitive (FIM-C) subscales. We used group-based trajectory models to classify patients' functional trajectories over a 5-year period. For FIM-M, three trajectories were identified: 8.2% of patients showed stable low recovery (13.6 ± 1.5, 17.9 ± 8.8, and 21.0 ± 17.9), 9.2% elevated good recovery (35.8 ± 14.5, 75.5 ± 12.4, and 85.5 ± 8.1), and 82.6% stable good recovery (89.0 ± 3.6, 90.3 ± 1.9, and 90.8 ± 1.0) at the three follow-up points, respectively. For FIM-C, four trajectories were revealed: 4.1% of patients showed stable low recovery (5.0 ± 0, 5.0 ± 0, and 5.0 ± 0), 12.6% delayed moderate recovery (8.9 ± 3.5, 20.6 ± 4.6, and 28.3 ± 3.8), 28.7% elevated good recovery (27.0 ± 3.8, 30.4 ± 7.3, and 31.1 ± 2.3), and 54.6% stable good recovery (32.8 ± 2.3, 34.6 ± 1.0, and 34.7 ± 1.0). The results suggest that three FIM-M and four FIM-C trajectories described various patterns of functional recovery 5 years after moderate-to-severe TBI, with stable good recovery being the most common trajectory. Identifying and characterizing the trajectory memberships should enable targeted rehabilitation programs, inform patient-centered care, and improve long-term outcomes.",0.668187504

Higher levels of loss and/or disruption and prior trauma exposure constitute risk factors for mental illness, whereas protective factors, including hope and resilience, support positive functioning. The present cross‐sectional study used structural equation modeling to examine the relative influence of resilience and hope on mental health and well‐being 1–3 months after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in August 2017, among a sample of 829 adults in the Greater Houston, Texas area. Resilience was more strongly associated with reduced PTSD symptoms, β = −.31, 95% CI [−.42, −.21], than was hope, β = −.17, 95% CI [−;.30, −.04], whereas hope was more strongly associated with components of well‐being, βs = .47–.63. Hope was positively associated with posttraumatic growth, β = .30, 95% CI [.19, .41], whereas resilience was negatively associated with posttraumatic growth, β = −.24, 95% CI [−.35, −.12]. These associations remained consistent after considering risk factors, although more variance in trauma‐related outcomes was risk factors were included in the model. The present results suggest that considering the influence of both risk and resilience factors provides an enhanced picture of postdisaster mental health.",0.668134456

This study aimed to identify latent trajectories of SA in young people with a history of depression and/or anxiety symptoms, while accounting for sociodemographic factors. Methods This was an observational cohort study of 1,445 twin individuals who had elevated depression/anxiety symptoms in late adolescence or young adulthood (age range: 19-30), as assessed in Swedish surveys completed in 2005. Through linkage to the national registries, the individuals were prospectively followed from 2006 to 2018. The outcome included consecutive annual net days of SA, which were analyzed using group-based trajectory modeling with zero-inflated Poisson regression. Multinomial logistic regression estimating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used to examine the influence of age, sex, and educational level on the resulting trajectory groups. Results Four distinct trajectories of SA were identified: ‘high-increasing’ (6%), ‘low-increasing’ (12%), ‘high-decreasing’ (13%), and ‘constant-low’ (69%). The constant-low was used as the reference in all analyses. Increasing age was found to be associated with higher odds of belonging to the low-increasing trajectory (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02-1.12). Women had higher odds of belonging to the low-increasing trajectory (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.10-2.53), compared to men.

Using latent class growth modelling, we identified four trajectories: a stable low imbalance trajectory, which comprised 90% of all participants, and three change trajectories including a decreasing trajectory (4% of the participants), an inverted U-shaped trajectory and an increasing imbalance trajectory, both in 3% of the participants. Results indicate that a sizeable proportion of Swedish employees’ experience imbalance between efforts and rewards at work. The most favourable trajectory comprised relatively more men and was characterised by better work-related characteristics than the less favourable ERI trajectories. All change trajectories were dominated by women and employees in the public sector. Health developments followed ERI trajectories, such that less favourable trajectories associated with impaired health and more favourable trajectories associated with better health.

Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether individual variance in psychological distresses during the early phases post-earthquake would develop different QOL's levels among adolescent survivors 10-year after the Wenchuan earthquake.Data were extracted from the Wenchuan Earthquake Adolescent Health Cohort Study. The current study included 744 adolescent survivors who effectively completed surveys at 6 months, 24 months, and 10 years after the earthquake. Self-report questionnaires were administered to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics, earthquake exposure, life events, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and QOL. Data were analysed using hierarchical multiple regression.Trajectories of psychological distresses were classified as follow: resistance (anxiety 40.73%; depression 54.70%; PTSS 74.46%), recovery (anxiety 17.20%; depression 9.27%; PTSS 10.35%), delayed dysfunction (anxiety 10.35%; depression 18.15%; PTSS 6.18%), and chronicity (anxiety 31.72%; depression 17.88%; PTSS 9.01%). After controlling covariates, hierarchical multiple regression only revealed that the anxiety trajectory with delayed dysfunction remained significantly predictive for four domains of QOL (physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment).The current study highlights the importance of focusing on the variations in trajectories of anxiety symptoms among disaster survivors and providing individualized mental health services to improve survivors' QOL.",0.66789606

(Peace Econ Peace Sci Public Policy 15(2):4, 2009), who estimated the national and regional economic impact of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (WTC). The researchers refined some available data indicating that more than 95 % of the businesses and government offices operating in the WTC area survived by relocating; the vast majority to Mid-town Manhattan or across the river in Northern New Jersey. Had all of these firms gone out of business, the potential direct economic loss in terms of GDP would have been $43 billion. However, relocation was not immediate, taking anywhere from a few days to as long as 8 months for the vast majority of firms. Rose et al. (Peace Econ Peace Sci Public Policy 15(2):4, 2009) calculated this loss in GDP at $11 billion. They were then able to apply the resilience definition provided in this Section to estimate that the effectiveness of relocation as a resilience tactic in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was 72 % ($43 minus $11, divided by $43). This study highlights the importance of excess capacity as a resilience tactic. This more intensive use of resources is also the theme of the recovery in the current great recession in the U.S. and other countries, as employment recovery significantly lacks the recovery of output. The experience of New York thus signals a significant change in approaches to disaster recovery, which typically emphasized prompt rebuilding.

and Education). The latent growth curve model was used to examine the mother’s parenting stress during her child’s
age from 0 to 5 year old. The main results of this study were as follows. First, there was a non-linear increase in
mother’s parenting stress over the course of 5 years. Over time, parenting stress is increased but growth rate is
gradually relaxed. In addition significant individual differences in the trajectories(intercept and slope) were found.
Second, the predictors had significant effects on the trajectory of mother’s parenting stress. The trajectory of mother
with lower self-efficacy, lack of social support and child’s higher emotional temperament showed higher intercept and
increased fast.",0.667455314

This study evaluated trajectories of change for patients with postdisaster posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who were seen in integrated care. In addition to describing the results, this article provides the methods of subgroup analyses as this may be useful for others working in real-world practice.Patients (N = 340) receiving services at 5 rural health clinics self-reported PTSD symptoms as part of an ongoing evaluation to study the effectiveness of integrated health. Analysis of variance was used to assess differences overtime and trajectories were identified with cluster analyses. Disaster and trauma related factors associated with these trajectories were assessed using logistic regression.Significant overall decreases in PTSD symptoms overtime were found; individual trajectories were identified and include stable low, steep declines, stable high symptoms, and increasing symptoms. Stress related to disaster and the number of other traumas patients experienced correctly classified trajectory membership.Trajectories indicate that patients have differing treatment needs and cluster analysis as an evaluation technique may be useful in identifying what treatment works and for whom. The present study addresses a major concern for health care providers serving disaster prone communities and emphasizes the importance of identifying pre incident and disaster related risk vulnerabilities that contribute to mental health outcomes. Subgroup analyses are a useful tool for developing more targeted treatment within integrated care and may be an accessible research strategy for others working in such settings.

Specifically, we examined whether depressive symptoms or sleep quality mediate the relationships between work stressors and these outcomes. Participants were 101 US Navy members who experienced an 8-month deployment after Operational Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom. Using piecewise latent growth models, we found that increased work stressors were linked to increased depressive symptoms and decreased sleep quality across all three deployment stages. Further, increases in work stressors from pre- to post-deployment contributed to poorer sleep quality post-deployment via increasing depressive symptoms. Moreover, sleep quality mediated the association between increases in work stressors and increases in depressive symptoms from pre- to post-deployment. These effects were maintained from post-deployment through the 6-month reintegration. Although preliminary, our results suggest that changes in work stressors may have small, but significant implications for both depressive symptoms and quality of sleep over time, and a bi-directional relationship persists between sleep quality and depression across deployment. Strategies that target both stress and sleep could address both precipitating and perpetuating factors that affect sleep and depressive symptoms.",0.667014143

It examined a secondary data set, the Panel Survey of Employment for the Disabled (PSED), conducted by the Korea Employment Agency for the Disabled (KEAD). Data were gathered over 5 years from individuals with disabilities and analyzed using growth mixture modeling to identify the best QOL trajectory model. Covariates, physical dependence, experience of discrimination, emotional stability, self-esteem, religion, and degenerative type of disability were explored as trajectory predictors. Analysis revealed four latent classes: a high and stable QOL class, a high and varied QOL class, a low and stable QOL class, and a low and varied QOL class. Analysis of predictors indicated degenerative type of disability, physical dependence, discrimination, emotional stability, and self-esteem differentiated the high and stable QOL group from other groups.

Furthermore, we also examined the characteristics of adolescents within different trajectories, with a specific focus on the role of school-related stress.We used three longitudinal waves of questionnaire data collected annually from a sample of Swedish adolescents (n = 1294; Mage = 13.2 [range: 12-15 years], SD = .42; 46.8% girls). Using established measures, the students reported on their sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and perceived school-stress (including stress of school performance, peer and teacher relations, attendance, and school-leisure conflict). We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify adolescents' sleep trajectories, and the BCH method to describe the characteristics of the adolescents in each trajectory.We found four trajectories for adolescents' insomnia symptoms; (1) low insomnia (69%), (2) low-increasing (17%, 'emerging risk-group'), (3) high-decreasing (9%), (4) high-increasing (5%; 'risk-group'). For sleep duration, we found two trajectories; (1) ~8 h sufficient-decreasing (85%), (2) ~7 h insufficient- decreasing (15%; 'risk-group'). Adolescents in risk-trajectories were more likely to be girls and consistently reported higher levels of school stress, particularly regarding school performance and attending school.School stress was prominent among adolescents suffering from persistent sleep problems, especially insomnia, and deserves further attention.",0.666760813

The PASS was categorized into 3 trajectory groups; 1.) Early Recovery (answered yes to PASS at 1 and 6-months), 2.) Delayed Recovery (PASS-yes only at 6-months), and 3.) Unrecovered. Mixed models characterized the trajectory between PASS-groups using SPADI and QDASH disability change scores. Logistic regression identified predictors of Early Recovery versus Delayed+Unrecovered groups.PASS-defined recovery rates by group were Early Recovery (58%), Delayed Recovery (22%), and Unrecovered (20%). A group main effect indicated lower disability over time in the Early Recovery versus Unrecovered (QDASH mean difference = 11(2.4); p = 0.001; SPADI mean difference = 12(3); p < 0.001). The odds of an Early Recovery slightly increased with greater change scores on the SPADI (odds ratio = 1.06, 95%CI:1.02,1.11; p = 0.004) and QDASH (odds ratio = 1.08, 95%CI:1.03,1.13; p = 0.003) over the first month of treatment.Recovery trajectories of patients indicate differing responses to treatment despite overall improvements over the first month of treatment.

Given that depressive symptoms have been associated with weight change following bariatric surgery, identifying and characterizing subgroups with more severe depressive symptoms may have prognostic utility for understanding post-surgical weight loss. This study sought to characterize patterns of change in depressive symptoms and evaluate associations with weight loss in the seven years following bariatric surgery. Participants were 2308 patients who underwent bariatric surgery as part of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study. Depressive symptoms (measured by the Beck Depression Inventory) and weight were assessed annually following surgery. A group-based trajectory model identified six subgroups that evidenced distinct patterns of change in depressive symptoms, with the majority (87.0%) exhibiting stable low to average levels. Generalized linear mixed models indicated trajectory groups differed in percent total weight loss (%TWL), with trajectories characterized by initial decreases in depressive symptoms over the first two years (5.2% of participants) experiencing the highest %TWL (20.7% vs. 14.9–18.4% in the other trajectories at 7 years). Findings demonstrate meaningful heterogeneity in the pattern of changes in depressive symptoms after surgery. While most patients experience relatively low stable levels of depressive symptoms, those who have initial symptom improvement demonstrate the greatest magnitude of weight loss. Further research is necessary to explore the directionality of this association and the time-varying mechanisms by which depression and weight may mutually influence each other.",0.66607822

Perceived negative impact, a form of parental burden, is the degree to which a caregiver reports negative financial, social, and emotional experiences associated with having a child with a disability. This longitudinal study defined parental perceived negative impact trajectory classes across time, determined predictors, and explored the relationship between functional adult outcomes and impact class. Participants ( n = 209) were comprised of caregivers whose child received an ASD diagnosis or had developmental delay. Latent class growth modeling defined three trajectory classes (e.g., low [ n = 68, 32.54%], medium [ n = 98, 46.89%], and high [ n = 43, 20.57%]). Regressions revealed the low impact trajectory class had more caregivers who were racial minorities, less educated, and more socially supported. Membership in the high negative impact class was associated with increased childhood hyperactivity, irritability, autism symptomology, and poor adaptive skills. The low negative impact trajectory class was associated with young adults achieving more functional outcomes. Overall negative impact declined over time all for all classes, though never completely subsided. Possible implications for clinical practices are discussed",0.665611247

However, recent studies indicate that depressive symptoms in the perinatal period do not follow a uniform course, and investigations of the heterogeneity of time courses and associated factors are needed. The aim of this study was to explore whether depressive symptoms in the perinatal period could be categorized into several distinct trajectories of symptom development among subgroups of perinatal women, and to identify predictors of these trajectory groups. The study used data from 1,036 Norwegian women participating in a community-based prospective study from midpregnancy until 12-months postpartum. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at 7 time points (4 during pregnancy). Partner-related attachment, stress, childhood adversities, pregnancy-related anxiety, previous psychopathology, and socioeconomic conditions were assessed at enrollment. By means of growth mixture modeling based on piecewise growth curves, 4 classes of depressive symptom trajectories were identified, including (a) pregnancy only (4.4%); (b) postpartum only (2.2%); (c) moderate-persistent (10.5%); and (d) minimum symptoms (82.9%) classes. Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that membership in the pregnancy only and postpartum only classes primarily was associated with pregnancy-related anxiety and previous psychopathology, respectively, whereas the moderate-persistent class was associated with diverse psychosocial adversity factors. Findings suggest heterogeneity in temporal patterns of elevated depressive mood, relating specific trajectories of time courses with distinct adversity factors. Researchers and clinicians should be aware of possible multiple courses of elevated perinatal depressive mood, and inquire about possible diverse adversity factors, aberrant pathways, and prognoses.

Growth mixture models (GMMs) were used to identify the response trajectories; longitudinal latent class analysis (LLCA) was used to corroborate the findings.Three classes of response were identified for escitalopram and placebo based on the trajectory of the patients' Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores during treatment. All three classes had similar mean baseline MADRS scores, but the change from baseline after 8 weeks differed: -4.2 MADRS points for non-responders, -18.4 MADRS points for slow responders, and -26.7 points for fast responders. The proportions of non-responders, slow responders and fast responders were 53%, 38% and 9%, respectively, with placebo and 27%, 58% and 14%, respectively, with escitalopram. Receiver operating curve analysis showed that a cut-off of ≥43% improvement from baseline to week 2 predicted fast responders, and a cut-off of ≥28% improvement from baseline to week 4 predicted responders (fast or slow). There were no clinically useful differences at baseline that predicted the trajectory class to which a patient would belong.The presence of fast-, slow- and non-responder classes has a clear clinical relevance for guiding treatment decisions; individual patients can be classified by the change in their MADRS score from baseline at 2 or 4 weeks.",0.665077872

Parallel-process latent growth curve modeling was adopted to evaluate the process by which LTA mediated between sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education, self-rated health, comorbidities, and depression) and the outcome process of functional disabilities.When mediated by baseline level of LTA, five sociodemographic factors-age, gender, education level, self-rated health, and number of comorbidities-had significant and negative mediating effects on baseline or change in functional disability, thus improving disability outcomes. However, four of the sociodemographic factors (age, education level, and number of comorbidities), when mediated through the rate of change in LTA, were found to have significant and positive mediating effects, which increased disability levels. The proportion of effects mediated by the LTA trajectory ranged from 0% to 194%.The large proportion of effects mediated through the LTA process underlines the importance of LTA to public health policy and health programs for older adults. The study's findings shed light on how to better target populations of older adults to promote an active lifestyle and achieve more successful aging in late life in Asian countries.",0.664968981

Parents and teachers reported on a SC measure at ages 5, 10, and 12. We tested the existence of different trajectories and whether they discriminated outcomes in early adolescence. The data were collected from different sources, the children, the parents, and teachers, by means of different methods. Using Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM), we identified three distinct social cognition trajectories: persistently mild difficulties reported by parents and teachers (7.9% of the children), stable low problems reported by parents and increased difficulties reported by teachers (10.5% of the sample), and stable low problems reported by both informants for most of the participants (81.5%). Comparison of the psychological outcomes between classes using regression models showed that the two trajectories including children with any level of problems differ from the normative one as regards their association with psychological problems, daily functioning, and variables, such as aggressive behavior and callousness. The two non-normative trajectories also differ from each other in terms of the personal characteristics of the adolescents included in them. Adolescents in the increasing problematic class in the school have a tougher and more problematic style of social relating, while children with persistent and non-context-dependent difficulties are more anxious. These results might help to better detect and design specific interventions for children with deficits in SC that might respond to different personal characteristics leading to different outcomes.",0.664747594

Method Participants were 319 youth (age 7–17 years at enrollment), who participated in a multicenter randomized controlled trial for the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders, Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study , and a 4‐year naturalistic follow‐up, Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Extended Long‐term Study , an average of 6.5 years later. Using growth mixture modeling, the study identified distinct trajectories of anxiety across acute treatment (Weeks 0–12), posttreatment (Weeks 12–36), and the 4‐year‐long follow‐up, and identified baseline predictors of these trajectories. Results Three nonlinear anxiety trajectories emerged: “short‐term responders” who showed rapid treatment response but had higher levels of anxiety during the extended follow‐up; “durable responders” who sustained treatment gains; and “delayed remitters” who did not show an initial response to treatment, but showed low levels of anxiety during the maintenance and extended follow‐up periods. Worse anxiety severity and better family functioning at baseline predicted membership in the delayed remitters group. Caregiver strain differentiated short‐term responders from durable responders. Conclusions Findings suggest that initial response to treatment does not guarantee sustained treatment gains over time for some youth. Future follow‐up studies that track treated youth across key developmental transitions and in the context of changing social environments are needed to inform best practices for the long‐term management of anxiety.",0.664725718

Theoretical models (e.g., Job Demands-Resources Model) state that burnout symptoms develop over time, vary between individuals, and bear adverse consequences. To date, the temporal development of student burnout symptoms within semesters, inter-individual differences in their development, and the role of their development for academic outcomes like student dropout are understudied. To complement this limited research, we used date of a three-wave longitudinal study with N = 1435 undergraduate students over one semester. First, we modeled unconditional second-order latent growth curves to examine the initial levels and trajectories of each burnout symptom (emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy). We then modeled conditional second-order latent growth curves to examine whether initial levels and trajectories differed depending on students’ sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, study progress, and academic major) and associated with students’ intentions to drop out from university. Results indicated a linear increase in student burnout symptoms over the semester. Sociodemographic differences existed in the initial levels of emotional exhaustion and reduced professional efficacy and the trajectories of each symptom. Generally, female, STEM, and higher- and lower- semester students were particularly affected by burnout symptoms. Further, higher initial levels and an increase in each symptom corresponded with higher dropout intentions. Summarizing, the results highlighted that student burnout symptoms increase as the semester progresses, seem more pronounced among certain student groups, and operate as strong predictors for dropout intentions.",0.664652628

Data were from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA) Survey in 1996–2007 (n = 3186). Disability trajectories for activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) were identified by using latent class growth curves modeling. Factors including demographics, health conditions, health behaviors, social relations, and use of assistive devices were significantly predicted different disability trajectories of older adults over the following 11 years by applying hierarchical logistic regression. Three disability trajectories – maintained function, progressive disability, and consistent disability – were identified. Predisposing factors such as younger age, more educational attainment, and better health conditions had protective effects of leading to a later healthier maintained function trajectory. Intra-individual factors such as engaging in leisure time activities (LTAs) were positively related to the maintained function trajectory but negatively related to the consistent disability trajectory; decreasing social networks was common to those on consistent disability trajectory; dissatisfaction with social support was noted in maintained function trajectory group. An extra-individual factor, using assistive devices, was significantly related to maintaining older adults’ disability levels, even for those who started disabled. The findings suggested that predisposing, intra-individual, and extra-individual factors play different roles in the development of later disability trajectories. More educational attainment, better health conditions, active in LTAs, and using assistive devices might benefit the maintenance of functioning in Taiwanese older adults.",0.664219793

A higher risk was also observed for those who started with and maintained raised levels of functional impairment, or depressive symptoms (Class II). Increasing trajectories of functional impairments or depressive symptoms were associated with a higher subsequent risk of dementia, indicating a preclinical manifestation. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring both types of physical limitations (ADL and IADL) as well as emotional states and increase the awareness of the importance of upwards trajectories of functional impairments and depressive symptoms as possible markers for dementia onset.",0.664168161

This study investigated risk and protective factors associated with four trajectories of posttraumatic distress (resilient, recovery, delayed‐onset, chronic) among exposed adults. Participants ( N = 709) completed surveys in 2016–2017 and 2019–2020 assessing mine fire–related particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) exposure; sociodemographic, physical, and mental health variables; and exposure to other traumatic and recent stressful events. Mine fire–related posttraumatic distress was measured using the IES‐R; trajectories were determined according to established clinical significance thresholds. Relative risk ratios ( RRR s) were generated from multivariate multinomial regressions. The resilient trajectory was most common (77.0%). The chronic trajectory (8.5%) was associated with loneliness, RRR = 2.59, 95% CI [1.30, 5.16], and physical health diagnoses, RRR = 2.31, 95% CI [1.32, 4.02].

Latent class growth analysis was conducted on 231 families in a longitudinal investigation (prebirth and 1, 4, 8, and 12 months postbirth) and revealed four classes of families: both mother and father low in depressive symptoms (40.7%); mother high–father low (25.1%); father high–mother low (24.7%), and both mother and father high (9.5%). Families with both mothers and fathers high on depressive symptoms were higher on marital negativity, parenting stress, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems, and lower on marital positivity and parental efficacy than other classes. Children, parents, and marital relationships were more problematic in families with fathers higher on depressive symptoms than in families in which mothers were higher, indicating the significant role of paternal support for firstborn children undergoing the transition to siblinghood. Maternal and paternal depression covaried with an accumulation of family risks over time, no doubt increasing the likelihood of children's problematic adjustment after the birth of their infant sibling.",0.663529143

However, little is known about the development of RTW-SE during the RTW process. In this study, we aimed to identify RTW-SE trajectories in the year following sick leave in employees with MHPs and provided a description of the trajectories in terms of personal and work characteristics, and RTW status. Methods This multi-wave study included 111 employees with MHPs. RTW-SE was measured at baseline, and at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up with the RTW-SE scale for employees with MHPs. Results Latent class growth analysis revealed six trajectories. In three trajectories employees had increasing RTW-SE scores, namely (class 1) low start, moderate increase, (class 3) moderate start, small increase and (class 5) moderate start, steep increase. The other trajectories were defined by (class 2) persistently high, (class 6) persistently low, and (class 4) decreasing RTW-SE scores over time. Employees across the various trajectories differed significantly with respect to RTW status, and personal and work characteristics measured at baseline, including age, gender, and type of MHP. Less favorable trajectories (class 4 and 6) were characterized by higher age, a higher prevalence of anxiety disorder and lower RTW rates. The most favorable trajectory (class 2) was characterized by a higher proportion of stress-related disorders and less major depression diagnoses. Conclusions Large heterogeneity exists in terms of RTW-SE trajectories in employees with MHPs and significant differences were found across the trajectories regarding personal and work characteristics, and RTW status.

With a wide variability in postoperative cardiac symptoms, identification of symptom trajectories during the 3-month postoperative recovery period may improve clinicians' abilities to support symptom recovery.To identify distinct trajectories of cardiac symptoms seen over time in a cohort of patients during the 3-month post-coronary artery bypass grafting period, and determine clinical characteristics associated with different symptom trajectories postoperatively.A prospective trial used the cardiac symptom survey to determine patient symptoms at baseline prior to surgery, and at 1 week, 6 weeks and 3 months following coronary artery bypass grafting. A latent class growth model and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used.Data were obtained from patients ( N=198) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in six medical centres of Taiwan, through patient medical records and interviews. Based on their frequency, trajectories were explored for the six most common postoperative symptoms including angina, dyspnoea, fatigue, depression, sleep problems and anxiety. We identified two to three distinct classes of trajectories for each symptom. Age, longer intensive care unit stay, fewer vessels bypassed, off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, smoking history and lack of regular exercise were associated with worse symptom outcome trends over time.Using this unique trajectories-based research method, we are able to achieve a better understanding of symptom recovery patterns over time among coronary artery bypass grafting patients. Recognising risk factors and potential recovery patterns prior to surgery may allow healthcare providers to deliver targeted discharge planning and individualised care after coronary artery bypass grafting.",0.66336121

The objective of our longitudinal program of research is to examine the trajectories of change in psychosocial skills, resources, resilience, and well-being among adolescent athletes participating in sport programming guided by Canada's Long Term Athlete Development (LTAD) framework. As part of this research, we used latent growth curve modeling to examine psychosocial skills and resources as predictors of well-being and resilience over time. Sixty-eight (23 boys) youth athletes (Mage = 14.80 years at Time 1, SDage = 1.78) completed measures of well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale), resilience (10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale), motivational climate (Motivational Climate for Youth Sports Questionnaire), and psychological skills (Athletic Coping Skills Inventory-28) at three time points, approximately three months apart. Baseline models indicate variability in resilience and well-being over time. Predictive models suggest self-compassion (p=.001) and psychological skills (p=.001) at Time 1 predicted a (positive) rate of change in resilience over the three time points. Self-compassion (p=.008) and psychological skill (p=.008) at Time 1 also predicted a (positive) rate of change in well-being over the same period of time.

We use Finnish population register data to study the kinds of social assistance trajectories found among young adults. We also analyze how individual and family characteristics are associated with the likelihood of following different social assistance trajectories. Individuals are followed from the age of 19 to 25. According to the results, social assistance receipt is relatively common among young adults but spell duration is usually short. Around 35% receive social assistance at least once between the ages of 19 and 25, and 2.5% receive social assistance each year. Using latent class growth analysis, we estimated six trajectories based on the annual number of social assistance months: (1) no receipt; (2) transitory; (3) slow exit; (4) occasional; (5) increase; and (6) dependency. Almost 4% of young adults follow the “dependency” trajectory. The results from multinomial logistic regression indicate that having only a short education is a particularly strong predictor of social assistance dependency. Parental social assistance receipt and moving out of the parental home at a young age are also significant predictors of social assistance receipt.",0.662739336

However, there is limited research on long-term impacts of maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on children's mental health. This study examined how PTSD trajectories of women exposed to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China predicted their children's mental health symptoms 10 years after the earthquake. : 410 dyads of mothers and their adolescent children who exposed to the Wenchuan earthquake were investigated at 12 and 18 months post-earthquake. While the mothers completed measures of earthquake exposure and PTSD symptoms, the children completed measures of earthquake exposure, PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms. In the 10-year follow up, 257 out of the 410 children completed measures of PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms. Data were analyzed using linear regression. : Four trajectories of maternal PTSD symptoms were identified: (a) chronic (9.5%); (b) resilient (66.3%); (c) delayed (7.6%); and (d) recovery (16.6%); More importantly, the findings demonstrated that children whose mothers experienced chronic PTSD reported higher level of PTSD and anxiety symptoms 10 years after the earthquake. : Only two waves of maternal PTSD were collected, self-reported tools other than clinical reviews were used to collect data, and a significant proportion of participants did not respond at the 10-year follow-up. : This study identified maternal PTSD trajectories following the Wenchuan earthquake.

Understanding the trajectories of these will help implement treatments and interventions.This study aims to identify depression and anxiety trajectories in older adults, evaluate the interrelationship of these conditions, and recognize trajectory-predicting characteristics.Group-based dual trajectory modeling (GBDTM) was applied to the data of 3983 individuals, aged 65 years or older who participated in the Korean Health Panel Study between 2008 and 2015. Logistic regression was used to identify the association between characteristics and trajectory groups.Four trajectory groups from GBDTM were identified within both depression and anxiety outcomes. Depression outcome fell into ""low-flat (87.0%)"", ""low-to-middle (8.8%)"", ""low-to-high (1.3%)"" and ""high-stable (2.8%)"" trajectory groups. Anxiety outcome fell into ""low-flat (92.5%)"", ""low-to-middle (4.7%)"", ""high-to-low (2.2%)"" and ""high-curve (0.6%)"" trajectory groups. Interrelationships between depression and anxiety were identified. Members of the high-stable depression group were more likely to have ""high-to-low"" or ""high-curved"" anxiety trajectories. Female sex, the presence of more than three chronic diseases, and being engaged in income-generating activity were significant predictors for depression and anxiety.Dual trajectory analysis of depression and anxiety in older adults shows that when one condition is present, the probability of the other is increased. Sex, having more than three chronic diseases, and not being involved in income-generating activity might increase risks for both depression and anxiety. Health policy decision-makers may use our findings to develop strategies for preventing both depression and anxiety in older adults.",0.662481604

This study explores trajectories of social support and whether depressive symptoms mediate associations between social support trajectories and QoL 10 years after an earthquake.Seven hundred and forty-four Chinese adolescents exposed to the Wenchuan earthquake were surveyed on social support at 6-, 18-, and 24-months and depressive symptoms at 30-months postearthquake (T30m ). They provided valid data on QoL after 10 years of the earthquake (T10y ). The latent class growth analysis was used to estimate social support trajectories. Mediation analysis was then conducted to test whether depressive symptoms at T30m mediated associations between social support trajectories and QoL at T10y .Three trajectories of social support were identified: low decreasing (31.6%), moderate decreasing (55.4%), and persistent high (13.0%) groups. Depressive symptoms significantly mediated the effects of social support trajectories (relative to the low support trajectory) on future QoL (95% CIs: 0.70-1.78 and 1.41-3.37 for moderate decreasing and persistent high groups, respectively).Social support shows individual differences over time. Moderate and high social support trajectories improve 10-year QoL partly by reducing depressive symptoms.

The present study examined trajectories of parenting stress over time and identified modifiable predictors of these trajectories.Parents of youth with epilepsy (N = 102; 2-12 years old) completed questionnaires 1, 4, 13, 19, and 25-months post-diagnosis, including measures of parenting stress, family functioning, child psychosocial functioning, sociodemographics, and perceived stigma. Latent growth curve models (LGCM) were used to examine domains of parenting stress over time.At baseline, 25-48% of parents reported elevated parenting stress. LGCMs revealed that the parent and child domains of parenting stress were generally stable across time. However, life stress was more variable across time, and parents with higher initial life stress had a greater reduction in life stress over time. Socioeconomic status was identified as a non-modifiable predictor of life stress. Family functioning was associated with greater parenting stress in the parent domain. Child psychosocial functioning was associated with greater parenting stress in the parent and child domains.Parenting stress was elevated for a subset of families and appeared to be relatively stable over time, with the exception of life stress, which was more variable. With early screening, child factors and parent appraisals of epilepsy may be valuable targets for clinical intervention with families of children with epilepsy.",0.662272217

Therefore, we characterized subgroups of patients according to their hip function trajectory during the first 6 weeks after THA in a fast-track setting.Patients and methods — 94 patients (median age 65 years [41–82], 56 women) from a single hospital participated in a diary study. Patients recorded their severity of hip problems (Oxford Hip Score, OHS) weekly for 6 weeks after THA. Latent class growth modelling (LCGM) was used to identify patients with the same hip function trajectory and to compare these subgroups on patient characteristics.Results — LCGM revealed a fast (n = 17), an average (n = 53), and a slow (n = 24) recovery subgroup. Subgroups differed on the estimated weekly growth rate during the first 2 weeks (fast: 9.5; average: 5.3; slow: 2.7), with fewer differences between groups in the last 4 weeks (fast: 0.90; average: 2.0; slow: 1.7). Patients in the slow recovery group could be characterized as women of older age (mean age =69) who rated their health as lower preoperatively, needed more assistance during recovery, and were less satisfied with the outcomes of the surgery.Interpretation — We identified distinct recovery trajectories in the first 6 weeks after fast-track primary THA which were associated with patient characteristics.",0.661982612

Accurately recognizing and describing how youth are responding to life adversities is a key step in creating a trauma-informed school. Drawing on various theories, the authors propose 10 trajectories of post-traumatic adjustment. These consist of four trajectories of positive adjustment (<italic>stress resistance, resilient recovery, delayed recovery,</italic> and <italic>growth</italic>) and six trajectories of generally maladaptive adjustment (<italic>decline, delayed decline</italic> [sleeper effects], <italic>distress tolerance, phasic adjustment, severe decline,</italic> and <italic>chronic maladaptive functioning</italic>). The authors then describe key propositions of conservation of resource theory and propose how different resource qualities (e.g., potency, durability, accessibility) can contribute to different adjustment trajectories. They then consider how to use these resource qualities as a problem-solving tool for intervention planning and, more broadly, to help create school environments that steer children and adolescents towards positive post-traumatic adjustment trajectories, including stress resistance, resilient recovery, and growth.",0.661938762

However, little is known about individual differences in the longitudinal reactions to lockdown. We designed a longitudinal study (a) to identify the various trajectories of symptoms of depression and anxiety in the general population during and after lockdown; (b) to determine which positive psychological resources prevent individuals from falling into groups with the most severe trajectories; (c) to test the mediating role of psychological flexibility. We collected and analysed longitudinal data on a sample of French participants ( N = 1399, M age = 43.4; SD age = 12; 87.8% women) during the end of the first lockdown. Participants were asked to report their psychological resources and (in)flexibility at baseline and symptoms of anxiety and depression at each measurment occasion (five weekly observations from 17 March to 11 May 2020, including baseline). Using growth mixture modelling, seven dynamic profiles of symptoms were identified: four for depression and three for anxiety. Resilience emerged as the most frequent trajectory. Wisdom, optimism, hope, self-efficacy and peaceful disengagement significantly prevented individuals from belonging to the symptomatic groups. Moreover, psychological flexibility emerged as a significant mediator of these effects. This study highlights the importance of cultivating protective factors and psychological flexibility to prevent mental health damage during potentially traumatic events (PTE) and to favour resilience trajectories.",0.661743338

Nevertheless, previous studies pointed out that in trauma living with a life-threatening illness, they may be experienced as two independently and share distinct predictors. In our study we aimed to find the different trajectories of PTG and PTD among a sample of people living with HIV (PLWH) and to investigate its predictors out of psychological resilience, and gain and loss of resources from the conservation of resources theory (COR). Methods We designed a longitudinal study that consisted of three measurements at 6-month intervals, and we recruited, respectively, 87, 85 and 71 PLWH. Each time participants filled out the following questionnaires: the expanded version of the PTG and PTD Inventory (PTGDI-X), the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), the Conservation of Resources Evaluation (COR-E), and a survey on sociodemographic and medical data. Results We observed two separate trajectories of PTG and PTD within participants and found that each of the trajectories were related to different predictors from the studied variables. More specifically, we found a positive relationship between resilience and a descending PTD trajectory that stabilized over time. Gain of resources generally predicted a PTG trajectory, while loss of resources predicted the dynamics of PTD. Conclusions Including two parallel constructs, i.e., PTG and PTD, confirmed the independence of their mechanisms in growth processes among PLWH. The initial insight concerning the role of resilience and resources in PTG/PTD processes may inspire more effective planning for psychological help for PLWH, and it may stimulate studies on growth after trauma to further examine the two sides of this phenomenon.",0.661629957

In total, 2686 veterans treated for PTSD between 2002 and 2015 across 14 hospitals in Australia completed the PTSD Checklist at intake, discharge, and 3 and 9 months follow-up. Predictor variables included co-morbid mental health problems, relationship functioning, employment and compensation status.Five distinct classes were found: those with the most severe PTSD at intake separated into a relatively large class (32.5%) with small change, and a small class (3%) with a large change. Those with slightly less severe PTSD separated into one class comprising 49.9% of the total sample with large change effects, and a second class comprising 7.9% with extremely large treatment effects. The final class (6.7%) with least severe PTSD at intake also showed a large treatment effect. Of the multiple predictor variables, depression and guilt were the only two found to predict differences in response trajectories.These findings highlight the importance of assessing guilt and depression prior to treatment for PTSD, and for severe cases with co-morbid guilt and depression, considering an approach to trauma-focused therapy that specifically targets guilt and depression-related cognitions.",0.660771558

The number of distinct language trajectories was examined using latent growth mixture modeling allowing for linear and quadratic time trends. Potential predictors in the neonatal period (eg, birth group, sex, and medical risk) and at 2 years (ie, social risk and use of allied health services) for the language trajectories were tested using multinomial logistic regression. Results Five distinct language trajectories were identified across childhood: stable normal (32% of study cohort), resilient development showing catch-up (36%), precocious language skills (7%), stable low (17%), and high-risk (5%) development. The very preterm group was 8 times more likely to have a language trajectory that represented poorer language development compared with full term controls (very preterm, 40%; full term, 6%). Greater social risk and use of allied health services were associated with poorer language development. Conclusions Variable language trajectories were observed, with a substantial proportion of children born very preterm exhibiting adverse language development.

In the current study, trajectories of anxiety and depression symptoms (1.5-10 years) were related to children's broader psychosocial and school-related functioning at 10 years. We included a population-based sample of 7499 children, for whom primary caregivers reported anxiety and depression symptoms on the Child Behavior Checklist, at children's ages of 1.5, 3, 6, and 10. Growth Mixture Modeling identified four distinct, gender-invariant, trajectories of anxiety and depression symptoms: low (82.4%), increasing (7.4%), decreasing (6.0%), and increasing symptoms up to age 6 followed by a decrease to age 10 (preschool-limited, 4.2%). Children with a non-Dutch ethnicity had lower odds to be in the increasing trajectory and higher odds to be in the decreasing and pre-school limited trajectory. Also, low maternal education predicted the decreasing and pre-school limited trajectory. Higher levels of psychopathology during pregnancy for both mothers and fathers predicted the increasing, decreasing, and preschool-limited trajectory, compared to the low trajectory. At age 10, children in the increasing and preschool-limited trajectory had diminished psychosocial outcomes (friendship-quality and self-esteem) and worse school-related outcomes (school performance and school problems). This study adds to current knowledge by demonstrating that developmental patterns of anxiety and depression symptoms in early childhood are related to broader negative outcomes in middle childhood. Child and family factors could guide monitoring of anxiety and depression symptoms in the general population and provide targets for prevention programs.",0.660289463

However, little is known about psychological distress trajectories amongst injury survivors in low- and middle-income countries.Methods: Adult injury patients (n = 644) admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, were enrolled and interviewed in the hospital, and at 1, 2-3, and 4-7 months after hospital discharge through phone to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms and level of disability. Growth mixture modeling was applied to identify latent trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms.Results: Elevated depressive and moderate-level anxiety symptoms (13%) and low depressive and anxiety symptoms (87%) trajectories were found between hospitalization and up to seven months after hospital discharge. Being female, prior trauma experience, longer hospitalization, worse self-rated health status while in the hospital, and lack of monetary assistance during hospitalization were associated with the elevated symptoms trajectory. The higher symptoms trajectory associated with higher disability levels after hospital discharge and significantly lower proportion of resuming daily activities and work.Conclusion: The persistence of elevated depressive symptoms and associated reduced functioning several months after physical injury underscores the importance of identifying populations at risk for preventive and early interventions.Implications for RehabilitationHealth providers following up with injury survivors should screen for depressive and anxiety symptomsSpecial attention to women and people with a potential traumatic exposure historyIncorporation of evidence-based culturally adapted psychosocial interventions in rehabilitation and outpatient clinics.",0.659377579

Using data from a cohort of participants ( n = 194), most of whom were first assessed for ASD in very early childhood, we investigated the trajectories of co-occurring depressive, anxiety, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms from late childhood to adulthood. Additionally, childhood predictors and adult outcomes associated with these symptom trajectories were examined. Using group-based trajectory modeling, we found two distinct classes of individuals exhibiting each of these co-occurring symptom patterns: one class exhibited fairly low symptoms across time, and one class with elevated symptoms with varied fluctuation across time (ADHD symptoms starting high but decreasing, anxiety symptoms high and stable, and depressive symptoms fluctuating but peaking at clinically significant levels in young adulthood). All high trajectory classes were associated with age 9 adaptive skills; verbal IQ predicted higher anxiety and depressive symptom classes. After accounting for verbal IQ, all high symptom trajectory classes were negative predictors of objective adult outcomes. These findings call for wide-ranging considerations of the needs of individuals across ability levels, autism symptoms, and behavioral and emotional challenges.",0.659341626

Soldiers (N = 1,222) completed the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) and a measure of PTSD symptoms prior to deploying to Afghanistan (Time 1) and measures of combat exposure and social connection immediately after the deployment (Time 2). Soldiers then completed measures of PTSD symptoms at 3 months (Time 3) and 10-12 months (Time 4) following the deployment. Within the context of the Conservation of Resources (COR) model, perceived resilience and social connection represented personal and social resources that allow military personnel to demonstrate better mental health when confronted with the traumatic stressor of combat exposure. Perceived resilience prior to the deployment interacted with combat exposure to predict PTSD symptoms at Time 3 and Time 4 after controlling for baseline PTSD symptoms. Perceived resilience was more strongly related to PTSD symptoms under higher levels of combat exposure. Moderated mediation models provided support for social connection as a mediator of the relationship between perceived resilience at baseline and PTSD symptoms at Time 3 and 4 under higher levels of combat exposure. The results provide some of the first empirical evidence regarding the predictive value of perceived resilience prior to potentially traumatic exposure and document social connection as an important resource linking perceived resilience to positive adaptation after adversity.

A large, national dataset was leveraged to identify and broadly characterize trajectories from toddlerhood through adolescence, which is crucial for timely, targeted interventions.Data on irritability and a broad array of potential factors affecting irritability development from 4,462 children assessed longitudinally at ages 3, 5, 9, and 15 were included. Latent class growth models identified groups of children based on their nonlinear irritability trajectories from toddlerhood to adolescence. LASSO regression then identified key characteristics differentiating trajectory groups.Five distinct irritability trajectories were identified, two of which were stable, maintaining medium or high irritability from age 3 to 15. Three trajectories showed undulating change over development, with an inflection point at the transition to adolescence (age 9): Most children had consistently low irritability. Two smaller groups started with high irritability at age 3 but diverged, sharply decreasing or increasing until a turning point at age 9. Developmental patterning of harsh/neglectful parenting and child internalizing symptoms most strongly differentiated trajectory groups. Sociodemographic characteristics, attachment style, neighborhood support, cognitive functioning, and genetic variation also differentiated trajectories.The results demonstrated the importance of the transition to adolescence as a critical inflection point for youths with fluctuating irritability trajectories.

A total of 599 Flemish adolescents aged 12–18 at Time 1 (41.3% female; Mage = 14.93) participated at three annual measurement points. Five identity trajectory classes emerged using latent class growth analysis (achievement, foreclosure, moratorium, carefree diffusion-increasing exploration, troubled diffusion). In addition, multigroup latent growth curve modeling demonstrated the co-development of identity trajectory classes with psychopathology. Adolescents in classes reflecting maladaptive identity functioning, such as moratorium and troubled diffusion, displayed significantly more psychopathological symptoms. These findings indicate the importance of targeting identity functioning in the prevention and intervention of psychopathology among adolescents.",0.658681118

The sample featured 486 respondents who had at least one migrant adult children at all four waves. Growth mixture modeling was used to investigate the trajectory classifications of depressive symptoms from 2001 to 2009 and antecedents in differentiating among class memberships.Results: The findings suggested a two-class model to interpret depressive symptom trajectory patterns: persistently high symptoms and low but increasing symptoms. Older adults who had better intergenerational relationships at baseline were more likely to have low but increasing depressive symptoms after controlling for other covariates.Discussion: The findings suggest that intergenerational relationships have long-term impacts on depressive symptom trajectory classes. Policy and intervention implications are discussed.",0.658418536

These findings offer theoretical and practice implications regarding posttraumatic growth in breast-cancer patients by distinguishing between profiles of adaptation and highlights a previously unidentified profile-struggling growth. These results contribute to the theoretical understanding of the complex relationship between growth, distress, and coping. (PsycINFO Database Record",0.658145163

The current study is the first to explore subgroups of disaster-bereaved individuals based on presence of psychopathology clusters. This may inform the development of diagnostic instruments and tailored interventions.Objective: Aims of the current study were to examine (1) subgroups based on presence of prolonged grief disorder (PGD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters and (2) associations between class membership, disaster-related variables (i.e. experiencing multiple losses, conducting multiple burials for the same deceased, and time to confirmation of death), and a sense of unrealness.Method: Self-rated PGD (10 items of the Traumatic Grief Inventory represented in two symptom clusters), MDD (16-item Quick Inventory Of Depressive Symptomatology represented in one symptom cluster), and PTSD (20-item PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 represented in four symptom clusters) from 167 participants were subjected to latent class analysis to identify subgroups (i.e. classes). Correlates of class membership were assessed using the three-step approach.Results: A three-class solution yielded the best model fit. Class 1 (Resilient class; 20.0%) was predominantly characterized by low probability of PGD, MDD, and PTSD symptom clusters, class 2 (PGD class; 41.8%) by moderate to high probability of presence of PGD, and class 3 (Combined class; 38.2%) by moderate to high probability of presence of PGD, MDD, and PTSD symptom clusters. Compared with the Resilient class, a sense of unrealness was more likely to be experienced by individuals in the PGD class and the Combined class.Conclusions: Our results indicate that subgroups of disaster-bereaved individuals can be distinguished based on the presence of PGD, MDD, and PTSD symptom clusters.

Methods Group‐based trajectory modeling was applied to the sexual functioning of 896 women diagnosed with stage I‐IV breast cancer at age 40 or younger. The Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System was used to evaluate women's symptoms of sexual dysfunction annually for 5 years. Results Five distinct trajectories of sexual functioning were identified: one asymptomatic, one minimally symptomatic, two moderately symptomatic, and one severely symptomatic trajectory. Twelve percent of women were asymptomatic throughout follow‐up. The plurality of women experienced stable mild symptoms (42%). Among those with moderate symptoms, some experienced improvement over time (22%) while others experienced deterioration (13%); 11% experienced stable severe symptoms that did not remit over time. Independent predictors of experiencing a symptomatic rather than asymptomatic trajectory ( P &lt; 0.05, two‐sided) included diagnosis with stage 2 versus 1 disease, ER positive disease treated with oophorectomy or ovarian suppression, being partnered, having anxiety, poorer body image, and greater musculoskeletal pain. Conclusions We identified distinct trajectories that describe the reported sexual symptoms in this cohort of young breast cancer survivors. The majority of women reported various degrees of sexual dysfunction that remained stable over the study period.

Therefore, we aimed to explore the associations between the trajectories of depressive symptoms during pregnancy and risk of PTB. In total, 7732 pregnant women were included in 24 hospitals from 15 provinces of China. The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to evaluate depressive symptoms in the first, second, and third trimesters. Associations between depressive symptoms and risk of PTB were performed by group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM), propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), and logistic regression. GBTM identified five trajectories: compared with persistently low-stable trajectory of depressive symptoms, women with moderate-stable (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02-1.76), high-falling (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.11-2.21), moderate-rising (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.06-2.04), and high-stable trajectory of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.16-3.28) had an increased risk of PTB. In addition, the associations between trajectories of depressive symptoms and risk of PTB were most significant in multiparous women with a history of PTB. There was no difference in the risk of early-moderate PTB among different trajectories of depressive symptoms and only the risk of late PTB was different among different trajectories. In conclusion, the depressive symptoms of pregnant women were not constant during pregnancy, and different trajectories of depressive symptoms were associated with different risks of PTB.",0.657401501

Latent transition analysis was then used to examine individuals' probabilities of transitioning into each latent class at Time 2 based on their latent class membership at Time 1.A four-class model emerged as the best fitting model at both Time 1 and Time 2. Classes demonstrated overall severity and symptom cluster severity differences. Transition into a lower severity class was more common than transition into a higher severity class, though escalation was demonstrated by 6-20% of participants in each latent class.The substantial heterogeneity in sexual assault survivors' PTSD symptoms highlights the variety of ways that posttraumatic stress may be experienced years after a sexual assault.

The present longitudinal study examined the development of eating disorder symptomatology in adolescents over two years. At Time 1,528 high school students filled out self-report questionnaires (50.5% female; Mage = 15 years). Multivariate latent growth curve modeling and latent class growth analyses were performed to model latent trajectories and to identify latent trajectory classes. Stable trajectories of drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction were found, whereas bulimia and BMI increased over time. Important gender differences pointed to girls experiencing more eating disorder symptoms at each time point. Additionally, more diverse trajectory classes were found in girls than in boys. Finally, classes with the most eating disorder symptoms also experienced the most problems in identity development, internalizing symptoms, and the least effortful control. The present study underscores the importance of identifying vulnerable adolescents that experience greater eating disorder symptomatology, as they also seem to experience the worst psychosocial development.",0.657059901

Methods Latent growth mixture models are conducted with small example dataset of N = 117 pediatric patients using Mplus software. Results The example and data show how to select a solution, here a 3-class solution. We also present information on two methods for incorporating covariates into these models. Conclusions Many studies in pediatric psychology seek to understand how an outcome changes over time. Mixed models or latent growth models estimate a single average trajectory estimate and an overall estimate of the individual variability, but this may mask other patterns of change shared by some participants. Unexplored variation in longitudinal data means that researchers can miss critical information about the trajectories of subgroups of individuals that could have important clinical implications about how one assess, treats, and manages subsets of individuals. Latent growth mixture modeling is a method for uncovering subgroups (or “classes”) of individuals with shared trajectories that differ from the average trajectory.",0.656639897

Using an unadjusted spatial scan statistic, we detected clusters of elevated risk of PTSS trajectories, but not depression trajectories, on Galveston Island. We then tested for predictors of membership in each trajectory of PTSS and depression (e.g., demographic variables, trauma exposure, social support), not taking the geographic nature of the data into account. After adjusting for significant predictors in the spatial scan statistic, we noted that spatial clusters of PTSS persisted and additional clusters of depression trajectories emerged. This is the first study to show that longitudinal trajectories of postdisaster mental health problems may vary depending on the geographic location and the individual- and community-level factors present at these locations. Such knowledge is crucial to identifying vulnerable regions and populations within them, to provide guidance for early responders, and to mitigate mental health consequences through early detection of mental health needs in the population. As human-made disasters increase, our approach may be useful also in other regions in comparable settings worldwide.",0.656538037

As a follow-up, we examined the impact of pre- and postdisaster social support on longer-term of mental health—both psychological distress and posttraumatic stress. In this three-wave longitudinal study, 492 residents in the region affected by Hurricane Katrina reported levels of perceived social support and symptoms of psychological distress prior to the storm (Wave 1). Subsequently, one year after Hurricane Katrina (Wave 2), they reported levels of exposure, perceived social support, and symptoms of psychological distress and posttraumatic stress. The latter three variables were assessed again four years after the hurricane (Wave 3). Results of mediation analysis indicated that levels of exposure to hurricane-related stressors mediated the relationship between Wave 1 perceived social support and Wave 3 psychological distress as well as postdisaster posttraumatic stress. Results of regression analyses indicated that, controlling for Wave 1 psychological distress and disaster exposure, Wave 2 perceived social support was associated with Wave 2 and Wave 3 psychological distress but not posttraumatic stress. Our results confirmed the social causation processes of social support and suggest that posttraumatic stress might not stem directly from the lack of social support. Rather, preexisting deficits in social resources might indirectly affect longer-term posttraumatic stress and general psychological distress by increasing risk for disaster-related stressors.",0.656114651

However, it is less well understood how working over the long term in successive COVID-19 waves affects staff well-being. Aims To identify subpopulations within the health and social care staff workforce with differentiated trajectories of mental health symptoms during phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method The COVID-19 Staff Wellbeing Survey assessed health and social care staff well-being within an area of the UK at four time points, separated by 3-month intervals, spanning November 2020 to August 2021. Results Growth mixture models were performed on the depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder longitudinal data. Two class solutions provided the best fit for all models. The vast majority of the workforce were best represented by the low-symptom class trajectory, where by symptoms were consistently below the clinical cut-off for moderate-to-severe symptoms. A sizable minority (13–16%) were categorised as being in the high-symptom class, a group who had symptom levels in the moderate-to-severe range throughout the peaks and troughs of the pandemic. In the depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder models, the high-symptom class perceived communication from their organisation to be less effective than the low-symptom class.

Although both drugs show better outcomes than placebo, not all patients benefit from treatment. We examined predictors and latent classes of SSRI treatment response in patients with PTSD. Symptom severity was measured over a 12-week period in 390 patients suffering from PTSD treated with open-label sertraline or paroxetine and a double-blinded placebo. First, growth curve modeling (GCM) was used to examine population-level predictors of treatment response. Second, growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to group patients into latent classes based on their treatment response trajectories over time and to investigate predictors of latent class membership. Gender, childhood sexual trauma, and sexual assault as index trauma moderated the population-level treatment response using GCM. GMM identified three classes: fast responders, responders with low pretreatment symptom severity and responders with high pretreatment symptom severity. Class membership was predicted based on time since index trauma, severity of depression, and severity of anxiety. The study shows that higher severity of comorbid disorders does not result in an inferior response to treatment and suggests that patients with longer time since index trauma might particularly benefit from treatment with sertraline or paroxetine.",0.655627794

Depressive symptoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression scale at one, three, six, 13, 18, and 24 months after loss (Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression scores ≥16 indicate severe depressive symptoms). Distinct depressive symptom trajectories and their predictors were identified by latent-class growth analysis.ResultsWe identified five depressive symptom trajectories (prevalence): endurance (47.2%), resilience (16.7%), transient reaction (20.2%), prolonged symptomatic (11.7%), and chronically distressed (4.2%). Over two years after loss, the endurance group never experienced severe depressive symptoms. Severe depressive symptoms lasted six, seven to 12, and 18 months for the resilience, transient-reaction, and prolonged-symptomatic groups, respectively. The chronically distressed group's severe depressive symptoms persisted. The endurance and chronically distressed groups had the best and weakest psychological resources, respectively. Endurance-group caregivers perceived the greatest social support, whereas the resilience and transient-reaction groups had higher social support than the prolonged-symptomatic group.ConclusionsMost (84.1%) caregivers' depressive symptoms subsided within one year after loss. Preloss psychosocial resources predicted depressive symptom trajectories for bereaved caregivers. Health care professionals can help caregivers adjust their bereavement by providing support to enhance their sense of coherence and encouraging social contacts while they are providing end-of-life care.",0.655580403

Associations between exposure to postnatal depression and negative child outcomes underscore the importance of understanding trajectories and correlates of perinatal depression and anxiety. : In a study of 438 expectant couples (from the UK, USA and Netherlands) tracked across four time-points (third trimester, 4, 14 and 24 months), we used dyadic latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) of self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression (CES-D, GHQ, STAI) to investigate the affective impact of becoming a parent. : Confirmatory factor analyses of anxious-depressive symptoms revealed a single latent factor with measurement invariance across time and parent. Dyadic LGCM intercepts showed greater prenatal problems in mothers compared with fathers. LGCM slopes revealed stable maternal problems but worsening paternal problems. Both intercepts and slopes showed significant within-couple associations. Controlling for prenatal salivary cortisol levels and perinatal couple relationship quality, support from friends attenuated mothers’ psychological distress and support from family reduced fathers’ psychological distress across the transition to parenthood. : Our sample was low risk (i.e., predominantly well-educated and affluent and no history of serious mental illness), limiting the generalizability of findings. In addition, the inverse association between psychological distress and social support may, in part, reflect the use of self-report for both measures. : The international dyadic longitudinal design strengthens conclusions regarding variation in trajectories of psychological distress in both mothers and fathers.

Less is known about this association over time.The aim of this study is to determine whether or not social adversity experienced by pregnant women is associated with their patterns of depressive symptoms over their reproductive life course.Data were obtained from a cohort of women collected at their first obstetrical clinic visit of an index pregnancy (time-point 1) and at a further six time-points to 27 years following the birth. Latent Class Growth Modelling was used to estimate trajectories of women's depressive symptoms over this time period. Logistic regression modelling determined the prospective association between measures of adversity in pregnancy and 27-year postpartum depression trajectories, controlling for potential confounders.Experiencing financial problems, housing problems, serious disagreements with partners and with others, and experiencing serious health problems in pregnancy were associated with membership of high and middle depression trajectories over the 27 years. Having someone close die or have a serious illness was associated with the high depression trajectory only. Younger maternal age and low family-income at first clinic visit were also associated with an increased risk of women's membership of both high and middle depression trajectories.Experiencing adversity during pregnancy predicts subsequent patterns of maternal depression over an extended period of women's reproductive life course. It is not clear whether women's experiences of adversity during pregnancy were causally associated with subsequent depression or whether there are other explanations of the observed association.",0.655347981

The latent growth mixture model (LGMM) is an extension of LGM with introducing latent classes in the model specification and statistical inference for modeling the developmental trajectory of individuals.

For the Basic Mobility/C and Wheelchair Mobility/AT domains, models specifying 2 trajectory groups were selected. For both domains, a majority class exhibited average functional levels and gradual improvement, primarily in the first 6 months. A smaller group of individuals made gradual improvements but had greater initial functional limitations. The Self Care/C domain exhibited a similar pattern; however, a third, small class emerged that exhibited substantial improvement in the first 6 months. Finally, for individuals with tetraplegia, trajectories of Fine Motor Function/C scores followed 2 patterns, with individuals reporting generally low initial scores and then making either modest or large improvements. In individual growth curve models, injury/demographic factors predicted initial functional levels but less so regarding rates of recovery.Trajectories of functional recovery followed a small number of change patterns, although variation around these patterns emerged. During the first 2 years after initial hospitalization, SCI-FI scores showed modest improvements; however, substantial improvements were noted for a small number of individuals with severe limitations in fine motor and self-care function.

Especially, body recovery duties and nuclear disaster response were known as challenging missions that can induce severe adverse psychological responses for a long time. The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE), an unprecedented complex disaster (i.e., earthquake/tsunami/nuclear accident), provided us with a unique opportunity to explore these risk factors and their relative influence for PTSD. 

Methods: Of approximately 70 000 eligible Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) first responders, 56 388 enrolled in this 6-year prospective cohort study. The data were collected at eight time points: one, six, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months post-mission completion. The Impact of Event Scale–Revised assessed PTSD symptoms; scores of ≥25 were defined as probable PTSD. Professional disaster experience (i.e., duties with body recovery or radiation exposure risk), sociodemographic factors (e.g., disaster–victim status) and working conditions (e.g., deployment length) were investigated. Cox proportional hazard models assessed the risk factors for incidences of probable PTSD. 

Findings: The cumulative incidence of probable PTSD was 6·75%. The classes categorized by baseline severity of PTSD symptoms demonstrated a high degree of rank-order stability over time. Rather than professional disaster experience, sociodemographic factors and working conditions showed strong independent association with the incidence of probable PTSD: disaster-victim status (hazard ratio [HR]=1·96; 95% CI 1·72-2·24), deployment length of ≥3 months (vs. <1 month; HR=1·75; 95% CI 1·52-2·03), older age (≥46 vs. ≤25 years; HR=2·28; 95% CI 1·79-2·91), and post-deployment overwork of ≥3 months (vs. little to none; HR=1·61; 95% CI 1·39-1·87). 

Interpretation: In the future, first responders’ PTSD symptoms might be mitigated by shortening deployment length, avoiding post-deployment overwork, and paying special attention to personnel with disaster-victim status or older age. Efforts to alleviate responders’ initial symptoms will be required.

Separate linear growth mixture models were estimated across 12 months of follow-up to identify longitudinal trajectories of suicidal ideation and depression symptoms. Predictors of latent class membership were tested using logistic regression models.Two-class models were found to have optimal fit for both suicidal thinking and depressive symptoms. Trajectory classes of suicidal ideation were: (1) moderate severity decreasing over time; and (2) high severity remaining stable over time. Depression trajectories were: (1) moderate severity with a small decrease over time; and (2) high severity that decreased moderately over time. Lower perceived burdensomeness was associated with having a greater decrease in both suicidal thinking and depression. More severe mental health symptoms were associated with less decrease in depression symptoms but not with suicidal ideation trajectory.Class membership across the two outcomes and predictors of class membership were found to be largely independent. The lack of coupling in trajectories and predictors suggests that changes in suicidal thinking may occur independently of changes in depression.",0.65473586

Community-dwelling participants with a first hospitalization occurring after any annual survey were included (N = 937). Monthly total cost trajectories were constructed for the 3 months before and 3 months following hospitalization. Growth mixture models identified groups of patients with similar trajectories. The association of cost classes with five functional outcomes was examined using multivariate models, controlling for pre-hospitalization function and lead time.Four cost trajectory classes describing common recovery patterns were identified-persistently high, persistently moderate, low-spike-recover, and low variable. Cost class membership was significantly associated with change in Activities of Daily Living (ADL), instrumental ADL, Short Physical Performance Battery, and grip strength (p < 0.005), but not gait speed (p = 0.08). The proportion of patients who maintained or improved SPPB score was 46.8% in the persistently high, 49.2% in the persistently moderate, 52.7% in the low-spike-recover, and 57.2% in the low-variable groups. In models adjusted for known predictors of functional outcome, the magnitude and direction of association was maintained but significance was lost, indicating that cost trajectories' mirror is mediated by predictors of recovery not available in administrative data.Cost trajectories and total costs are associated with functional recovery following hospitalization in older adults. Cost may be useful as a measure of recovery in administrative data.",0.654245021

We assessed post-flood mental health longitudinally in three groups of mostly middle-aged and older adults who varied in current and prior severe weather experiences.Method Predictors of central interest were age, perceived social support, state hope (including agency and pathways), recovery stressors, and prior lifetime trauma. Criterion variables included symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and worry.Results Analyses of variance yielded significant Disaster Exposure Group x Wave interactions for depression and PTSD symptoms. Those with flooded homes and properties had elevated symptoms at Wave 1 which were reduced at Wave 2. Older age was associated with fewer symptoms of depression, PTSD, and worry. Recovery stressors and lifetime trauma predicted more PTSD symptoms. Greater agency predicted less PTSD and depression symptoms, whereas pathways predicted less worry.Conclusion These data show that mental health symptoms may decrease over time for those directly impacted by severe flooding. State hope appears to contribute to better mental health after exposure to a devastating flood. Implications for understanding the dynamic relationships among risk variables and positive factors that promote post-disaster mental health in the years after a flood are considered.",0.653530286

With recent increases in violence in some cities, understanding the impact of exposure to violence on these beliefs is important. The present study examined whether witnessing severe community violence during early adolescence was associated with trajectories of control-related beliefs, and whether these trajectories were associated with mental and behavioral health outcomes in early adulthood.Using data from a longitudinal preventive intervention study, we modeled trajectories of control-related beliefs using growth mixture modeling from 9th through 12th grade. The violence exposure of interest was witnessing severe community violence, defined as seeing someone being shot, stabbed, or killed. Early adulthood outcomes examined were post high school suicide attempt; having a criminal justice record; and having a diagnosis of substance use disorder, major depressive disorder, or antisocial personality disorder.The latent growth mixture model identified three trajectories of control-related beliefs: a low stable trajectory, a high increasing trajectory, and a moderate stable trajectory. Participants who were exposed to severe violent events were significantly more likely to be in the low trajectory. Further, those in the low trajectory were significantly more likely to experience several negative outcomes.Results suggest that witnessing severe forms of community violence impacts control-related belief trajectories and that trajectories characterized by low feelings of control are associated with adverse outcomes in early adulthood.",0.653509196

This study aimed to map the course and overlapping trajectories of mental health symptoms, and associations with PI in a traffic injury population. Methods In total, 2019 adults sustaining minor-to-moderate traffic injury were recruited within 28 days post-injury and assessed using phone interviews at 1, 6 and 12-months post-injury. Trajectories of DM, PTS and PI were established and relationships between DM, PTS and PI trajectories were explored using dual trajectory modelling. Bio-psychosocial predictors (e.g. pre-injury health, catastrophizing, acute distress, quality of life, social support) of mental health trajectories were investigated. Results Up to five typical post-trauma trajectories were identified for DM, PTS and PI. Most people were in a resilient mental health trajectory (over 60%, DM or PTS), or in a chronic PI trajectory (almost 60%) 12 months post-injury. While recovery/resilient mental health trajectories were strongly interrelated (73.4% joint probability and &gt; 94% conditional probabilities), DM/PTS comorbidity in chronic trajectories was not straightforward, suggesting a possibly asymmetric relationship. That is, persistent DM was more likely associated with persistent PTS (90.4%), than vice versa (31.9%), with a 22.5% probability that persistent PTS was associated with none or milder depression (i.e. following a recovery/resilient DM trajectory). An asymmetrical relationship was also found between mental health and PI. The majority of those with persistent PI were likely to be in a recovery/resilient DM/PTS trajectory (almost 70%), but those in a non-resilient DM/PTS trajectory showed a high risk of persistent PI. Predictors of non-resilient mental health trajectories included poorer pre-injury health and social support, and shared factors like acute psychological distress and pain catastrophizing. Conclusions Strong interrelations were confirmed between mental health symptoms and PI following traffic injury. However, persistent DM was more strongly linked to persistent PTS, than vice versa. Persistent PI was only linked with persistent DM/PTS in vulnerable subgroups. Early psychiatric/psychological interventions should target elevated psychological distress and negative appraisals in vulnerable individuals, to reduce long-term mental health morbidity/comorbidity and PI.

One hundred and fifty-nine table tennis players in intensive training centers completed a self-reported athlete burnout measure across 3 time points within a 2-month period characterized by high demands. Data were analyzed through latent class growth analysis. Results of latent class growth analysis showed 3 distinct trajectories for each athlete burnout dimension, indicating not only linear or quadratic change but also stability in longitudinal athlete burnout perceptions. Results also suggested that the 3 dimensions of athlete burnout did not develop in tandem. Rather, the likelihood of belonging to particular emerging trajectories of sport devaluation and physical/emotional exhaustion was significantly influenced by the athletes' perception of reduced accomplishment assessed at Time 1. Thus, reduced accomplishment predicted downstream changes in the 2 other athlete burnout dimensions. As a whole, these results highlighted that the multinomial heterogeneity in longitudinal athlete burnout symptoms needs to be accounted for in future research.",0.653194503

We examined trajectories of depression and anxiety over two pandemic years among children with and without MH disorders. Parents and children 2-18 years completed surveys at seven timepoints (April 2020 to June 2022). Parents completed validated measures of depression and anxiety for children 8-18 years, and validated measures of emotional/behavioural symptoms for children 2-7 years old; children ≥10 years completed validated measures of depression and anxiety. Latent growth curve analysis determined depression and anxiety trajectories, accounting for demographics, child and parent MH. Data were available on 1315 unique children (1259 parent-reports; 550 child-reports). Trajectories were stable across the study period, however individual variation in trajectories was statistically significant. Of included covariates, only initial symptom level predicted symptom trajectories. Among participants with pre-COVID data, a significant increase in depression symptoms relative to pre-pandemic levels was observed. Children and adolescents experienced elevated and sustained levels of depression and anxiety during the two-year period. Findings have direct policy implications in the prioritization and of maintenance of educational, recreational, and social activities with added MH supports in the face of future events.",0.653077069

A sample of 286 employees during 4 weeks of data was used (N occasions = 1,144). Results of latent class growth modeling showed that 3 trajectories could be identified: a nonbullying trajectory, which comprised 90.9% of the sample; an inverted U trajectory; and a delayed increase bullying trajectory; the latter two each had 4.2% of the participants. We found a significant interaction between time and trajectories when predicting insomnia and anxiety/depression, with each strain showing a differential pattern with each trajectory. It seems that the negative effects on insomnia are long-lasting and remain after bullying has already decreased. In the case of anxiety and depression, when bullying decreases strain indicators also decrease. In this study, by examining trajectories of bullying at work over time and their associations with strain, we provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of workplace bullying.

In the current study, the authors evaluated changes in symptom burden over the course of 12 months using pediatric Patient‐Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. Methods Data from 202 survivors aged 8 to 21 years and 262 parents of survivors who were aged 5 to 21 years were analyzed. All completed a PROMIS Cognition short form and computerized adaptive tests of pediatric Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity Function, and Peer Relationships. Approximately one‐half of participants (223 participants: 97 survivors of childhood brain tumors and 126 parents) completed the 12‐month follow‐up. Linear mixed‐effects models evaluated group‐level symptoms over time. Cox proportional hazard models explored whether symptoms predicted survival, and latent class growth analysis investigated patterns of individual‐level symptom changes over time. Results Linear mixed‐effects models demonstrated that patient‐reported Cognition and parent‐reported Anxiety worsened over time. Latent class growth analysis results indicated that patient and parent reports diverged, both with regard to the number of classes identified and in the trends of these classes. Parents and patients reported similar patterns of depression over time. For the other areas, parents either were more likely to observe different patterns (Peer Relationships and Mobility) or less likely to observe different patterns (Upper Extremity Function, Cognition, Anxiety, and Fatigue). Baseline patient‐reported Mobility and Upper Extremity Function were found to be associated with survival. Conclusions Survivors of childhood brain tumors demonstrated different trajectory patterns of symptom burden. Along with baseline functioning status and days since treatment, patient‐reported Mobility and Upper Extremity Function were associated with survival, suggesting a possible role for patient‐reported outcomes in clinical care, especially individualized, tailored assessments such as PROMIS.",0.652890317

The current study investigated how PTG may be attributed to experiences of a multitude of highly stressful life events, and how PTG is correlated with PTSD symptoms, the severity of the event, and the total number of childhood traumas experienced.Adolescents (N = 139) participated in a survey that assessed six major life events of childhood trauma and rated the severity of each event, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and PTG.The majority of adolescents attributed their PTG experiences to one event, despite experiencing multiple traumas. However, experiencing more events was associated with greater PTSS and some forms of PTG such as changed priorities, increased self-reliance, and establishing a new path in life. Results from regression analyses also showed that trauma severity and PTSS were linearly correlated with PTG, and thus, a curvilinear relationship was not identified.Cumulative traumatic events may lead to increases in a sense of personal growth, while also increasing distress, in nonclinical adolescents.

The latent classes and transition analyses identified three transitional patterns of depressive symptom trajectories, including a deteriorating pattern (8.2%), a recovering pattern (22.5%), and a consistently low pattern (69.3%). Additionally, the results showed that contextual risk factors (i.e., negative economic events, negative romantic relationships, and low college enrolment rates) in the transition period to young adulthood were more positively associated with deteriorated or recovered transition patterns of depressive symptom trajectories than with the consistently low transition patterns even after taking into account the effects of adolescent risk factors. The identification of dynamic transition patterns in depressive symptom trajectories from adolescence to young adulthood and risk factors provide useful tools for preventive and intervention efforts. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Heterogeneous trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence and young adulthood have been reported. Psychosocial characteristics differentiate trajectories of depressive symptoms from adolescence to young adulthood. What does this study add? Dynamic transition patterns of depressive symptom trajectories are found between adolescence and young adulthood. Life experiences in the transition period are uniquely associated with the transition patterns of depressive symptom trajectories even after adjusting the effects of adolescent characteristics.",0.652284677

Evidence that STBs can emerge in the preschool years suggests that some pathways leading to clinically significant STBs begin early in life.This prospective longitudinal study examined the developmental trajectories of STBs in children from ages 3 to 17, oversampled for preschool-onset depression.Three unique trajectories of STBs across childhood and adolescence were identified: low class (n = 273) characterized by low rates of STBs, early-persistent class (n = 21) characterized by steadily increasing STBs, and late-onset class (n = 21) characterized by low rates of STBs through age 10 followed by a dramatic increase from ages 11 to 14 years. Preschool measures of depression symptoms, externalizing symptoms, impulsivity, and lower income relative to needs were associated with both high-risk STB classes. Both high-risk STB classes reported greater functional impairment, more externalizing symptoms, and more cumulative stressful life events in adolescence relative to the low class; the late-onset class also reported poorer academic functioning relative to both the early-persistent and low classes.A significant minority of this prospectively followed group of preschool children evidenced STBs by and/or after age 10. Although relatively rare before age 10, approximately half of the children who experienced STBs in adolescence first exhibited STBs in early childhood and comprised a trajectory suggesting increasing STBs. In contrast, approximately half of children first exhibited STBs in early adolescence. Early screening and identification of at-risk youth during both preschool and late childhood is important for early intervention regarding STBs.",0.652241898

Little is known, however, regarding the longitudinal processes of co-occurring depression and PTSD among mothers with childhood adversity. The present study addressed this research gap by examining co-occurring postpartum depression and PTSD trajectories among mothers with childhood trauma history.177 mothers with childhood trauma history reported depression and PTSD symptoms at 4, 6, 12, 15 and 18 months postpartum, as well as individual (shame, posttraumatic cognitions, dissociation) and contextual (social support, childhood and postpartum trauma experiences) factors.Growth mixture modeling (GMM) identified three comorbid change patterns: The Resilient group (64%) showed the lowest levels of depression and PTSD that remained stable over time; the Vulnerable group (23%) displayed moderately high levels of comorbid depression and PTSD; and the Chronic High-Risk group (14%) showed the highest level of comorbid depression and PTSD. Further, a path model revealed that postpartum dissociation, negative posttraumatic cognitions, shame, as well as social support, and childhood and postpartum trauma experiences differentiated membership in the Chronic High-Risk and Vulnerable. Finally, we found that children of mothers in the Vulnerable group were reported as having more externalizing and total problem behaviors.Generalizability is limited, given this is a sample of mothers with childhood trauma history and demographic risk.The results highlight the strong comorbidity of postpartum depression and PTSD among mothers with childhood trauma history, and also emphasize its aversive impact on the offspring.",0.652193198

INTRODUCTION: MOVING THROUGH ADOLESCENCE: DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN AMERICAN YOUTH,"In this monograph, we investigate the developmental trajectories of a predominantly middle-class, community-based sample of European American and African American adolescents growing up in urban, suburban, and rural areas in Maryland, United States. Within risk-protection and positive youth development frameworks, we selected developmental measures based on the normative tasks of adolescence and the most widely studied indicators in the three major contexts of development: families, peer groups, and schools. Using hierarchical linear growth models, we estimated adolescents' growth trajectories from ages 12 to 20 with variation accounted for by socioeconomic status (SES), gender, race/ethnicity, and the gender by race/ethnicity interaction. In general, the results indicate that: (a) periods of greatest risk and positive development depended on the time frame and outcome being examined and (b) on average, these adolescents demonstrated much stronger evidence of positive than problematic development, even at their most vulnerable times. Absolute levels of their engagement in healthy behaviors, supportive relationships with parents and friends, and positive self-perceptions and psychological well-being were much higher than their reported angry and depressive feelings, engagement in risky behaviors, and negative relationships with parents and peers. We did not find evidence to support the idea that adolescence is a time of heightened risk. Rather, on average, these adolescents experienced relatively stable and developmentally healthy trajectories for a wide range of characteristics, behaviors, and relationships, with slight increases or decreases at different points in development that varied according to domain. Developmental trajectories differed minimally by SES but in some expected ways by gender and race/ethnicity, although these latter differences were not very marked. Overall, most of the young people navigated through their adolescence and arrived at young adulthood with good mental and physical health, positive relationships with their parents and peers, and high aspirations and expectations for what their future lives might hold.",0.651903225

Research also suggests that impaired self-control (in particular, heightened present bias) could be linked to delayed-onset post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among survivors of natural disasters. We examined a hypothesis that the association between disaster experiences and delayed-onset PTSS is mediated through present bias among older survivors of the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami. Methods The baseline survey was conducted for older adults who lived in a city located 80 km west of the epicentre 7 months before the disaster. Approximately 2.5 and 8.5 years after the disaster, we surveyed older survivors to assess the trajectory of PTSS (2230 participants). We implemented analyses by three analytical groups: (1) resilient versus delayed-onset, (2) resilient versus improved and (3) resilient versus persistent. Results Logistic regression models showed that major housing damage was linked to raised present bias in all analytical groups (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.04 to 5.87; OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.20 to 6.29; OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.15 to 6.10, respectively). The present bias, however, was significantly associated with only delayed-onset PTSS (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.69). In the group of resilient versus delayed onset, housing destruction was also associated with delayed-onset PTSS (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.37), and the association was attenuated by present bias (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.07 to 5.18).

Methods Caregivers of stroke survivors completed a survey of depressive symptoms, caregiving burden, family function, perceived availability of social support, and perceived health status at postdischarge and 1 year. Patterns of depressive symptom trajectory (ie, symptom-free, symptom relieved, symptom developed, and persistent symptom groups) were identified by grouping depressive symptoms based on 2 assessments using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the associations. Results Of the 102 caregivers, 57.8% were symptom-free, 20.6% experienced persistent depressive symptoms, 11.8% relieved depressive symptoms, and 9.8% developed depressive symptoms. There were significant changes in family function (Wilks λ = 0.914, P = .038) and perceived health status (Wilks λ = 0.914, P = .033) among the groups during the first year of caregiving. The persistent symptom group reported the highest level of burden and the lowest level of family function and perceived availability of social support at both assessment times. Compared with symptom-free caregivers, caregivers with persistent depressive symptoms were 7 times more likely to have fair/poor health rather than excellent/very good health at 1 year (odds ratio, 7.149; P = .012). Conclusion Caregivers with persistent depressive symptoms are the most vulnerable to negative psychosocial outcomes and poor perceived health status during the first year of caregiving from discharge for stroke survivors.",0.651479582

We included 937 persons with recent-onset psychosis enrolled at 19 programs across New York State. Demographic, social and clinical data was collected at program entry and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. We used growth mixture models to identify occupational and social functioning trajectories and examined the association between trajectory class, baseline factors and symptoms during 1-year follow-up. Four distinct trajectory classes of occupational and social functioning were identified. The converging (58.0%) class had disparate levels of functioning at baseline (low occupational, higher social) which eventually converged. The other classes had high-stable (14.8%), moderate-stable (17.8%) and low-improving (9.4%) trajectories. Female gender, educational attainment and private insurance status were significantly associated with the trajectory characterized by higher functioning, while living alone, homelessness, a longer period from psychosis onset to program enrollment, a schizophrenia diagnosis and cannabis use at enrollment were associated with the poorest trajectory.

Hip fractures may negatively influence trajectories of depressive symptoms in older adults. This study aimed to determine trajectories of depressive symptoms among older adults in England, overall and for those after hip fracture, and identify characteristics defining trajectory membership. Methods Analysis of adults aged 60 years or more (n=7,050), including a hip fracture subgroup (n = 384), from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Latent class growth mixture modelling was completed. Depressive symptom prevalence was estimated at baseline. Chi-squared tests were completed to compare baseline characteristics across trajectories. Results Three trajectory groups were identified overall and for those with hip fracture: no-, mild-, and moderate-severe- symptoms. The moderate-severe group comprised 13.7% and 7% of participants for overall and hip fracture populations respectively. Overall, the proportion of participants with depressive symptoms were 0.4%, 12.4% and 65.4% for no-, mild-, and moderate-severe- symptom groups, respectively. For the hip fracture subgroup, these proportions were 0.7%, 28.8%, and 85.2%. Depressive symptoms were stable over time, with a weak trend towards increasing severity for the moderate-severe group. Individuals with moderate-severe trajectories were older, more likely to be female, live alone and had worse health outcomes (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions Older adults, and those after hip fracture, follow one of three trajectories of depressive symptoms which are broadly stable over time. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was lower for those with hip fracture however, when present, the symptoms were more severe than the overall population. Results suggest a role of factors including age, gender, and marital status in depressive symptoms trajectories.",0.651294456

Adjustment disorder symptoms were measured at baseline and 12-month follow-up with the Brief Adjustment Disorder New Module based on the definition of adjustment disorder provided in the 11th Edition of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) released in 2018 by the World Health Organization (WHO).A latent transition analysis of adjustment symptoms identified four distinct trajectories: ""high symptom,"" ""recovery,"" ""onset,"" and ""low symptom."" We found 46% of ICD-11 adjustment disorder at baseline, and 29% of the sample was classified as having a high-symptom adjustment symptom profile. The high-symptom profile was predicted by ongoing stressors, female gender, and higher education.Study findings indicate that adjustment disorder among high-risk samples, in particular, those exposed to ongoing stressors, could have a high-symptom course over 12 months.",0.65123419

This study aimed to evaluate the joint developmental trajectories of maternal and paternal psychological distress and child internalizing and externalizing problems from early childhood to middle adolescence. Given that suicide and self-harm are major public health issues in adolescence and often occur in the context of other mental health issues, we also characterized the association between these joint trajectories and these outcomes in adolescence. Parallel-process latent class growth analysis was applied to 14 years of follow-up data from a large-scale, nationally representative sample of youths participating in the UK’s Millennium Cohort Study (MCS; n=12520, 50.9% male). Results showed the best-fitting solution had four trajectory classes: (1) low symptoms, 59.0%; (2) moderate symptoms in children, 22.5%; (3) notable symptoms in fathers, 10.7%; and (4) co-occurring maternal and child symptoms, 7.8%. Children’s sex differences were also observed in the joint trajectory groups. The trajectory groups differed in their self-harm and suicide attempts in adolescence, underscoring the importance of the roles of both parental distress and child problem behaviors processes in these outcomes. Our findings suggest the need for two-generation mental health intervention programs that are tailored based on co-developmental trajectory group membership and sexes.",0.650916881

This study used secondary data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and used four points in time to estimate trajectories of mental health during adulthood. This study included 834 participants who were born in 1959. The Latent Growth Curve Model (LGCM) was used for modeling and estimating the trajectories of mental health. The trajectories of mental health show non-linear change even after considering longitudinal changes of variables. The trajectories indicate a V-shaped curve: higher depression at 34 and 50 years of age and the lowest depression at 40 years. Males predicted lower intercepts of depression and those with higher self-esteem showed lower depression initially. This study provides further evidence for understanding baby boomers’ mental health during their adulthood within a longitudinal setting by using a nationwide sample. More specialized interventions and services should be considered for females’ mental health problems over time. It is also important to help individuals develop and cultivate their self-esteem before entering into middle age.,0.650875664
https://openalex.org/W2895900461,,Resiliency and quality of life trajectories after injury,"BACKGROUND Injury can greatly impact patients' long-term quality of life. Resilience refers to an individual's ability to positively adapt after facing stress or trauma. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between preinjury resiliency scores and quality of life after injury. METHODS Two hundred twenty-five adults admitted with an Injury Severity Score greater than 10 but without neurologic injury were included. The 36-item Short Form was administered at the time of admission and repeated at 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, and 12 months after injury. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was completed at admission and scores were categorized into high resiliency or not high resiliency. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify distinct recovery trajectories for physical component scores (PCS) and mental component scores (MCS) of the 36-item Short Form. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine whether baseline resiliency scores were predictive of PCS and MCS recovery trajectories. RESULTS Age, race, sex, mechanism of injury, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Injury Severity Score, presence of hypotension on admission, and insurance status were not associated with high resiliency. Compared with those who made less than US $10,000 per year, those who made more than US $50,000 per year had higher odds of being in the high resilience group (odds ratio, 10.92; 95% confidence interval, 2.58-46.32). Three PCS and 5 MCS trajectories were identified. There was no relationship between resilience and PCS trajectory. However, patients with high resiliency scores were 85% less likely to belong to trajectory 1, the trajectory that had the lowest mental health scores over the course of the study. Follow-up for the study was 93.8% for month 1, 82.7% for month 2, 69.4% for month 4, and 63.6% for month 12. CONCLUSION Patient resiliency predicts quality of life after injury in regards to mental health with over 25% of patients suffering poor mental health outcome trajectories. Efforts to teach resiliency skills to injured patients could improve long-term mental health for injured patients. Trauma centers are well positioned to carry out such interventions.

The analyses are based on five-wave panel data from “Natori City Life Recovery Population Panel Survey” ( n = 316), which was conducted in Natori City, Miyagi Prefecture from the fourth to the tenth years after the GEJE. Cluster analysis was performed to classify the life recovery trajectories and identified six distinct patterns. Two types of them remained at a low level of life recovery throughout the five-wave survey. Multiple correspondence analysis was conducted to analyze the relationships among life recovery trajectory patterns, pre-existing inequalities, and post-event social environmental changes. As a result, the survivors in these two types were typically older people, small household members, poor people, and persons with disabilities. These findings indicate that people with vulnerabilities who would experienced daily life troubles before the GEJE were also struggling even after the disaster.",0.650552928

Data were analyzed from 2,307 trauma-exposed veterans who completed at least one follow-up assessment over a 7-year period, a subsample of n = 3,157 veterans who participated in the first wave of the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study. Latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) was used to identify PTSD symptom courses over four survey waves conducted in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018. Sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial variables were examined as potential correlates of symptomatic trajectories. PTSD symptoms were best characterized by three courses: No/Low (89.2%), Moderate Symptom (7.6%), and High Symptom (3.2%). Relative to the No/Low Symptom course, symptomatic courses were positively associated with a greater number of lifetime traumatic events, higher scores on measures of physical health difficulties and lifetime psychiatric history (relative risk ratio [RRR] range = 1.19–2.74), and were negatively associated with time since index trauma, household income, and social connectedness (RRR range = 0.14–0.97). Veterans in the Moderate Symptom course additionally had lower scores on a measure of protective psychosocial characteristics (RRR = 0.78) and were more likely to have received mental health treatment (RRR = 1.62), while those in the High PTSD Symptom course were more likely to be exposed to combat and to more traumas since Wave 1 (RRR range = 1.23–4.63). Three PTSD symptom courses in U.S. veterans were identified, with more than 10% of veterans exhibiting a moderate or high symptom course. Prevention and treatment efforts targeting modifiable correlates, such as social connectedness, may help mitigate symptomatic PTSD symptom courses in this population.",0.650543255

Most people recover in six months, but some experience persistent pain and disability for one year or longer after injury. Therefore, it is important to understand the factors that can help predict poor recovery.To identify recovery trajectories in DRF patients and to determine the factors that can help predict poor recovery.Recovery was assessed in 318 patients using the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation scale at baseline, three, six, and 12 months. Demographic information was collected in addition to the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire, from which data regarding depression were extracted. Latent growth curve analysis (LGCA) was used to identify the recovery trajectories. Comparisons of proportion between the emergent classes were then conducted using chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests.The LGCA revealed three distinct trajectories (rapid-recovery: (69%), slow-recovery: (23%), and non-recovery: (8%) as the best fit to the data. The proportion of people with depression was significantly greater in the non-recovery class (24%) compared to the slow (16%, p = 0.04) and rapid-recovery (8%, p = 0.03) classes. Additionally, the proportion of females were significantly lower in the non-recovery (64%, p = 0.03) compared to the slow (85%, p = 0.03) and the rapid-recovery classes (81%, p = 0.048).Recovery from DRF was best described using three different trajectories. Greater self-reported depression and a lower proportion of females in the non-recovery class were distinguishing factors between the classes.

Participants included 331 youth, ages 10 to 14 at the first wave of the study, assessed annually over 5 years. A latent growth curve approach was used to test three research questions, including whether perceived stress would increase across adolescence, whether distress tolerance (as measured by a behavioral task) would predict changes in perceived stress, and whether changes in perceived stress would mediate the relation between distress tolerance and internalizing symptoms. Results suggest that, consistent with previous findings, rates of perceived stress do increase across adolescence. Further, findings indicate that distress intolerance at baseline predicted increases in perceived stress, which in turn drove increases in internalizing symptoms. These findings point to the critical role of distress tolerance in bringing about changes in depression and anxiety symptoms and suggest support for utilizing a negative reinforcement framework to understand the emergence of internalizing symptomology.",0.650384739

Responders' symptom-change trajectories during response to acute-phase CT may predict longer term outcomes.We studied adult outpatients (N = 220) with recurrent MDD who responded to CT but had residual symptoms. Responders with linear (steady improvement), log-linear (quicker improvement earlier and slower later), one-step (a single, relatively large, stable improvement between adjacent assessments), or undefined (not linear, log-linear, or one-step) symptom trajectories were assessed every 4 months for 32 additional months.Defined (linear, log-linear, one-step) versus undefined acute-phase trajectories predicted lower depressive symptoms (d = 0.36), lower weekly probability of being in a major depressive episode (OR = 0.46), higher weekly probabilities of remission (OR = 1.93) and recovery (OR = 2.35), less hopelessness (d = 0.41), fewer dysfunctional attitudes (d = 0.31), and better social adjustment (d = 0.32) for 32 months after acute-phase CT. Differences among defined trajectory groups were nonsignificant.Responding to acute-phase CT with a defined trajectory (orderly pattern) of symptom reduction predicts better longer term outcomes, but which defined trajectory (linear, log-linear, or one-step) appears unimportant. Frequent measurement of depressive symptoms to identify un/defined CT response trajectories may clarify need for continued clinical monitoring and treatment.",0.650261315

A gas explosion instantly killed five firefighters, one police officer and 18 other people. Moreover, 132 people were wounded among which many suffered severe burn injuries.In the framework of a large health survey of people potentially involved in the disaster, data were collected from 3,448 households, of which 7,148 persons aged 15 years and older, at 5 months (T1) and at 14 months (T2) after the explosion. Hierarchical regression was used to determine the significant predictors and to assess their proportion in variance accounted for.The degree of exposure to the disaster was a predictor of the severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Peritraumatic dissociation appeared to be the most important predictor of the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms at T1. But at T2, posttraumatic stress symptoms at T1 had become the most important predictor. Dissatisfaction with social support was positively linked to development of posttraumatic stress symptoms at T1 and to the maintenance of these symptoms at T2. Survivors who received psychological help reported significant benefits.In harmony with the findings from studies on technological disasters, at T1 6,0% of the respondents showed sufficient symptoms to meet all criteria for a full PTSD. At T2, 6,6% still suffered from posttraumatic stress symptoms. The symptoms of the different victim categories clearly indicated the influence of the degree of exposure on the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Problems inherent to retrospective scientific research after a disaster are discussed.",0.650231829

A latent class growth modeling analysis,"Depression increased sharply during the initial months of COVID-19, but how it developed over time is rarely explored, especially for adolescents. The current study measured depression of 605 final year high school students in China over 11 months in 4 waves. The latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) was used to examine overall trends in depression and latent class growth modeling (LCGM) was used to identify potential subgroups of adolescents' depressive trajectories. At the same time, gender, life events, and rumination were included as time-invariant covariates. Overall, the development of depression in the final year of high school students showed a slight downward trend. Meanwhile, the depression trajectories showed heterogeneity, and three categories of depression trajectories were identified, which were low-stable (24.3%), depression-risk (67.9%), and high-stable (7.8%). Neuroticism, rumination, and life events such as punishment and loss were found to significantly predict these trajectories of depression. This study helps to characterize differential depression trajectories among adolescents throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and establish several related predictors of the trajectory of depression.",0.649497833

No previous study has examined the development of grief symptoms in trajectories over time. We aimed to investigate trajectories of grief symptoms in bereaved partners and non-partners of severely ill patients starting before death until three years after death of the patient.We conducted a prospective population-based cohort study including 1138 partners and 597 non-partners of terminally ill patients. Participants completed the Prolonged Grief-13 scale pre-loss, six months post-loss, and three years post-loss. On this basis, we developed semi-parametric group-based trajectory models. Multinomial logistic regression models estimated, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between selected characteristics: age, gender, educational level, the patient's survival time, and types of grief trajectories.We identified five specific grief trajectories for partners and four for non-partners. Low grief was identified in 34% of partners and 45% of non-partners, moderate/decreasing grief in 30% of partners and 31% of non-partners, high/decreasing grief in 20% of partners and 16% of non-partners, and high grief in 7% of partners and 8% of non-partners. In addition, a late grief trajectory was identified in 10% of partners. Low education compared to high education was associated with adverse grief trajectories (OR = 0.19 (95% CI = 0.80, 0.43) for partners following a high grief trajectory).This study is the first to systematically describe specific trajectories of grief based on grief symptoms. The majority had a low or decreasing grief trajectory, whereas minor groups of partners and non-partners had a high grief trajectory, and a group of partners had a late grief trajectory. A consistent vulnerability factor was low education. Bereaved individuals may benefit from information on possible patterns of grief development, including adverse grief trajectories.",0.649138889

However, the genetic factors that influence risk for early-onset depression remain mostly unknown. Using data collected over 13 years, we examined whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) that capture genetic risk for depression were associated with depressive symptom trajectories assessed from childhood to adolescence.Data came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective, longitudinal birth cohort (analytic sample = 7,308 youth). We analyzed the relationship between genetic susceptibility to depression and three time-dependent measures of depressive symptoms trajectories spanning 4-16.5 years of age (class, onset, and cumulative burden). Trajectories were constructed using a growth mixture model with structured residuals. PRS were generated from the summary statistics of a genome-wide association study of depression risk using data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, UK Biobank, and 23andMe, Inc. We used MAGMA to identify gene-level associations with these measures.Youth were classified into six classes of depressive symptom trajectories: high/renitent (27.9% of youth), high/reversing (9.1%), childhood decrease (7.3%), late childhood peak (3.3%), adolescent spike (2.5%), and minimal symptoms (49.9%). PRS discriminated between youth in the late childhood peak, high/reversing, and high/renitent classes compared to the minimal symptoms and childhood decrease classes.

Participants completed measures of grief severity, cognitive factors (loss-related memory characteristics, negative appraisals, unhelpful coping strategies, and grief resilience), as well as measures of interpersonal individual differences (attachment and dependency). Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify classes of grief trajectories. Predictors of class membership were identified using multinomial logistic regression and multigroup structural equation modeling.Four latent classes were identified: 3 high grief classes (Stable, Low Adaptation, and High Adaptation) and a low grief class (Low Grief). When considered separately, variance in all four cognitive factors predicted membership of the high grief classes. When considered together, membership of the high grief classes was predicted by higher mean scores on memory characteristics. More negative appraisals predicted low or no adaptation from high grief severity. Losing a child also predicted membership to the stable class. Fast adaptation of high grief was predicted by a pattern of high memory characteristics but low engagement with unhelpful coping strategies.The findings have implications for clinical practice and point to early cognitive predictors of adaptation patterns in grief. Findings are consistent with cognitive models highlighting the importance of characteristics of memory, negative appraisals, and unhelpful coping strategies in the adaptation to highly negative life events.

This is vital because it facilitates early awareness of burnout trends and related psychological maladjustments, which might influence mental health problems, thus promoting proactive prevention and intervention before deterioration. We utilized four-wave longitudinal data from 415 adolescents who completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey and Symptom Check List-47. Data were analysed using growth mixture modeling. The results indicated that developmental trajectories of academic burnout can be characterized by three linear trajectories, ‘moderate-maintain’ ( N = 213, 51.33%) which is related to depression, ‘low-deteriorated’ ( N = 15, 3.61%) which is related to compulsion, and ‘well-adjusted’ ( N = 158, 38.07%) which is related to no maladjustment symptoms.

However, few prospective studies in high-risk samples delineate distinct trajectories of internalizing symptoms from preschool age onward. We examined trajectories in a high-risk cohort, oversampled for internalizing symptoms, several preschool risk/maintenance factors, and school-age outcomes. Parents of 325 children completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire on up to four waves of data collection from preschool (3-5 years) to school age (8-9 years) and Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment interviews at both ages. Multi-informant data were collected on risk factors and symptoms. Growth mixture modelling identified four trajectory classes of internalizing symptoms with stable low, rising low-to-moderate, stable moderate, and stable high symptoms.

The current study tested whether declines in risk scores occurred uniformly for all individuals in a community corrections sample or whether distinct groups could be identified on the basis of similar trajectories of change in acute risk and time to recidivism. We additionally tested whether accounting for group heterogeneity improved prospective prediction of recidivism. Methods This study used longitudinal, multiple-reassessment data gathered from 3,421 individuals supervised on parole in New Zealand ( N = 92,104 assessments of theoretically dynamic risk factors conducted by community corrections supervision officers). We applied joint latent class modelling (JLCM) to model group trajectories of change in acute risk following re-entry while accounting for data missing due to recidivism (i.e., missing not at random). We compared accuracy of dynamic predictions based on the selected joint latent class model to an equivalent joint model with no latent class structure. Results We identified four trajectory groups of acute dynamic risk. Groups were consistently estimated across a split sample. Trajectories differed in direction and degree of change but using the latent class structure did not improve discrimination when predicting recidivism. Conclusions There may be significant heterogeneity in how individuals’ assessed level of acute risk changes following re-entry, but determining risk for recidivism should not be based on probable group membership. JLCM revealed heterogeneity in early re-entry unlikely to be observed using traditional analytic approaches.",0.647374211

In this trajectory, the improvement occurred in the first half of the measurements, with a plateau thereafter. A second trajectory was characterized by higher initial severity and an improvement, mainly in the second part of the measurements. For the Beck Depression Inventory, one trajectory was marked by lower initial distress. In this group, the improvement occurred throughout the entire period. The remaining patients were characterized by higher initial distress and a decreased level of distress in the last part of treatment. They began to improve only during the third year of therapy.

Using latent profile analysis, we determined the optimal number of PTSD symptom change classes over time and analyzed whether baseline and follow-up variables were associated with class membership. Results Five classes, namely rapid responder (7–17%), steep linear responder (14–22%), gradual responder (30–34%), non-responder (27–33%), and symptom exacerbation (7–13%) classes, characterized each treatment. No baseline clinical characteristics predicted class membership for S-PE and M-PE; in PCT, more negative baseline trauma cognitions predicted membership in the non-responder v. gradual responder class. Class membership was robustly associated with PTSD, trauma cognitions, and depression up to 6 months after treatment for both S-PE and M-PE but not for PCT. Conclusions Distinct profiles of treatment response emerged that were similar across interventions. By and large, no baseline variables predicted responder class. Responder status was a strong predictor of future symptom severity for PE, whereas response to PCT was not as strongly associated with future symptoms.",0.647217846

These classes show associations with baseline variables, which could be used at the start of treatment to indicate a patient’s likely trajectory. This has not been explored in patients receiving internet-enabled therapy or for trajectories of functional impairment scores. Method: Patients experiencing common mental health problems received cognitive-behavioural therapy with a therapist using an online chat platform (N=52,029). Trajectory classes of depression symptoms (PHQ9), anxiety symptoms (GAD7) and functional impairment (WSAS) were investigated using growth mixture modelling. Associations between baseline variables and trajectory class were tested with multinomial regressions. Results: A four-class trajectory model was selected for each outcome and these were highly similar in form. Each showed three classes with initially moderate-severe symptoms or impairment: one demonstrated no change, one gradual improvement and one fast improvement. A fourth class had mild baseline scores and minimal improvement. In the moderate-severe baseline classes, patients in the two with improvement were more likely employed and not to have obsessive-compulsive disorder. Fast improvement was likelier than gradual or no change for older patients, patients without a disability, or with lower comorbid symptom or impairment scores. Associations with the functional impairment model were more similar to the depression than anxiety model. Conclusion: Results were largely consistent with in-person psychological therapy findings. Additionally, trajectories of functional impairment, a somewhat overlooked outcome, were identified. This is an important step towards personalising therapy in terms of length and continuation.",0.6472149

Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the 1-year trajectories of postpartum depressive symptoms and their associated risk factors.A total of 22,493 pregnant women were recruited between July 2013 and September 2016 in the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project Birth and Three-Generation Cohort Study in Japan. Among them, 11,668 women with no missing data were included in the analyses. Depressive symptoms were assessed at 1 month and 1 year postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Multinominal logistic regression analysis was conducted after adjusting for covariates.The prevalence of depression was 13.9% at 1 month and 12.9% at 1 year postpartum. We identified four depression trajectories, i.e., ""persistent (depressed throughout the 1 year postpartum)"" (6.0%), ""recovered (depressed at 1 month postpartum and recovered within a year)"" (7.9%), ""late-onset (became depressed after 1 month postpartum)"" (6.8%), and ""resilient (not depressed throughout 1 year postpartum)"" (79.2%). Psychological distress during pregnancy was significantly associated with all trajectories (persistent: odds ratio [OR]=10.24, 95% confidence interval (CI)=8.40-12.48; recovered: OR=3.78, 95%CI=3.28-4.36; and late-onset: OR=3.96, 95%CI=3.40-4.62).Postpartum depression was evaluated only by a self-administered questionnaire and the dropout rate was not neglectable.This study highlighted the high prevalence of depressive symptoms at 1 year postpartum and found that half of the depressive symptoms at 1 year were late-onset. The findings suggest the necessity of long-term follow-up (up to 1 year) for perinatal mental health.",0.647001263

This chapter takes a person-centered approach to examine the dynamics of mother-child relationships from adolescence to adulthood, and the associations of these trajectories with adult child well-being. The authors present empirical findings from the two-generation Youth Development Study, where more than 1000 9th graders have been followed for over two decades. A growth mixture model latent trajectory analysis identified three pathways of G1 mother and G2 child relationship quality: persistently close relationships as youth moved from adolescence to adulthood, initially lower but increasing closeness over time, and diminishing closeness through the transition to adulthood. The chapter reports an examination of these trajectories in relation to G2 adult mental health, finding that the two trajectories indicating problematic mother-child relationships, either in adolescence or in adulthood, are associated with higher adult depressed mood and lower self-esteem.",0.646831555

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of family cohesion (family functioning) on the trajectory of HSCT recipients' symptom distress (symptom frequency and symptom bother) before, during, and after HSCT.Secondary analysis was conducted using data collected from178 individuals who underwent HSCT. Longitudinal parallel process (LPP) modeling was used to examine how family cohesion and HSCT-associated symptoms (symptom frequency and symptom bother) change over time, and how these longitudinal changes relate to each other.The trajectory of family cohesion predicted the trajectories of HSCT-associated symptom frequency and bother. HSCT recipients who experienced higher family cohesion at baseline (T1) showed lower symptom frequency (p < .01) as well as symptom bother (p < .01) at T1. This trajectory analysis also showed that HSCT recipients who had improved family cohesion over time reported decrease in symptom frequency (p < .01) as well as bother (p < .01) over time.Findings indicate that higher family cohesion predicts decrease in symptom distress over the HSCT trajectory. Interventions aimed at enhancing family cohesion have the potential to lower HSCT recipients' symptom distress. Further research is needed to understand the critical role of family cohesion and family functioning and their relationship with HSCT symptom distress prevention, early detection, and risk stratification.",0.646232965

The goal of this study was to identify and explore meaningful classes of youth based on their pre- and post-intervention depression symptoms scores with 722 youth involved in a 15-week healthy relationships and mental health promotion program. We utilized latent class growth analysis to identify depression class trajectories, controlling for group clustering effects. A three-class solution identified high decreasing, moderate stable, and low stable trajectories. Gender, age, and reported experience of bullying victimization predicted trajectory class membership. The low stable class trajectory was associated with the highest positive mental health, followed by the moderate stable and the high decreasing trajectories. These results suggest that youth with the highest depression scores showed significant improvement in symptomatology over the course of the program.",0.646109812

Latent class linear mixed effects modeling of the ratio of FEV1 to FVC was used to identify distinct lung function trajectories among participants with two or more spirometry measurements between ages 11 and 32 years.Among 599 participants with 2,142 observations, a model with two distinct trajectories (a low trajectory [n = 56; 9.3%] and a normal trajectory) fit the data significantly better than a model with only one trajectory (P = 0.0007). As compared with those with a normal trajectory, participants with a persistently low trajectory were more likely to have a history of maternal asthma (20.0% vs. 9.9%; P = 0.02); early life lower respiratory illness caused by respiratory syncytial virus (41.2% vs. 21.4%; P = 0.001); and physician-diagnosed active asthma at age 32 years (43.9% vs. 16.2%; P < 0.001). Individuals with a persistently low trajectory also demonstrated lower lung function as measured by average maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity during infancy and at age 6 years.A distinct group of individuals in a nonselected population demonstrates a persistently low lung function trajectory that may be partly established at birth and predisposes them to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease later in life.",0.645939611

Health outcomes for self-care, physical and nutritional status, mental health, and depression were assessed at 3-month intervals up to 24-months after hospital discharge. Trajectories of social support were derived with latent class analysis while hierarchical linear models were employed to assess the associations of social-support trajectory with health outcomes.Four social-support trajectories were derived for persons with DM following hip-fracture surgery: poor and declining (n = 18, 11.4%), moderate and stable (n = 29, 18.4%), high but declining (n = 34, 21.5%), and high and stable (n = 77, 48.7%). Relative to those in the poor and declining group, participants in the high and stable trajectory group performed better in Activities of Daily Living and quadriceps muscle power, had better mental Health-Related Quality of Life and nutritional status, and had fewer depressive symptoms. These differences persisted over the 2 years following hospital discharge.These results suggest social support for persons with DM should be continually assessed following hip-fracture surgery.",0.645902716

The primary presenting problem children report after disasters is posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Prior research suggests that PTSS is inversely related to social support, which is often disrupted after a disaster.Objective: This study examined the relationship between social support (from parents, teachers, and peers) and PTSS in children affected by Hurricane Katrina. The research contributes to the literature by examining the mechanisms that drive this relationship over time.Methods: In this study, 426 children were followed over four timepoints, beginning 3–7 months after Hurricane Katrina and concluding 25–27 months post-hurricane. Three path models analysed the relationship between social support (from parents, teachers, and peers, measured by the Social Support Scale for Children) and PTSS (measured by the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index). Covariates included child age, minority status, gender, perceived life threat, and actual life threat. Nonsignificant paths were trimmed from the final models. Global fit indices were examined to determine model fit.Results: In the parent and peer social support models, PTSS exhibited statistically significant effects on social support from one wave to the next. In the teacher model, this was only true between Waves 2 and 3. Social support showed a statistically significant effect on PTSS between Wave 2 and Wave 3 in the peer model (standardized estimate = −0.26, p < .0001). No paths from social support to PTSS were significant in the parent and teacher models.Conclusion: Findings support a social selection model in which PTSS undermine social support, particularly in the first two years post-disaster. If these findings are replicated, this suggests that, in cases of limited funding, PTSS should be prioritized, given their cascading effects on social support.",0.645886261

In particular, it describes change patterns within each latent sub-population and investigates between-individual differences in within-individual change for each sub-group. A key research interest in using GMMs is examining how covariates influence the heterogeneity in change patterns. Liu & Perera (2022b) extended mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which primarily focus on time-invariant covariates, to allow covariates to account for both within-group and between-group differences and investigate the heterogeneity in nonlinear trajectories. The present study further extends Liu & Perera, 2022b by examining the effects of time-varying covariates (TVCs) on trajectory heterogeneity. Specifically, we propose methods to decompose a TVC into an initial trait (the baseline value of the TVC) and a set of temporal states (interval-specific slopes or changes of the TVC). The initial trait is allowed to account for within-group differences in growth factors of trajectories (i.e., baseline effect), while the temporal states are allowed to impact observed values of a longitudinal process (i.e., temporal effects). We evaluate the proposed models using a simulation study and real-world data analysis. The simulation study demonstrates that the proposed models are capable of separating trajectories into several clusters and generally producing unbiased and accurate estimates with target coverage probabilities. The proposed models reveal the heterogeneity in initial trait and temporal states of reading ability across latent classes of students' mathematics performance. Additionally, the baseline and temporal effects on mathematics development of reading ability are also heterogeneous across the clusters of students.",0.645440732

Here, we aimed to identify trajectory-based biomarkers using blood transcriptomes collected in the immediate aftermath of trauma exposure. Participants were recruited from an Emergency Department in the immediate aftermath of trauma exposure and assessed for PTSD symptoms at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Three empirical symptom trajectories (chronic-PTSD, remitting, and resilient) were identified in 377 individuals based on longitudinal symptoms across four data points (1, 3, 6, and 12 months), using latent growth mixture modeling. Blood transcriptomes were examined for association with longitudinal symptom trajectories, followed by expression quantitative trait locus analysis. GRIN3B and AMOTL1 blood mRNA levels were associated with chronic vs. resilient post-trauma symptom trajectories at a transcriptome-wide significant level (N = 153, FDR-corrected p value = 0.0063 and 0.0253, respectively). We identified four genetic variants that regulate mRNA blood expression levels of GRIN3B. Among these, GRIN3B rs10401454 was associated with PTSD in an independent dataset (N = 3521, p = 0.04). Examination of the BrainCloud and GTEx databases revealed that rs10401454 was associated with brain mRNA expression levels of GRIN3B. While further replication and validation studies are needed, our data suggest that GRIN3B, a glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit-3B, may be involved in the manifestation of PTSD. In addition, the blood mRNA level of GRIN3B may be a promising early biomarker for the PTSD manifestation and development.",0.645388778

Symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity were modeled simultaneously in a longitudinal latent class analyses, using parent reports collected in Grades 3, 6, 9, and 12. Three developmental trajectories emerged: (1) low levels of inattention and hyperactivity (low), (2) initially high but then declining symptoms (declining), and (3) continuously high symptoms that featured hyperactivity in childhood and early adolescence and inattention in adolescence (high). Multinomial logistic regressions examined child characteristics and family risk factors as predictors of ADHD trajectories. Relative to the low class, children in the high and declining classes displayed similar elevations of inattention and hyperactivity in early childhood. The high class was distinguished from the declining class by higher rates of aggression and hyperactivity at school and emotion dysregulation at home. In contrast, the declining class displayed more social isolation at home and school, relative to the low class. Families of children in both high and declining trajectory classes experienced elevated life stressors, and parents of children in the high class were also more inconsistent in their discipline practices relative to the low class. By late adolescence, children in the high class were significantly more antisocial than those in the low class, with higher rates of arrests, school dropout, and unemployment, whereas children in the declining class did not differ from those in the low trajectory class. The developmental and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",0.64518654

Research Design and Methods We used 10 years of data collection (2000/01-2010/11) from the Canadian National Population Health Study (n = 7114). Episodes of depression symptoms were identified using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short-Form. We assessed the presence of local parks, healthy food stores, fast food restaurants, health services and cultural services using geospatial data. We used latent class growth modelling to identify different trajectories of depression symptom episodes in the sample and tested for the effect of neighbourhood variables on the trajectories over time. Results We uncovered three distinct trajectories of depression symptom episodes: low prevalence (76.2% of the sample), moderate prevalence (19.2%) and high prevalence of depression symptom episodes (2.8%). The presence of any neighbourhood service (healthy food store, fast-food restaurant, health service, except for cultural service) was significantly associated with a lower probability of a depression symptom episode for those following a trajectory of low prevalence of depression symptom episodes. The presence of a local park was also a significant protective factor in trajectory groups with both low and moderate prevalence of depression symptom episodes. Neighbourhood characteristics did not significantly affect the trajectory of high prevalence of depression symptom episodes. Conclusions For individuals following a trajectory of low and moderate prevalence of depression symptom episodes, the neighbourhood built environment was associated with a shift in the trajectory of depression symptom episodes. Future intervention studies are recommended to make policy recommendations.",0.645178776

However, few studies have investigated the role of early life risk factors in the development of these trajectories. The present study aimed to: (1) derive latent trajectories of affective symptoms over a period of more than 50 years (ages 13-69), and (2) examine early life risk factors for associations with specific life course trajectories of affective symptoms.Participants are from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) (n = 5,362). Affective symptoms were measured prospectively at ages 13, 15, 36, 43, 53, 60-64 and 69. A latent variable modelling framework was implemented to model longitudinal profiles of affective symptoms. Twenty-four prospectively measured early life predictors were tested for associations with different symptom profiles using multinomial logistic regression.Four life course profiles of affective symptoms were identified: (1) absence of symptoms (66.6% of the sample); (2) adolescent symptoms with good adult outcome (15.2%); (3) adult symptoms only (with no symptoms in adolescence and late life) (12.9%); (4) symptoms in adolescence and mid adulthood (5.2%). Of the 24 early life predictors observed, only four were associated with life course trajectories, with small effect sizes observed.People differ in their life course trajectories of anxiety and depression symptoms and that these differences are not largely influenced by early life factors tested in this study.",0.645175632
https://openalex.org/W3186718443,,Assessing Mediational Processes in Parallel Bilinear Spline Growth Curve Models in the Framework of Individual Measurement Occasions,"Multiple existing studies have developed multivariate growth models with nonlinear functional forms to explore joint development where two longitudinal records are associated over time. However, multiple repeated outcomes are not necessarily synchronous. Accordingly, it is of interest to investigate an association between two repeated variables on different occasions, for example, how a short-term change of one variable affects a long-term change of the other(s). One statistical tool for such analyses is longitudinal mediation models. In this study, we extend latent growth mediation models with linear trajectories (Cheong et al., 2003) and develop two models to evaluate mediational processes where the bilinear spline (i.e., the linear-linear piecewise) growth model is utilized to capture the change patterns. We define the mediational process as either the baseline covariate or the change of covariate influencing the change of the mediator, which, in turn, affects the change of the outcome. We present the proposed models by simulation studies. Our simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed mediational models can provide unbiased and accurate point estimates with target coverage probabilities with a 95% confidence interval. To illustrate modeling procedures, we analyze empirical longitudinal records of multiple disciplinary subjects, including reading, mathematics, and science test scores, from Grade K to Grade 5. The empirical analyses demonstrate that the proposed model can estimate covariates' direct and indirect effects on the change of the outcome. Through the real-world data analyses, we also provide a set of feasible recommendations for empirical researchers. We also provide the corresponding code for the proposed models.",0.645155225

This study aimed to identify the frailty trajectory, subgroups of the frailty trajectory, and the predictors that differentiate these subgroups among community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults.The participants were 9,775 individuals aged 45 years and older who participated in the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (2006-2018). Frailty was measured using a frailty instrument comprising three items: grip strength weakness, exhaustion, and social isolation. Latent growth curve modeling and latent class growth modeling were performed to identify the frailty trajectory and latent classes of the trajectory. Multinomial logistic regression was used to confirm the predictors that classified the latent classes.Over 12 years, the slope of the frailty trajectory among the participants showed a gradual increase. In addition, there was a difference in the latent class of frailty trajectories among middle-aged and older adults. The middle-aged participants were divided into two groups: maintaining robustness and changing from pre-frailty to robustness. The older adults were divided into three groups: maintaining robustness, maintaining pre-frailty, and changing from the frailty to pre-frailty group. Regular exercise, cognitive dysfunction, and social participation were significant predictors that differentiated each latent class in both middle-aged and older adults; additionally, current smoking and the number of chronic diseases were significant predictors in middle-aged people.Various subgroups within the frailty trajectory existed among community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults.

This study aimed to (a) determine the probable recovery trajectories in physical and mental HRQoL; (b) examine the impact of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on HRQoL scores within these trajectory groups; and (c) examine the influence of predictor covariates on trajectory group membership. 336 (63% female, Mage =44.72; SD =14.77) injured RTC survivors completed the SF-36v2 at approximately 6, 12, and 24 months after sustaining a RTC injury. Participants also completed telephone interviews to assess prior history of psychological disorder and current PTSD at each wave. Three trajectories were identified for SF-36v2 Physical Component Score (PCS): ”gradual recovery” (27.3%);”low but improving” (54.7%); and”severe and chronic” (17.9%). Four trajectories were defined for SF36v2 Mental Component Score (MCS): “unaffected” (19.1%);”severe but improving” (24.1%);”severe and declining” (17.3%); and”low but improving” (39.5%). A PTSD diagnosis significantly reduced SF36v2 component scores only in trajectories associated with poorer outcome. Age was predictive of trajectory group membership for PCS, whereas injury severity was predictive of trajectory group membership for MCS. Use of a compensation seeking sample affects generalizability to the general RTC population. This study identified a concerning subgroup of individuals who have chronic and/or declining physical and mental HRQoL that can be impacted by a diagnosis of PTSD. The development of interventions with a special focus on associated psychological injury is needed to improve the HRQoL of at-risk individuals following RTC injury.",0.644867747

One-third of couples served as a comparison group by participating in data collection after their deployments were canceled. We proposed that 1) service members and partners would display multiple trajectories of depression symptoms that differ as a function of role (i.e., service member or at-home partner) and exposure to deployment; 2) trajectory patterns would be associated with indicators of human capital; 3) service members’ and partners’ depression symptoms would be linked to each other. We found that depressive symptom trajectories varied by exposure to deployment and role, and that higher levels of human capital were mostly associated with lower depressive symptoms, although we did not find support for partner interdependence.

Methods: Trajectories of LTPA were established using group-based trajectory analysis with a latent class growth model in a population-based cohort between 1996 and 2014. A Cox-proportional hazard model was conducted to examine the associations of LTPA quintiles and LTPA trajectories with all-cause mortality. Results: A total of 21,211 participants (age 18-90 years) were analyzed (median follow-up 16.8 years). The study participants were divided into five groups according to percentiles of LTPA (<20th, 20th-<40th, 40th-<60th, 60th-<80th, ≥80th) and LTPA trajectories (low/stable, medium/stable, increasing, decreasing, and fluctuating), respectively. Participants with a decreasing trajectory did not have a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality despite having the highest baseline level of LTPA. In contrast, participants with a medium/stable (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.98, p = 0.031) or an increasing (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.97, p = 0.037) trajectory had a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality.

To remedy unmet mental health needs, active outreach was used to identify victims at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.Objective: The active outreach strategy was evaluated by examining the accuracy of screening methods in predicting PTSD and depression, self-reported treatment needs, and the extent to which perceived treatment needs predict trajectories of PTSD.Method: In 112 adult survivors, semi-structured telephone interviews were held at 2 (T1, n = 76), 9 (T2, n = 77) and 44 months (T3, n = 55) after the crash. The Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) measured symptoms of PTSD and depression, respectively. At T3, a clinical interview assessed PTSD and depression diagnoses. Based on the TSQ scores at the three time-points, participants were grouped into five ‘trajectories’: resilient (n = 38), chronic (n = 30), recovery (n = 9), delayed onset (n = 9) and relapse (n = 3).Results: The TSQ accurately predicted PTSD at T3 (sensitivity: .75–1.00; specificity: .79–.90). The PHQ-2 showed modest accuracy (sensitivity: .38–.89; specificity: .67–.90). Both measures provided low positive predictive values (TSQ: 0.57; PHQ-2: .50 at T3). A number of participants reported unmet treatment needs (T1: 32.9%; T2: 19.5%; T3: 10.9%). Reporting unmet needs at T2 was more often assigned to a chronic PTSD trajectory compared to reporting no needs (p < .01).Conclusions: The prevalence of unmet needs at 44 months after the crash within a chronic PTSD trajectory indicated that active outreach may be warranted. Nevertheless, although the TSQ was accurate, many participants screening positive did not develop PTSD. This implies that, although active outreach may benefit those with unmet needs, it also has its costs in terms of possible unnecessary clinical assessments.",0.644293408

Using group-based trajectory modelling, we assessed (a) demographic (age, gender, education, cancer site) predictors of trajectory membership, (b) shift in trajectories associated with planned and unplanned hospitalizations, emergency room visits and chemotherapy, and (c) the association between trajectory membership and place of death.We identified three trajectories of physical symptoms-""persistent mild"" (56%), ""progressive moderate"" (36%), and ""progressive severe"" (8%), and two for psychological distress-""persistent mild"" (72%) and ""progressive distress"" (28%). Females (β = 1.40 [SE = 0.55], p-value = 0.01) and highly educated patients (β = 1.46 [SE = 0.62], p-value = 0.02) were more likely to experience progressive severe symptoms compared to persistent mild symptoms. Older patients were less likely (β = -1.01 [SE = 0.33], p-value = 0.003), while those with gynecological cancers (β = 1.51 [SE = 0.65], p-value = 0.02) were more likely to experience progressive distress compared to persistent mild distress. Planned and unplanned hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and chemotherapy were associated with a worsening in trajectories. Patients with higher distress were more likely to die in a hospice compared to a hospital.Interventions to improve physical symptoms and distress can focus on patients at risk of being in worse trajectories and at critical time points in the last year of life-hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and chemotherapy.",0.64416686

Identifying risk for post-treatment worsening of symptoms using latent trajectories of change in eating disorder (ED) symptoms during treatment could allow for personalization of treatment to improve long-term outcomes METHODS: Participants (N = 56) with BN-spectrum EDs received 16 sessions of CBT and completed digital self-monitoring of eating episodes and ED behaviors. The Eating Disorder Examination was used to measured ED symptoms at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Latent growth mixture modeling of digital self-monitoring data identified latent growth classes. Kruskal-Wallis H tests examined effect of trajectory of change in ED symptoms on post-treatment to follow-up symptom change.Multi-class models of change in binge eating, compensatory behaviors, and regular eating improved fit over one-class models. Individuals with high frequency-rapid response in binge eating (H(1) = 10.68, p =0 .001, η2 = 0.24) had greater recurrence of compensatory behaviors compared to individuals with low frequency-static response. Individuals with static change in regular eating exhibited greater recurrence of binge eating than individuals with moderate response (H(1) = 8.99, p = 0.003, η2 = 0.20).Trajectories of change in ED symptoms predict post-treatment worsening of symptoms. Personalized treatment approaches should be evaluated among individuals at risk of poor long-term outcomes.IV, evidence obtained from multiple time series.ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT03673540, registration date: September 17, 2018.",0.64410111

Life satisfaction is a main factor in the general construct of subjective well-being. However, there is limited literature available on the interrelationship between emotional outcomes and life satisfaction post–severe TBI over time. The purpose of this study was to characterize distinct patterns of change in depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction over 24 months after severe TBI and evaluate the interrelationship of different trajectory groups among them as well as associated subject characteristics. Methods: This prospective study used longitudinal data collected from the University of Pittsburgh Brain Trauma Research Center from survivors of severe TBI ( N = 129). In addition to demographic and injury-related data, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction were collected at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postinjury. A group-based trajectory model was performed to identify distinct longitudinal patterns of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction. The interrelationships of distinct trajectory groups were examined using χ 2 tests. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine the predictors of different emotional symptom trajectories. Results: The group-based trajectory model identified 2 distinct patterns of each of 3 outcomes: constantly low and constantly high depressive symptoms group (70.4% vs 29.6%), constantly low and constantly high anxiety group (69.1% vs 30.9%), and low-decreasing and high-stable life satisfaction groups (56.3% vs 43.7%). A strong pairwise association was observed between trajectory group membership for depressive symptoms and anxiety ( P &lt; .0001), depressive symptoms and life satisfaction ( P &lt; .0001), and anxiety and life satisfaction ( P &lt; .001). Subjects with increased severe injury were more likely to belong to the high-stable depressive symptoms group, while there were no significant associations between age, gender, race, education, marriage status and distinct depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction trajectory groups. Conclusions: A group-based trajectory model revealed patterns of emotional symptoms that have not been fully explored among survivors of severe TBI. There appear to be distinct trajectory patterns for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and life satisfaction, respectively. There was strong interrelationship among emotional symptoms. The findings add to our understanding of psychosocial outcomes experienced over time after severe TBI.",0.644059957

Some people recover within months and others report symptoms for extended periods. Recent research identified distinct recovery pathways. Identifying recovery pathways for people with this condition in compensable settings could assist clinical and claim management.This study aimed to identify recovery trajectories based on disability, pain catastrophising and mental health and, secondly, to examine developmental linkages between the trajectories.A cohort of 246 people with compensable WAD were followed for 24 months after a motor vehicle related injury.Functional Rating Index (FRI), Pain Catastrophising Scale (PCS) and the SF36 Mental Component Score (SF 36 MCS).Group-based trajectory analytical techniques were used to identify distinct post-injury profiles. Multinominal logistic regression modelling identified factors associated with membership of different trajectories.246 people were enrolled a median of 72 days after injury. Three trajectories were identified for the measures used and their prevalences, respectively, were: for disability (FRI) they were mild (47%), moderate (31%), and severe (22%); for pain catastrophising (PCS) they were non-catastrophisers (55%), moderate-low catastrophisers (32%) and clinically significant catastrophisers (13%); and, for mental health (SF36 MCS) they were good mental health (40%), moderately low mental health (42%) and severely low mental health (18%). All groups showed no further recovery beyond 12 months after injury. The significant baseline predictors of the severe disability trajectory were: lower (that means worse) bodily pain scores (SF 36 BPS) (p≤0.01); high pain catastrophising (p≤0.01); and, self-reported fair or poor general health (p=0.03). Conditional probabilities for group membership showed that the three trajectories for both PCS and FRI were linked. Dual membership was high for the mild disability and mild pain catastrophising trajectories and, for the severe disability and clinically significant pain catastrophising trajectories.There is a strong and plausible association between severe disability, clinical levels of pain catastrophising and low mental health. Claimants can be identified at claim notification based on three estimated recovery trajectories. Claim and clinical interventions can be targeted to the profile within each recovery trajectory.",0.644030248

The aim of the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study was to identify trajectories of anxiety, depression and COVID-19-related traumatic stress (CV19TS) symptomology during the first UK national lockdown. We also sought to explore risk and protective factors. The study was a longitudinal, three-wave survey of UK adults conducted online. Analysis used growth mixture modelling and logistic regressions. Data was collected from 1958 adults. A robust 4-class model for anxiety, depression, and CV19TS symptomology distinguished participants in relation to the severity and stability of symptomology. Classes described low and stable and high and stable symptomology, and symptomology that improved or declined across the study period. Several risk and protection factors were identified as predicting membership of classes (e.g., mental health factors, sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 worries). This study reports trajectories describing a differential impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of UK adults. Some adults experienced psychological distress throughout, some were more vulnerable in the early weeks, and for others vulnerability was delayed. These findings emphasise the need for appropriate mental health support interventions to promote improved outcomes in the COVID-19 recovery phase and future pandemics.",0.64384543

Resilience refers to an individual’s ability to positively adapt after facing stress or trauma. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between preinjury resiliency scores and quality of life after injury. METHODS Two hundred twenty-five adults admitted with an Injury Severity Score greater than 10 but without neurologic injury were included. The 36-item Short Form was administered at the time of admission and repeated at 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, and 12 months after injury. The Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale was completed at admission and scores were categorized into high resiliency or not high resiliency. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify distinct recovery trajectories for physical component scores (PCS) and mental component scores (MCS) of the 36-item Short Form. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine whether baseline resiliency scores were predictive of PCS and MCS recovery trajectories. RESULTS Age, race, sex, mechanism of injury, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Injury Severity Score, presence of hypotension on admission, and insurance status were not associated with high resiliency. Compared with those who made less than US $10,000 per year, those who made more than US $50,000 per year had higher odds of being in the high resilience group (odds ratio, 10.92; 95% confidence interval, 2.58–46.32). Three PCS and 5 MCS trajectories were identified. There was no relationship between resilience and PCS trajectory. However, patients with high resiliency scores were 85% less likely to belong to trajectory 1, the trajectory that had the lowest mental health scores over the course of the study. Follow-up for the study was 93.8% for month 1, 82.7% for month 2, 69.4% for month 4, and 63.6% for month 12. CONCLUSION Patient resiliency predicts quality of life after injury in regards to mental health with over 25% of patients suffering poor mental health outcome trajectories. Efforts to teach resiliency skills to injured patients could improve long-term mental health for injured patients. Trauma centers are well positioned to carry out such interventions.

Aging and environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the speed of telomere attrition. Current evidence suggests a link between relative telomere length (RTL) and depression but the directionality of the relationship remains unclear. We prospectively examined associations between RTL and subsequent depressive symptom trajectories.Among 8,801 women of the Nurses' Health Study, depressive symptoms were measured every 4 years from 1992 to 2012; group-based trajectories of symptoms were identified using latent class growth-curve analysis. Multinomial logistic models were used to relate midlife RTLs to the probabilities of assignment to subsequent depressive symptom trajectory groups.We identified four depressive symptom trajectory groups: minimal depressive symptoms (62%), worsening depressive symptoms (14%), improving depressive symptoms (19%), and persistent-severe depressive symptoms (5%). Longer midlife RTLs were related to significantly lower odds of being in the worsening symptoms trajectory versus minimal trajectory but not to other trajectories. In comparison with being in the minimal symptoms group, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of being in the worsening depressive symptoms group was 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.97; p = 0.02), for every standard deviation increase in baseline RTL.In this large prospective study of generally healthy women, longer telomeres at midlife were associated with significantly lower risk of a subsequent trajectory of worsening mood symptoms over 20 years. The results raise the possibility of telomere shortening as a novel contributing factor to late-life depression.",0.643372799

By studying the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and response to Hurricane Sandy our findings demonstrate that adverse childhood experiences can alter the way traumatic events in adulthood are experienced. This finding in turn, has important implications for clinical practice, as it identifies a group of people likely to be at risk for adult trauma.",0.642634782

Associations were evaluated between trajectory assignment and individual attributes. Analyses were repeated for 2591 patients with early disease.In the general patient population, six trajectories were discerned, ranging from very minimal to very high impairment at baseline, with variability in impairment accrual. The clusters with moderate to very high walking impairment were associated with being female, older and Black American, longer symptom duration, progressive course, and depressive symptoms. In the early disease subset, eight trajectories were discerned that included two subgroups that rapidly accrued impairment.We identified novel subgroups of MS patients will distinct long-term T25-FW trajectories.

We hypothesized that high perceived parental criticism would be associated with more severe depression over 18-months of follow-up. The study involved secondary analyses from the Youth Partners in Care trial, which demonstrated that a quality improvement intervention aimed at increasing access to evidence-based depression treatment in primary care led to improved depression outcomes at post-treatment compared to usual care enhanced by provider education regarding depression evaluation/management. Patients (N = 418; ages 13–21) were assessed at four time points: baseline; post-treatment (six-month follow-up); 12- and 18-month follow-ups. The primary analysis estimated the effect of perceived parental criticism on likelihood of severe depression (i.e., Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale ≥ 24) over post-intervention follow-ups using a repeated-measures logistic regression model. Secondarily, a linear mixed-effects growth model examined symptom trajectories from baseline through 18-months using the Mental Health Index-5, a measure of emotional distress available at all time-points. High perceived parental criticism emerged as a robust predictor of clinically-elevated depression (OR=1.66, p=.02) and a more pernicious symptom trajectory over 18-months (β =-1.89, p<.0001). The association between the self-report perceived criticism and traditional expressed emotion measures derived from verbal and nonverbal parental behaviors was not evaluated. Results support perceived parental criticism as a predictor of youth depression outcomes over 18-months. This brief measure can be feasibly integrated within clinical assessment to assist clinicians in optimizing treatment benefits.",0.642248985

Hypothesis/Problem The researchers were interested in the effects of pre-employment disaster exposure on firefighter recruits' depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms during the first three years of fire service and hypothesized that: (1) disaster-exposed firefighters would have greater depression and PTSD symptoms than non-exposed overall; and (2) depression and PTSD symptoms would worsen over years in fire service in exposed firefighters, but not in their unexposed counterparts.In a baseline interview, 35 male firefighter recruits from seven US cities reported lifetime exposure to natural disaster. These disaster-exposed male firefighter recruits were matched on age, city, and education with non-exposed recruits.A generalized linear mixed model revealed a significant exposure×time interaction (e coef =1.04; P<.001), such that depression symptoms increased with time for those with pre-employment disaster exposure only. This pattern persisted after controlling for social support from colleagues (e coefficient=1.05; P<.001), social support from families (e coefficient=1.04; P=.001), and on-the-job trauma exposure (coefficient=0.06; e coefficient=1.11; P<.001). Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms did not vary significantly between exposure groups at baseline (P=.61).Depression symptoms increased with time for those with pre-employment disaster exposure only, even after controlling for social support.

However, there are few studies on the long-term trajectories of depressive symptoms in the Chinese middle-aged and elderly disabled population. This study aimed to identify the different development trajectories of depressive symptoms and their influencing factors in middle-aged and elderly people with disabilities in China. Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018, a longitudinal cohort was formed for the study. A total of 2053 participants underwent at least two measures of depressive symptoms, assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D10), a depression symptom assessment scale. We constructed a Group-Based Trajectory Model (GBTM) to identify the development trajectory of depressive symptoms in 2053 middle-aged and elderly disabled individuals, screened the potential predictors using lasso regression, and analyzed the factors affecting the development trajectory of depression through multivariate logistic regression. We identified four depression symptom trajectories throughout the follow-up process: “low depressive symptom group”, “worsening depressive symptom group”, “relieved depressive symptom group”, and “high depressive symptom group”. We found that there were differences in basic characteristics among different subgroups of depression trajectory. However, middle-aged and elderly disabled women living in rural areas, with limited ADL or IADL, physical pain, poor self-reported health and self-reported memory, short sleep time, and no relatives and friends to take care of them were the key groups for the prevention and treatment of depressive symptoms. There is heterogeneity in the trajectories of depressive symptoms in the Chinese middle-aged and elderly disabled population, it is necessary to focus on the characteristics of the trajectories of different subgroups.",0.641817163

Objective: The aim of this study was to identify classes of bereaved individuals with similar trajectories of PGD symptoms and to identify symptoms predicting the classes with a problematic grief trajectory. Method: Using data from 166 Dutch bereaved individuals, we conducted a latent class analysis to identify classes of bereaved individuals with similar trajectories of PGD symptoms between two time points (six and 18 months, respectively). Next, we used Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to examine which early symptoms best predicted membership of a class with a problematic grief trajectory. Results: We found two classes with a problematic grief trajectory in adults over the first two years after a loss. Daily endorsement of yearning, feeling stunned, anger and/or feeling that life is empty could act as early indicators of these two classes. Conclusions: This first study about early indicators of problematic grief trajectories among adults will help caregivers to identify bereaved individuals at risk for developing psychopathology.",0.641352494

Accordingly, we examined the co-development of bullying perpetration and narcissistic personality traits across adolescence and examined the childhood predictors of these joint trajectories. Method: Self-reports of bullying and narcissistic personality traits were assessed across six years of adolescence from Grade 7 (i.e., age 13) to Grade 12 (i.e., age 18) in a sample of 616 Canadian adolescents and childhood predictors were assessed in Grades 5 and 6. Results: As predicted, latent class growth analyses demonstrated that most adolescents were reflected in a trajectory of low decreasing bullying (82.0%) and a smaller group followed a moderate stable trajectory of bullying (18.0%). The majority of adolescents followed a moderate stable trajectory of narcissistic traits (56.3%), followed by a high increasing trajectory of narcissistic traits (22.8%), and a low decreasing trajectory of narcissistic traits (20.9%). Six percent of adolescents followed a high-risk dual trajectory of moderate stable bullying and high increasing narcissistic traits (high-risk group). Also as predicted, higher hyperactivity, higher frustration, and lower anxiety in childhood differentiated the high-risk group from a low-risk group (low decreasing bullying and low decreasing narcissistic traits; 19.0%). Higher childhood hyperactivity also differentiated a group of adolescents who followed a trajectory of moderate stable bullying and moderate stable narcissistic traits (10.0%) from the low-risk group. Results showed that moderate stable bullying was a better indicator of high increasing and moderate stable trajectories of narcissistic personality traits than the reverse. Conclusions: Findings suggest adolescence is a time when personality and bullying reflect dynamic and heterogeneous development. Early intervention of childhood risk factors may help prevent a high-risk developmental course of bullying and narcissistic personality traits across adolescence.",0.641223123

Therefore, this study aimed to explore different trajectories of depressive symptoms in NKDs and identify predictors of the worsening of depressive symptoms. In particular, the focus was on whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) functions as a significant predictor.Participants consisted of 300 NKDs who settled in South Korea within 3 years of entering in the country. Five waves of longitudinal data collected from 2016 to 2019 were used. In this study, the North Korean Composite International Diagnostic Interview (NK-CIDI), a diagnostic interview tool, was conducted at baseline and depressive symptoms were measured at each wave. Trajectory identification was based on latent class mixed modeling. Logistic regression was used to extract the significant factors predicting a high/increasing depressive symptom trajectory.Two trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified: ""low/stable symptom"" (76.7% of participants) and ""high/increasing symptom"" (23.3% of participants). Predictors of the high/increasing symptom group were being female and a low use of mental health services. Generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and alcohol dependence acted as significant predictors. Although PTSD was not a significant predictor, self-reported PTSD symptom scores were high in the high/increasing symptom group.Identifying the trajectories of depressive symptoms in NKDs helps identify the risk factors of clinically vulnerable groups. In the process of establishing government-level interventions, it may be helpful to create a therapeutic environment. In addition, when evaluating initial psychiatric problems, it is important to primarily consider NKDs' anxiety levels and alcohol problems. There should also be an appropriate consideration of PTSD symptoms.",0.641197924

The National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (N = 8981) is used to classify children into 5 categories based on their family’s pattern of SA use from age 4–5 to 10–11: always or never on SA, a single transition on or off SA, or fluctuations on and off SA. Latent growth modelling is used to compare trajectories of emotional and behavioural problems among children with different patterns of SA exposure to their counterparts never on SA over this same time period. Child emotional and behavioural problems are exacerbated over time in accordance with patterns of SA use: chronic SA use (behavioural) and moving onto SA (emotional and behavioural). These differential rates of change result in mental health disparities at age 10–11 that were not present at age 4–5. Children exposed to SA when they were age 4–5 but subsequently moved off continue to demonstrate elevated levels of emotional and behavioural problems at age 10–11. Successful social policies and interventions will require understanding the specific mechanisms through which SA undermines child mental health and how programs can be modified to reduce its negative consequences.",0.64081264

The survey was administered to a spatially stratified, random sample of households in the three coastal counties of Mississippi. A total of 216 participants were included in this study who lived in close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico coastline during both disasters. Results from structural equation modeling analyses indicated that there was a significant and inverse relationship between PTG and loneliness. Conversely, a direct relationship was not found between PTG and depressive symptoms; instead, the results revealed an indirect relationship between PTG and depressive symptoms through loneliness. Social capital was related to loneliness only indirectly through PTG, while psychological resilience was related to loneliness both directly and indirectly through PTG. Understanding the relationships among these factors, particularly the importance of PTG, can provide insight into the long-term adaptation among those who have survived multiple disasters. Further, these findings may lead to nuanced methods for behavioral health practitioners in assessing and treating individuals with symptoms of depression in disaster-prone communities.",0.640421979

This gap exists despite evidence of resilience highlighting alternative and healthy physical, social, and psychological futures for youth who were abused. This study tested whether trajectories of resilience identified in studies of psychological functioning were applicable to sexual health. Using data from the first four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, latent class growth analysis was conducted among individuals with histories of CM (N = 1,437). On average, participants were 15, 16, 21, and 28 years old, respectively, by waves of data collection. About half of the sample was female (55%), the majority were White (66%), and a sizeable portion had experienced multiple forms of CM prior to Wave I (38%). Controlling for CM severity, three distinct sexual health trajectory classes were identified: resilient, survival, and improving, which were differentiated by age and biological sex. Older participants’ sexual health was more likely to diminish over time, girls were more likely to show gains in sexual health over time, and significant differences in levels of sexual behaviors between the classes were only present during adolescence. Findings support the need for increased attention on the potential for sexual health despite experiences of CM, and highlight the applicability of resilience theory to youth sexuality.",0.640159518

The current study describes the longitudinal trajectory of marital, parent-child, and sibling conflict beginning around the time of diagnosis through the first year of treatment. We examined the average level of marital, parent-child, and sibling conflict at each monthly time point in the first year of treatment; the proportion of families that fall into the distressed range of marital, parent-child, and sibling conflict at each time point; the typical trajectory of conflict during the first year of treatment and whether there are differences in trajectories across families. Method A total of 160 families of children newly diagnosed with cancer (Mage = 5.6 years; range = 2-18 years) participated in a short-term prospective longitudinal study. Primary caregivers provided monthly reports of marital, parent-child, and sibling conflict. Results Using multilevel modeling (MLM), most families showed stability in quality of family relationships, although considerable between-family variability was observed. For married couples, 25-36% of couples were in the distressed range at one time point over the first year of treatment. For married couples, more distress occurred at earlier months, particularly month 3. For parent-child and sibling dyads, the most difficult time periods were during later months. Conclusion Implications for development of interventions that target at-risk family relationships are discussed. Identifying processes that predict between-family variability in trajectories of family relationships is an important next step, particularly for the marital relationship.

The model predicts the post-disaster population composition of a city, changes in its income distribution and citizen welfare, and changes in the level of public goods. Plausible ex-ante assumptions about urban characteristics lead to a post-disaster city that is smaller, more skill-intensive, and with higher mean educational attainment. The evolution of income inequality is more complex, even though unskilled wages rise, middle-class flight may cause income distribution to worsen. The analysis of disasters’ long term impact on fiscal structure and on demographic, income, and human capital distribution, illustrates the interplay of major determinants of resilience after a natural disaster. A stylized New Orleans around the time of its 2005 Katrina disaster is incorporated for realism and used as an example throughout. Predicted changes are broadly consistent with observed effects of Katrina on New Orleans.",0.639711818

However, the predictors and implications of distinct changing patterns of perceived stress during the transition to college life are less clear. To address these research gaps, the current study aims to identify distinct patterns of perceived stress trajectories among 582 Chinese first-year college students (Mage = 18.11, SDage = 0.65; 69.40% female) across the first 6 months upon enrollment. Three distinct profiles of perceived stress trajectories, i.e., low-stable (15.63%), middle-decreasing (69.07%), and high-decreasing (15.29%), were identified. Moreover, individuals who followed the low-stable trajectory showed better distal outcomes (specifically, higher levels of well-being and academic adjustment) 8 months after enrollment than those who followed the other two trajectories. Furthermore, two types of positive mindset (a growth mindset of intelligence and a stress-is-enhancing mindset) contributed to differences in perceived stress trajectory, either independently or jointly. These findings highlight the significance of identifying different patterns of perceived stress among students during the transition to college, as well as the protective roles of both a stress mindset and a mindset of intelligence.",0.639612354

Linear mixed-effects models evaluated the association between PTSD symptom trajectories and average pain and pain interference outcomes while adjusting for receipt of RA during combat casualty care.Four PTSD trajectories were characterized: resilient, recovering, worsening, and chronic. Differential pain presentations were associated with PTSD symptom trajectories, even after adjusting for receipt of RA. Compared to those with a resilient PTSD symptom trajectory, individuals presenting with chronic PTSD trajectories were estimated to experience average pain scores 2.61 points higher (95% CI: 1.71, 3.14). Participants presenting with worsening (β = 1.42; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.78) and recovering PTSD trajectories (β = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.09, 1.08) were estimated to experience higher average pain scores than participants with resilient PTSD trajectories. Significant differences in pain interference scores were observed across PTSD trajectories. Receiving RA was associated with improved pain up to two years after injury (β = -0.31; 95% CI: -0.90, -0.04), however no statistically significant association was detected between RA and PTSD trajectories.Chronic and worsening PTSD trajectories were associated with greater pain intensity and interference following combat injury even when accounting for receipt of early RA for pain management. These findings underscore the need to jointly assess pain and PTSD symptoms across the trauma care continuum.",0.639538785
https://openalex.org/W3087692398,10.1002/jts.22586,The Influence of Premigration Trauma Exposure and Early Postmigration Stressors on Changes in Mental Health Over Time Among Refugees in Australia,"Abstract As a result of the precarious conditions in which they migrate, refugees are likely to have experiences that increase their risk of mental health problems. Refugees tend to be predisposed to relatively high levels of distress upon resettlement, and a key predictor of these issues is traumatic experiences that occur before their arrival. Despite high initial levels of ill‐health, on average, refugees tend to experience mental health recovery over time. However, both levels of mental health upon settlement and recovery over time may be negatively influenced by stressors in the postsettlement period. The present study examined changes in psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms over 5 years among 2,169 refugees from various backgrounds, predominately from Iraq and Afghanistan, who participated in the Building a New Life in Australia (BNLA) study. A multivariate latent growth curve model found mental ill‐health decreased on average, β = −.21 for distress and β = −.31 for PTSD, p s &lt; .001, and premigration trauma exposure predicted more initial PTSD symptoms and reduced recovery over time, β Intercept = .21, β Slope = −.54, p &lt; .001. Postmigration stressors, such as loneliness, financial concerns, and cultural integration, predicted higher levels of mental health problems as well as reduced recovery over time. These findings suggest that beyond trauma exposure, the mental health of refugees upon resettlement and their recovery over time is impacted by stressors in the early resettlement period, which has important implications for interventions and services to support and encourage well‐being in refugee populations.",0.63953657

Increasing evidence suggests that interindividual differences in the severity of these outcomes result from differences in victimization experiences. However, longitudinal research largely overlooked victimization forms. Additionally, it is unclear how the quality of students' relationships with peers and teachers functions as a risk or protective factor for different patterns of victimization development. This one-year longitudinal study investigated joint trajectories of relational and physical victimization and examined differences between these trajectory classes regarding classroom social relationships as possible antecedents and social-emotional well-being as a possible outcome. A sample of 930 fourth to sixth graders (55 classes, 53.1% girls, Mage = 10.55, SD = 0.90) completed self-reports about relational and physical victimization and social-emotional outcomes (i.e., depressive symptoms, self-esteem). Peer nominations were used to measure the social antecedents (i.e., peer rejection and acceptance, teacher-student closeness and conflict). A 3-step approach including Latent Class Growth Analyses and Growth Mixture Modeling yielded two trajectory classes. Most students experienced low, decreasing relational and physical victimization. A smaller group experienced higher, generally stable victimization, more relational than physical. Younger students and girls were more likely to be members of the latter class. This class was more rejected, less accepted, reported more depressive symptoms and lower self-esteem. Teacher-student closeness and conflict were similar across classes. The current study showed that relational and physical victimization followed a largely parallel development. Low social status was found to be a risk factor for belonging to a victimization trajectory that is characterized by stable levels of both relational and physical victimization, with higher levels of the relational form.",0.638883007

However, the pandemic has demonstrated heterogeneous mental health effects, suggesting that individual-level factors could play a role in buffering or exacerbating its deleterious impact. This study aimed to understand how individual differences in resilience were associated with trajectories of obsessive-compulsive, depression, and anxiety symptoms among healthy adults and those with OCD residing in New York City, considered the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States at its onset. The sample consisted of healthy individuals (n = 30) and people with OCD (n = 33) who completed clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires that assessed baseline resilience, OCD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and perceived positive effects of the pandemic at four assessment timepoints: baseline (April 2020) and one, two, and six months later. Linear mixed-effects growth models revealed that greater resilience was associated with stable trajectories of symptoms over time. Conversely, less resilience was associated with worsening obsessive-compulsive symptoms from the two-month to six-month assessment timepoints and worsening depressive symptoms at six months across both groups, and with worsening anxiety symptoms in individuals with OCD at six months. Resilience was correlated with the ability to appreciate ""silver linings"" of the pandemic. These findings highlight resilience as a potential treatment target for bolstering mental health outcomes among individuals with and without psychopathology during sustained and unprecedented periods of stress.",0.638714655

Infant PA was observed in play and feeding tasks during lab visits at 3, 6, and 12 months of age; parenting behaviors were observed at 3 months. Mothers completed questionnaires regarding their symptoms of depression throughout the prenatal period and during the first 3 months postpartum. Growth curve analyses indicated that infant PA increased across time, and this finding replicated across both the play and feeding tasks, though increases slowed over time. Neither maternal prenatal nor postpartum depression symptoms predicted infants' PA trajectories, but mothers' PA, positive parenting, and disengaged parenting were associated with infant PA during the play task. Our finding that infant PA increased over the first year postpartum suggests PA trajectories among infants of mothers with a history of depression may be indices of resilience, despite risks associated with their mothers' history of depression. Furthermore, this study highlights parenting behaviors that may be important targets of prevention and early intervention efforts to bolster infant PA.",0.638566234

This study employs latent transition analysis of psychological trauma from intake into a juvenile justice diversion program until termination, followed by modeling of recidivism. A comparison model of a logistic regression without latent variables is also presented, to answer whether the same results would have been achieved without using latent variable modeling. Results indicate that juvenile justice–involved (JJI) youth are assigned into four psychological trauma classes at intake, and three at termination. Latent status membership predicts 6-month recidivism ( p = .03). Those who begin in classes that have Depression, Post-Traumatic Stress, and Anger have higher odds of recidivating than those who demonstrate generally high or low trauma symptoms at intake. The comparison regression model found no significant relationship between the five trauma symptom domains and recidivism. Implications for employing latent variable modeling and person-centered analyses for recidivism research are discussed.",0.63854141

We hypothesized that: 1) a substantial subset of families would demonstrate trajectories of persistent elevated caregiver distress and impaired family functioning 12 months after hospitalization and 2) sociodemographic and clinical risk factors would be associated with trajectories of persistent distress and family dysfunction.Prospective cohort.Fourteen PICUs in the United States.Caregivers of 260 children who survived community-acquired septic shock.None.Caregivers completed ratings of distress on the Brief Symptom Inventory and of family functioning on the Family Assessment Device at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after hospitalization. Results from group-based trajectory modeling indicated that 67% of the current sample was characterized by persistent low caregiver distress, 26% by persistent moderate to high distress that remained stable across 12 months (high-risk caregiver distress group), and 8% by initial high distress followed by gradual recovery. Forty percent of the sample was characterized by stable high family functioning, 15% by persistent high dysfunction across 12 months (high-risk family functioning group), 12% by gradually improving functioning, and 32% by deteriorating function over time. Independently of age, child race was associated with membership in the high-risk caregiver distress group (non-white/Hispanic; effect size, -0.12; p = 0.010). There were no significant sociodemographic or clinical correlates of the high-risk family functioning group in multivariable analyses.Although the majority of families whose children survived community-acquired septic shock were characterized by resilience, a subgroup demonstrated trajectories of persistently elevated distress and family dysfunction during the 12 months after hospitalization. Results suggest a need for family-based psychosocial screening after pediatric septic shock to identify and support at-risk families.",0.63835189

Research has been limited by an assumption that children with concussion are a homogenous group. OBJECTIVE To identify (i) distinctive postconcussive recovery trajectories in children and (ii) injury-related and psychosocial factors associated with these trajectories. METHODS This study is part of a larger prospective, longitudinal study. Parents of 169 children (5-18 yr) reported their child's PCS over 3 mo following concussion. PCS above baseline levels formed the primary outcome. Injury-related, demographic, and preinjury information, and child and parent mental health were assessed for association with trajectory groups. Data were analyzed using group-based trajectory modeling, multinomial logistic regression, and chi-squared tests. RESULTS We identified 5 postconcussive recovery trajectories from acute to 3 mo postinjury. (1) Low Acute Recovered (26.6%): consistently low PCS; (2) Slow to Recover (13.6%): elevated symptoms gradually reducing; (3) High Acute Recovered (29.6%): initially elevated symptoms reducing quickly to baseline; (4) Moderate Persistent (18.3%): consistent, moderate levels of PCS; (5) Severe Persistent (11.8%): persisting high PCS. Higher levels of child internalizing behaviors and greater parental distress were associated with membership to the Severe Persistent group, relative to the Low Acute Recovered group. CONCLUSION This study indicates variability in postconcussive recovery according to 5 differential trajectories, with groups distinguished by the number of reported symptoms, levels of child internalizing behavior problems, and parental psychological distress. Identification of differential recovery trajectories may allow for targeted early intervention for children at risk of poorer outcomes.",0.638250375

The present study seeks to provide insight into how CT subtypes may impact distinct depressive symptoms over time based on the dimensional model of adversity (DMA). A total of 3535 college freshmen participated in a 2-year, four waves longitudinal tracking study. A conditional parallel latent growth curve model (LGCM) was constructed to examine the impacts of different types of CT (threat and deprivation) on the development of depressed mood and anhedonia, and whether these relationships vary across gender. Our findings revealed that threat and deprivation could differentially relate to depressed mood and anhedonia. Both threat and deprivation predicted initial depressed mood levels (β = 0.309, p < 0.001; β = 0.175, p < 0.001, respectively) and its trajectory (β = −0.139, p = 0.068; β = −0.168, p < 0.05, respectively). Only deprivation predicted anhedonia levels (β = 0.318, p < 0.001) and trajectory (β = −0.218, p < 0.001). This pattern of relationships between CT and depressive symptoms varied across gender. These findings highlight specific pathways and symptomatic manifestations of the impacts of different CT subtypes on depression and are consistent with the hypothesis of DMA. Threat and deprivation predicted more severe depressed mood, whereas deprivation uniquely conferred to the risk of depression via elevated anhedonia. Meanwhile, the deleterious effects of CT would persist during early adulthood. Gender differences were also discussed.",0.638084544

Yet, the majority of exposed individuals are resilient, highlighting the importance of identifying underlying factors that contribute to outcomes. Methods The current study was part of a larger prospective study of children in Long Island, New York (n = 260). At age 9, children viewed unpleasant and pleasant images while the late positive potential (LPP), an event-related potential component that reflects sustained attention toward salient information, was measured. Following the event-related potential assessment, Hurricane Sandy, the second costliest hurricane in United States history, hit the region. Eight weeks after the hurricane, mothers reported on exposure to hurricane-related stress and children’s internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Symptoms were reassessed 8 months after the hurricane. Results The LPP predicted both internalizing and externalizing symptoms after accounting for prehurricane symptomatology and interacted with stress to predict externalizing symptoms. Among children exposed to higher levels of hurricane-related stress, enhanced neural reactivity to unpleasant images predicted greater externalizing symptoms 8 weeks after the disaster, while greater neural reactivity to pleasant images predicted lower externalizing symptoms. Moreover, interactions between the LPP and stress continued to predict externalizing symptoms 8 months after the hurricane. Conclusions Results indicate that heightened neural reactivity and attention toward unpleasant information, as measured by the LPP, predispose children to psychiatric symptoms when exposed to higher levels of stress related to natural disasters, while greater reactivity to and processing of pleasant information may be a protective factor.",0.637831225

However, it is unknown how these work characteristics are associated with different trajectories of depressive symptoms, which this study aimed to examine.We included 6679 subjects in the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH), who completed biennial questionnaires in 2006-2016. Group-based trajectory models identified groups with similar development of depressive symptoms. Multinomial logistic regression estimated associations between baseline demands, control, social support and trajectories of depressive symptoms.We identified six depression trajectories with varying severity and stability across four measurements. High job demands and low social support, but not low control, were associated with higher probability of belonging to subsequent trajectories with higher symptom level compared to very low symptom level. Adjusted risk ratios ranged from 1.26, 95% CI = 1.06-1.51 (low symptom trajectory) to 2.51, 95% CI = 1.43-4.41 (persistent severe symptom trajectory). Results also indicated that onset of high demands, low control and low social support increases depressive symptoms over time.The results were based on self-reported data and all individuals did not have complete data in all waves.The results indicated that especially perceptions of high job demands and low social support are associated with higher or increasing levels of depressive symptoms over time. This support the supposition that high job demands, and low social support may have long-term consequences for depressive symptoms and that interventions targeting job demands and social support may contribute to a more favourable course of depression.",0.63737174

The present longitudinal study seeks to find the longitudinal patterns of cannabis use as precursors of PTSD symptoms. Such information will serve as a guide for intervention programs for PTSD. Methods Growth mixture modeling was conducted to identify the cannabis use trajectory groups using a community sample of 674 participants (53% African Americans, 47% Hispanics of Puerto Rican decent; 60% females) from the Harlem Longitudinal Development Study. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association between earlier trajectories of cannabis use (ages 14 to 36) and later symptoms of PTSD (at age 36) for the full model including the entire sample ( N = 674) as well as the reduced model including only participants who had experienced a traumatic event ( n = 205). Results Five trajectory groups of cannabis use were obtained. The chronic use group (full model: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.68, P &lt; .01; reduced model: AOR = 4.27, P &lt; .05), the late quitting group (full model: AOR = 6.18, P &lt; .01; reduced model: AOR = 6.67, P &lt; .01), and the moderate use group (full model: AOR = 3.97, P &lt; .01; reduced model: AOR = 3.32, P &lt; .05) were all associated with an increased likelihood of having PTSD symptoms at age 36 compared with the no use group. Conclusions The findings provide information that PTSD symptoms in the mid-30s can possibly be reduced by decreasing membership in the chronic cannabis use trajectory group, the late quitting trajectory group, and the moderate cannabis use trajectory group.",0.637330703

Growth mixture models (GMM) were fitted to classify individuals into different trajectories for three mental health-related outcomes (psychological distress, personal growth and loneliness). Moreover, we fitted a multinomial regression model for each outcome considering class membership as the independent variable to assess the association with the predictors.For the outcomes studied we identified three latent trajectories, differentiating two major trends, a large proportion of participants was classified into 'resilient' trajectories, and a smaller proportion into 'chronic-worsening' trajectories. For the former, we observed a lower susceptibility to the changes, whereas, for the latter, we noticed greater heterogeneity and susceptibility to different periods of the pandemic. From the multinomial regression models, we found global and cognitive health, and coping strategies as common protective factors among the studied mental health components. Nevertheless, some differences were found regarding the risk factors. Living alone was only significant for those classified into 'chronic' trajectories of loneliness, but not for the other outcomes. Similarly, secondary or higher education was only a risk factor for the 'worsening' trajectory of personal growth. Finally, smoking and sleeping problems were risk factors which were associated with the 'chronic' trajectory of psychological distress.Our results support heterogeneity in reactions to the pandemic and the need to study different mental health-related components over a longer follow-up period, as each one evolves differently depending on the pandemic period. In addition, the understanding of modifiable protective and risk factors associated with these trajectories would allow the characterisation of these segments of the population to create targeted interventions.",0.637292015

Participants at Time 1 were 602 adults who reported directly experiencing a transportation accident within the past year ( M months = 6.36; SD months = 3.20). Of these participants, 171 adults completed the follow‐up survey after 3 months (Time 2). Finite mixture modeling was conducted to identify the heterogeneity of PTSS in relation with PGI at each time point. At Time 1, a four‐class model was the best‐fitting model, and at Time 2, a three‐class model was the best‐fitting model. As hypothesized, when examined cross‐sectionally, various subgroups were identified at each time point, finding subgroups with moderate to high levels of PGI but differing in their PTSS. However, when examining the longitudinal changes in class membership from Time 1 to Time 2, members of subgroups with higher PGI skills at Time 1 were more likely to be assigned to subgroups with lower PTSS at Time 2. The current study suggests a potential application of PGI skills in alleviating PTSS after a transportation accident and having a critical role in adjustment after hardship.",0.637086176

Few studies have been conducted to examine patterns of longitudinal course of negative symptoms in the early stage of illness. Differential relationships of negative symptom trajectories with long-term clinical and functional outcomes remain to be clarified. This study aimed to investigate patterns of negative symptom trajectories over 3 years, utilizing latent class growth analysis (LCGA), in patients presenting with first-episode non-affective psychosis. Predictive capacity of symptom trajectories on 13-year functional and negative symptom outcomes was also examined. One hundred thirty-six Chinese patients aged 18–55 years presenting with DSM-IV first-episode schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, brief psychotic disorder or delusional disorder were assessed at clinical stabilization for first psychotic episode (baseline), 1, 2, 3 and 13 years of follow-up. Assessments encompassing premorbid adjustment, baseline symptom and cognitive profiles and functional levels were conducted. Negative symptoms were measured by High Royds Evaluation of Negativity (HEN) Scale. Individual class membership of negative symptoms derived from LCGA was based on HEN ratings at baseline, 1, 2 and 3-year follow-up. Three distinct negative symptom trajectories were identified including low-stable (59.6%, n=81), moderate-stable (29.4%, n=40) and high-increasing (11.0%, n=15) trajectories. Multinomial regression analysis revealed that poorer premorbid adjustment, lower baseline cognitive composite scores and more severe baseline depression predicted high-increasing trajectory membership (Nagelkerke pseudo R2=0.339, Model χ2=277.96, p<0.01). At 13 years, 88 patients (64.7%) completed follow-up assessment, with attrition analysis indicating lack of significant differences in demographic, premorbid and baseline characteristics between completers and non-completers. Analysis of covariance (controlling for premorbid adjustment, baseline cognition and depression) followed by post-hoc comparison analyses found that high-increasing trajectory was significantly associated with poorer global functional outcome and higher negative symptom levels at 13-year follow-up. Our results indicate that 11% of first-episode non-affective psychosis patients displayed persistently high levels of negative symptoms with gradual symptom worsening over 3-year follow-up. This trajectory membership was predictive of poorer negative symptom and functional outcomes 13 years after presentation. High-increasing negative symptom trajectory identified in the initial 3 years of treatment for first-episode psychosis may represent a subgroup of patients having markedly elevated risk of developing deficit syndrome in the later course of illness.",0.637061223

Methods: We use group-based trajectory models to study 2361 PCIs for GHS and 1927 PCIs for DS from the National Health and Aging Trends Survey 2011-2018, and apply multinomial logistic regressions to predict identified latent trajectory group memberships using individual characteristics. Results: For both GHS and DS, there were six groups of PCIs with distinct trajectories over a 7-year period. More than 40% PCIs experienced sharp declines in GHS, and 35.5% experienced persistently poor GHS. There was greater heterogeneity in DS trajectories with 55% PCIs experiencing improvement, 16.4% experiencing persistently high DS, and 30.5% experiencing deterioration. Discussion: The GHS trajectories illustrate the heavy burden of poor and declining health among PCIs. Further research is needed to understand the factors underlying stable or improving DS despite declining GHS.",0.636973451

Participants completed the Patient Heath Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Perceived Social Support Scale, the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, and APGAR-family scale. Distinct patterns of depression and anxiety trajectories were established through grouping participants based on time-varying changes of the cut-off score. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine predictors for trajectory membership.Depression and anxiety prevalence during the COVID-19 outbreak were 21.3% and 11.5% respectively, and symptoms worsened as the lockdown time increased. Five depression/anxiety trajectories were observed: resistance, recovery, relapsing/remitting, delayed-dysfunction and chronic-dysfunction. Gender, academic year, residence location, history of mental health, and COVID-19 community exposure were significant predictors of distinct trajectories for depression or anxiety. Less social support or positive coping, more negative coping, and poorer family function were also risk predictors for not developing delayed or chronic dysfunction.Although most adolescents remain euthymic or recover over time, some adolescents, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibit delayed or chronic symptoms. Thus, the need for individualized intervention with these adolescents is indicated.",0.636737256

Stress is known to relate to greater reported IBD symptoms, but little is known about the longitudinal experience of stress and clinical symptoms of youth newly diagnosed with IBD.Fifty-seven children (Mage = 14.26, range 8-17 years) diagnosed with IBD completed measures assessing psychological stress (PROMIS Psychological Stress Experiences), depressive symptoms (Children's Depression Inventory-2), and clinical disease symptoms (Self-Report Disease Activity) within 45 days of diagnosis and at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to describe trajectory patterns of psychological stress over the first year of diagnosis and logistic regression identified predictors of group membership.Two distinct groups of psychological stress trajectories were identified: 1) low prevalence over the first year of diagnosis (51%) and 2) moderate and increasing prevalence (49%). Membership in the moderate and increasing psychological stress group was associated with female sex and greater IBD symptoms at diagnosis.Findings suggest roughly half of youth newly diagnosed with IBD would likely benefit from multidisciplinary assessment and intervention to promote adaptive stress management, given moderate and increasing stress levels. Future research is needed to evaluate specific intervention techniques most helpful to youth with IBD.",0.636722763

However, few studies have followed-up participants as the pandemic evolved and examined both between and within person predictors of symptom trajectories. In the current study, adolescents and young adults (N=532) in New York were surveyed monthly between March 27th and July 14th, 2020, a period spanning the first peak and subsequent decline in COVID-19 infection rates in the region. Surveys assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Child Depression Inventory and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, as well as experiences related to the pandemic. Multilevel growth modeling indicated that symptoms of depression and anxiety peaked around late April/early May and then decreased through May-July. Some pandemic experiences followed a similar quadratic trajectory, while others decreased linearly across the study. Specific relationships emerged between some types of pandemic experiences and depression and anxiety symptoms. While symptoms of depression and anxiety in youth may have been elevated early in the pandemic, these findings suggest they subsided across Spring-Summer of 2020, with higher levels of both corresponding to a period of peak infection rates and decreases paralleling the decline in pandemic experiences and COVID-19 infection rates.",0.636611626

Exposed and non-exposed mothers were identified based on the criteria published by the WHO Maternal Morbidity Working Group.The primary outcome measure of this study was trajectories of health-related quality of life. The Stata Traj package was used to determine the trajectories using a group-based trajectory modelling. Multinomial logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of trajectory membership.Four distinct trajectories for physical and psychological and five trajectories for the social relationships and environmental health-related quality of life were identified. Direct and indirect maternal morbidities, lower educational status, poor social support, being government employed and merchant/student in occupation, vaginal delivery, lower monthly expenditure, stress, fear of childbirth and anxiety were found to be predictors of lower health-related quality of life trajectory group membership.Health professionals should target maternal morbidities and mental health problems when developing health intervention strategies to improve maternal health-related quality of life in the postpartum period.

Methods Data came from 2445 cognitively healthy persons aged 60 or older in the 2006 to 2012 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging. Using Korean–mini mental status examination (K‐MMSE) as a measure of global cognitive function, the latent growth mixture modeling approach examined potential heterogeneity of longitudinal changes over the 6 years. Results This study found that older Koreans reported an average K‐MMSE score of 27 at baseline and experienced a cognitive decline every 2 years by −1.6 (2006‐2008) and −1.2 (2008‐2010), followed by a slight increase of 0.7 in 2012. Results from the latent growth mixture modeling analysis indicated that there were 2 heterogeneous classes of longitudinal changes in the K‐MMSE over a period of 6 years: class 1 with stable cognitive function and class 2 with sharp cognitive decline over time. The sharp decline was found among those older in age and with higher level of depression at baseline. On the contrary, being male, higher education, active social engagement, and regular exercise were main characteristics of stable cognitive function. Conclusion As the first to examine cognitive trajectories among older Koreans, this study highlighted heterogeneity of cognitive trajectories in the population that should be considered for developing differential intervention strategies aimed at both promoting healthy brain and delaying/preventing cognitive decline.",0.636080059

However, it has been hypothesized that in extreme situations such as major disasters where positive expectations cannot overcome the grim reality on the ground, being optimistic might be a disadvantage. To test this mismatch hypothesis, this study explores whether higher pre-disaster dispositional optimism is associated with higher posttraumatic stress (PTS) and depressive symptoms among individuals who experienced the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. Information on optimism was collected from community-dwelling residents aged ≥65 years seven months before the 2011 Earthquake/Tsunami in Iwanuma, a Japanese city located 80-km from the epicenter. Data on disaster-related personal experiences (e.g., loss of relatives or friends/housing damage), as well as depressive and PTS symptoms, were collected during a follow-up survey in 2013, 2.5 years after the earthquake and tsunami. Multiple logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate the associations between disaster experiences, optimism, and depressive/PTS symptoms among 962 participants. Higher pre-disaster dispositional optimism was associated with lower odds of developing depressive symptoms (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.95) and PTS symptoms (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.99) after the earthquake. Contrary to the mismatch hypothesis, high dispositional optimism buffered the adverse impact of housing damage on depressive symptoms (interaction term coefficient = −0.63, p = 0.0431), but not on PTS symptoms. In contrast to the mismatch hypothesis, the results suggest that dispositional optimism is a resilience resource among survivors of a disaster.",0.636074193

We sought to characterize depression symptom trajectories over six months among older residents, and to identify resident characteristics at baseline that predict symptom trajectory. Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of data from a six-month prospective, observational, and multi-site study. Severity of depressive symptoms was assessed with the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) at baseline and with up to six monthly follow-up assessments. Participants were 130 residents with a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 15 or more at baseline and of at least two of the six monthly follow-up assessments. Individual resident GDS trajectories were grouped using hierarchical clustering. The baseline predictors of a more severe trajectory were identified using the Proportional Odds Model. Results: Three clusters of depression symptom trajectory were found that described “lower,” “intermediate,” and “higher” levels of depressive symptoms over time (mean GDS scores for three clusters at baseline were 2.2, 4.9, and 9.0 respectively). The GDS scores in all groups were generally stable over time. Baseline predictors of a more severe trajectory were as follows: Initial GDS score of 7 or more, female sex, LTC residence for less than 12 months, and corrected visual impairment. Conclusions: The six-month course of depressive symptoms in LTC is generally stable. Most residents who experience a more severe symptom trajectory can be identified at baseline.",0.635966904

This longitudinal study aimed to identify sick leave trajectories among patients before, during and after work-focused treatment, in all 29.5 months. We then aimed to determine the background and clinical characteristics of these trajectory groups.Background and clinical data were collected by patient self-report (N=619) in an observational study in a specialised mental healthcare clinic. Sick leave was recorded from national registry data. A latent growth mixture model identified trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression determined differences in background characteristics while a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) identified clinical differences.We identified three trajectories: The 'Resilient' group (47.7%) had low sick leave throughout the period. The two other groups ('Recovery', 31.8% and 'High risk', 20.5%) had similar pretreatment trajectories: lower sick leave one year prior which increased to high sick leave at the start of treatment. After treatment, the 'Recovery' group made an almost full return to work while the 'High risk' group remained at high sick leave. The two groups with high sick leave had more women and higher age compared with the 'Resilient' group. All groups had similar clinical scores at the start of treatment, but the 'High risk' groups had residual depressive symptoms at the end of treatment. Effect sizes for anxiety and depression were moderate or large for all groups, (Cohen's d=0.74-1.81), and 87.2% of the total sample were fully working one year after treatment.We found three subgroups with distinctly different trajectories. Female gender and higher age were associated with high sick leave at the start of treatment, while residual depressive symptoms at the end of treatment predicted continued sick leave. The study points to the possibility of improving patient outcomes in the future by stratifying and tailoring treatment to patient characteristics.",0.635648188

However, few studies have utilized a large multisite dataset to understand this complex relationship. Our study assessed the relationship between alcohol and cannabis use trajectories and PTSD and depression symptoms across 3 months in recently trauma-exposed civilians.In total, 1618 (1037 female) participants provided self-report data on past 30-day alcohol and cannabis use and PTSD and depression symptoms during their emergency department (baseline) visit. We reassessed participant's substance use and clinical symptoms 2, 8, and 12 weeks posttrauma. Latent class mixture modeling determined alcohol and cannabis use trajectories in the sample. Changes in PTSD and depression symptoms were assessed across alcohol and cannabis use trajectories via a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance.Three trajectory classes (low, high, increasing use) provided the best model fit for alcohol and cannabis use. The low alcohol use class exhibited lower PTSD symptoms at baseline than the high use class; the low cannabis use class exhibited lower PTSD and depression symptoms at baseline than the high and increasing use classes; these symptoms greatly increased at week 8 and declined at week 12. Participants who already use alcohol and cannabis exhibited greater PTSD and depression symptoms at baseline that increased at week 8 with a decrease in symptoms at week 12.Our findings suggest that alcohol and cannabis use trajectories are associated with the intensity of posttrauma psychopathology. These findings could potentially inform the timing of therapeutic strategies.",0.635585802

We aimed to understand whether Taiwanese older adults’ disability trajectories mediated the association between disablement process factors and later long-term care (LTC) service use. Data were from the nationally representative Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging Survey, 1996–2007 (N = 3,429). Trajectories of disability in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living were identified by using growth mixture modeling. Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the effect of disability trajectory as mediator on disablement process factors, such as demographics, number of comorbidities, depression, and leisure activities (LAs), and on later LTC service use. Three distinct disability trajectories were identified among the group of surveyed older adults: healthy (N = 2,998, 87.43 %), progressive disability (N = 363, 10.59 %), and maintained disability (N = 68, 1.98 %). These disability trajectories, either progressive disability or maintained disability trajectory, were found to have a positive mediating effect on the association between disablement process factors (older, lower educational attainment, larger number of comorbidities, and depressive symptoms) and greater use of LTC services. However, encouraging older adults to engage in LAs reduced later use of LTC services through both total and significant mediating effect of postponing development of disability trajectory in older Taiwanese adults. These findings suggest that an active lifestyle is important for older adults’ physical health and to decrease the societal burden of LTC service use.",0.635453763

Method We conducted a latent growth mixture model (LGMM) to identify the change trajectories of 44 clients’ depression scores during psychotherapy. Client characteristics were then explored to determine whether any were associated with change trajectories. We examined whether the number of physician visits and/or client self‐concealment scores predict 63 clients’ improvement after controlling for initial symptom severity. Results Two trajectories of clients’ symptom change were identified: nonimprovers (52.3%) and improvers (47.7%). Nonimprovers had higher levels of self‐concealment and baseline depression than improvers. The number of physician visits was associated with higher depression scores at baseline and greater clinical improvement during psychotherapy. Conclusion Clients showed distinct trajectories of symptom change in psychotherapy. Early identification of clients at risk for treatment failure may increase the probability of therapeutic success.,0.635349192

Our aim was to identify longitudinal QOL trajectories and determine and predict the sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics of trajectory membership in physical trauma patients using a biopsychosocial approach. Methods Patients completed a questionnaire set after inclusion, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months follow-up. Trajectories were identified using repeated-measures latent class analysis. The trajectory characteristics were ranked using Cohen’s d effect size or phi coefficient. Results Altogether, 267 patients were included. The mean age was 54.1 (SD = 16.1), 62% were male, and the median injury severity score was 5.0 [2.0—9.0]. Four latent trajectories were found for psychological health and environment, five for physical health and social relationships, and seven trajectories were found for overall QOL and general health. The trajectories seemed to remain stable over time. For each QOL domain, the identified trajectories differed significantly in terms of anxiety, depressive symptoms, acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, Neuroticism, trait anxiety, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness.

Among the children who presented with ODD during preschool age, three trajectories of irritability symptoms resulted (high-persistent 31.9%, decreasing 34.9% and increasing 33.2%). Null, low-persistent and decreasing irritability courses in the sample as a whole gave very similar discriminative capacity for children's psychopathological state at age 6, while the increasing and high-persistent categories involved poorer clinical outcomes than the null course. For ODD children, the high-persistent and increasing trajectories of irritability predicted disruptive behavior disorders, comorbidity, high level of functional impairment, internalizing and externalizing problems and low anger control at age 6.Irritability identifies a subset of ODD children at high risk of poorer longitudinal psychopathological and functional outcomes. It might be clinically relevant to identify this subset of ODD children with a high number of irritability symptoms throughout development with a view to preventing comorbid and future adverse longitudinal outcomes.",0.634583782

This article describes how latent class growth modelling (LCGM) can be performed in intervention studies, using an empirical example, and discusses the challenges and potential implications of this method. The analysis included 110 young adults with mobility disability that had participated in a parallel randomized controlled trial and received either a mobile app program (n = 55) or a supervised health program (n = 55) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was accelerometer measured moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels in min/day assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1-year post intervention. The mean change of MVPA from baseline to 1-year was estimated using paired t-test. LCGM was performed to determine the trajectories of MVPA. Logistic regression models were used to identify potential predictors of trajectories. There was no significant difference between baseline and 1-year MVPA levels (4.8 min/day, 95% CI: -1.4, 10.9). Four MVPA trajectories, 'Normal/Decrease', 'Normal/Increase', 'Normal/Rapid increase', and 'High/Increase', were identified through LCGM. Individuals with younger age and higher baseline MVPA were more likely to have increasing trajectories of MVPA. LCGM uncovered hidden trajectories of physical activity that were not represented by the average pattern. This approach could provide significant insights when included in intervention studies. For higher accuracy it is recommended to include larger sample sizes.",0.634499221

The objective of this study was to investigate the trajectories in pain severity and functional interference following non-catastrophic musculoskeletal (MSK) trauma in an international, mixed injury sample. Methods A prospective longitudinal cohort ( n = 241) was formed from patients identified within four weeks of trauma, from attendance at emergency or urgent care centres located in London, ON, Canada, or Chicago, IL, USA. Pain interference was measured via the Brief Pain Inventory (London cohort) or the Neck Disability Index (Chicago cohort). Pain severity was captured in both cohorts using the numeric pain rating scale. Growth mixture modeling and RM repeated measures ANOVA approaches identified distinct trajectories of recovery within pain interference and pain severity data. Results For pain interference, the three trajectories were labeled accordingly: Class 1 = Rapid recovery (lowest intercept, full or near full recovery by 3 months, 32.0% of the sample); Class 2 = Delayed recovery (higher intercept, recovery by 12 months, 26.7% of the sample); Class 3 = Minimal or no recovery (higher intercept, persistently high interference scores at 12 months, 41.3% of the sample). For pain severity, the two trajectories were labeled: Class 1 = Rapid recovery (lower intercept, recovery by 3 months, 81.3% of the sample); and Class 2 = Minimal or no recovery (higher intercept, flat curve, 18.7% of the sample). The “Minimal or No Recovery” trajectory could be predicted by female sex and axial (vs. peripheral) region of trauma with 74.3% accuracy across the 3 classes for the % Interference outcome. For the Pain Severity outcome, only region (axial trauma, 81.3% accuracy) predicted the “Minimal or No Recovery” trajectory. Conclusions These results suggest that three meaningful recovery trajectories can be identified in an international, mixed-injury sample when pain interference is the outcome, and two recovery trajectories emerge when pain severity is the outcome. Females in the sample or people who suffered axial injuries (head, neck, or low back) were more likely to be classed in poor outcome trajectories.

The aims of this study were to investigate acute postoperative pain trajectories, their predictors, and their impact on long- term outcomes in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. Methods . We evaluated the preoperative pain intensity, use of analgesics, psychosocial measures and physical functioning of adolescents scheduled to undergo spinal fusion, and their average 6-hour self-reported pain intensity scores for their entire hospital stay. Six months after surgery, baseline variables were reassessed. We used growth mixture modeling to conduct acute postoperative pain trajectory analysis and to identify predictors of pain trajectories. Generalized linear models were conducted to determine whether acute pain trajectories predict long-term outcomes. Results . One hundred and six patients were included in the best-fitted acute pain trajectory model that included four classes that differed in initial pain intensity and rates of change over time. Preoperative pain catastrophizer status and use of analgesics significantly predicted pain trajectory membership. Furthermore, at the 6-month follow-up, patients experiencing moderate-to-severe pain in the acute postoperative period were more likely to report higher levels of pain severity, use pain medication, and miss a greater number of school/work days due to back pain in the last three months. Discussion . Preoperative assessment and analyzing the progression of pain in the acute postoperative period can help identify those at risk of negative long-term outcomes after surgery.",0.634428898

However, in previous research those benefits were small, and reinforcement to maintain them was not effective. A possible explanation is that the benefits appeared to be small and reinforcement appeared to be ineffective because those analyses mixed data from two latent groups: one group of people who needed reinforcement and one group of people who did not. The hypothesis is that mixing the data from those two different groups caused the true effects to be “diluted.” Methods To test that hypothesis we used data from the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program in Japan, focusing on anxiety, depression, and patient-physician communication. To identify latent trajectories of change after the program, we used growth-mixture modeling. Then, to find out which baseline factors were associated with trajectory-group membership, we used logistic regression. Results Growth-mixture modeling revealed two trajectories—two groups that were defined by distinct patterns of change after the program. One of those patterns was improvement followed by backsliding: decay of impact. On anxiety and depression the decay of impact was large enough to be clinically important, and its prevalence was as high as 50%. Next, logistic regression analysis revealed that being in the decay-of-impact group could be predicted from multimorbidity, low self-efficacy, and high scores on anxiety or depression at baseline. In addition, one unexpected finding was an association between multimorbidity and better patient-physician communication. Conclusions These results support the hypothesis that previous findings (i.e., apparently small effect sizes and apparently ineffective reinforcement) actually reflect “dilution” of large effects, which was caused by mixing of data from distinct groups. Specifically, there was one group with decay of impact and one without. Thus, evaluations of health education should include analyses of trajectory-defined groups. These results show how the group of people who are most likely to need reinforcement can be identified even before the educational program begins. Extra attention and reinforcement can then be tailored. They can be focused specifically to benefit the people with the greatest need.",0.634412621

We sought to assess the relationship between patient self-reported resilience traits and functional and psychosocial outcomes 6 months after traumatic injury.Adult trauma patients 18 years to 64 years of age with moderate to severe injuries (Injury Severity Score, ≥9) admitted to one of three Level I trauma centers between 2015 and 2017 were contacted by phone at 6 months postinjury and asked to complete a validated Trauma Quality of Life (T-QoL) survey and PTSD screen. Patients were classified into ""low"" and ""high"" resilience categories. Long-term outcomes were compared between groups. Adjusted logistic regression models were built to determine the association between resilience and each of the long-term outcomes.A total of 305 patients completed the 6-month interview. Two hundred four (67%) of the 305 patients were classified as having low resilience. Mean age was 42 ± 14 years, 65% were male, 91% suffering a blunt injury, and average Injury Severity Score was 15.4 ± 7.9. Patients in the low-resilience group had significantly higher odds of functional limitations in activities of daily living (odds ratio [OR], 4.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.48-9.34). In addition, patients in the lower resilience group were less likely to have returned to work/school (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.71-6.19), more likely to report chronic pain (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.54-4.30) and more likely to screen positive for PTSD (OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.58-5.54).Patients with low resilience demonstrated worse functional and psychosocial outcomes 6 months after injury. These data suggest that screening for resilience and developing and deploying early interventions to improve resilience-associated traits as soon as possible after injury may hold promise for improving important long-term functional outcomes.Prognostic, level II.",0.634348691

In a randomized controlled trial, an online expressive writing intervention for Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans with reintegration difficulties reduced distress relative to control conditions, albeit with small between-group effect sizes (Sayer, Noorbaloochi et al., 2015). The aims of this study were to further explore changes in distress severity in the parent study's experimental group by identifying subgroups with similar trajectories and examining predictors of those trajectories.We used latent class growth modeling to identify trajectories of change in distress among veterans randomized into expressive writing (N = 508). We also tested six predictors of trajectory membership: baseline probable PTSD, social support, combat exposure, sex, VA user status, and active-duty versus National Guard/Reserve status. The sample was mostly White, middle-aged, Army veterans deployed from active duty, all of whom reported reintegration difficulties.A four-class model, with the following classes, best fit the data: Low Baseline Distress-Moderate Decrease (60%; Cohen's d = -0.69), Moderate Baseline Distress-No Change (25%; Cohen's d = -0.16), Severe Baseline Distress-Small Increase (10%; Cohen's d = 0.23), and Severe Baseline Distress-Very Large Decrease (5%; Cohen's d = -4.80). Veterans without probable PTSD, with less combat exposure, and with higher social support were more likely to be in classes with decreasing distress.Analyses revealed several subgroups with unique patterns of change. Non-therapist-assisted expressive writing may be most suitable for veterans with less complex psychosocial problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",0.634210364

Finding that an individual's emotional response during the disaster plays an important role in the development of depressive symptoms suggests that reduction of exposure to traumatic stress during a storm (i.e., evacuation from a storm area) is important for older people. Likewise, immediate interventions following a disaster that target people experiencing high levels of peri-traumatic distress may be particularly effective and that failing to attend to these people may miss a critical opportunity and result in years of suffering.",0.634180246

The current study attempted to explore trajectories of child abuse and predictors in a Chinese community sample based on a longitudinal study. Three waves of data were collected from 521 caregivers who had children aged 4–7 years with caregiver-reported questionnaires. An unconditional growth mixture model analysis was used to examine developmental trajectories, and a conditional growth mixture model analysis was conducted to examine predictors for trajectories. The results showed that changes in child abuse, physical abuse, and emotional abuse over time were heterogeneous, including in the None to Low class (93.8 %, 93.6 %, and 92.4 %) and the Sustained Abuse class (6.2 %, 6.4 %, and 7.6 %). The children’s sex, caregivers’ education levels, family income, and caregivers’ childhood trauma predicted the classification of child abuse, physical abuse, and emotional abuse (β = −0.72 to 1.32, S.E. = 0.18–0.39, p <.01), e.g., girls and caregivers’ low childhood trauma predicted individuals belonging to the sustained abuse class of physical abuse, and these factors also predicted child abuse within this class (β = −1.28 to 2.85, p <.05). These findings suggest that different subtypes of child abuse may have different trajectories, and prevention strategies should be implemented based on specific subtypes. Additionally, the findings highlight that many more longitudinal studies should be conducted on child abuse and examine changes in abuse over time.",0.634066551

However, little is known about its developmental course and its effect on impairment associated with mental illnesses. We aimed to identify groups of children following differential trajectories of peer victimization from ages 6 to 13 years and to examine predictive associations of these trajectories with mental health in adolescence.Participants were members of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, a prospective cohort of 2120 children born in 1997/98 who were followed until age 15 years. We included 1363 participants with self-reported victimization from ages 6 to 13 years and data available on their mental health status at 15 years.We identified 3 trajectories of peer victimization. The 2 prevailing groups were participants with little or moderate exposure to victimization (441/1685 [26.2%] and 1000/1685 [59.3%], respectively); the third group (244 [14.5%]) had been chronically exposed to the most severe and long-lasting levels of victimization. The most severely victimized individuals had greater odds of reporting debilitating depressive or dysthymic symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-5.17), debilitating generalized anxiety problems (OR 3.27, CI 1.64-6.51) and suicidality (OR 3.46, CI 1.53-7.81) at 15 years than those exposed to the lowest levels of victimization, after adjustment for sex, childhood mental health, family hardship and victimization perpetration. The association with suicidality remained significant after controlling for concurrent symptoms of depression or dysthymia and generalized anxiety problems.Adolescents who were most severely victimized by peers had an increased risk of experiencing severe symptoms consistent with mental health problems. Given that peer victimization trajectories are established early on, interventions to reduce the risk of being victimized should start before enrolment in the formal school system.",0.634001247
https://openalex.org/W2150979753,10.3402/ejpt.v6.27514,"Latent trajectory studies: the basics, how to interpret the results, and what to report","BackgroundIn statistics, tools have been developed to estimate individual change over time. Also, the existence of latent trajectories, where individuals are captured by trajectories that are unobserved (latent), can be evaluated (Muthén & Muthén, 2000 Muthén B., Muthén L. K. Integrating person-centered and variable-centered analyses: Growth mixture modeling with latent trajectory classes. Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. 2000; 24: 882–891.[Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). The method used to evaluate such trajectories is called Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) or Latent Class Growth Modeling (LCGA). The difference between the two models is whether variance within latent classes is allowed for (Jung & Wickrama, 2008 Jung T., Wickrama K. A. S. An introduction to latent class growth analysis and growth mixture modeling. Social and Personality Psychology Compass. 2008; 2: 302–317.[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). The default approach most often used when estimating such models begins with estimating a single cluster model, where only a single underlying group is presumed. Next, several additional models are estimated with an increasing number of clusters (latent groups or classes). For each of these models, the software is allowed to estimate all parameters without any restrictions. A final model is chosen based on model comparison tools, for example, using the BIC, the bootstrapped chi-square test, or the Lo-Mendell-Rubin test.MethodTo ease the use of LGMM/LCGA step by step in this symposium (Van de Schoot, 2015 Van de Schoot R.

Previous research suggests considerable heterogeneity in responses to trauma and loss with varying symptom representations. The purpose of the current study was to (1) identify classes of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom profiles among individuals who were exposed to both trauma and loss due to the Colombian armed conflict and (2) to examine whether sociodemographic, loss and trauma-related characteristics could predict class membership. Three hundred eight victims of internal displacement who had experienced trauma and loss were assessed through measures of PGD (PG-13), PTSD (PCL-C), and social support (DUKE-UNC). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to analyze differential profiles by symptoms of PGD and PTSD and multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze predictors of class membership. LCA revealed a four-class solution: a resilient class (23.6%), a PTSD-class (23.3%), a predominately PGD class (25.3%) and a high distress-class with overall high values of PGD and PTSD (27.8%). Relative to the resilient class, membership to the PGD class was predicted by the loss of a close family member and the exposure to a higher number of assaultive traumatic events, whereas membership to the PTSD class was predicted by the perception of less social support. Compared to the resilient class, participants in the high distress-class were more likely to be female, to have lost a close relative, experienced more accidental and assaultive traumatic events, and perceived less social support. Specific symptom profiles emerged following exposure to trauma and loss within the context of the Colombian armed conflict. Profiles were associated with distinct types of traumatic experiences, the degree of closeness to the person lost, the amount of social support perceived, and gender. The results have implications for identifying distressed subgroups and informing interventions in accordance with the patient’s symptom profile.",0.63321317

The current study aimed to explore whether personality is associated with a course of psychiatric and medical illness over 10 years following trauma. World Trade Center (WTC) responders (N = 532) completed the personality inventory for DSM-5, which measures both broad domains and narrow facets. Responders’ mental and physical health was assessed in the decade following the WTC disaster during annual monitoring visits at a WTC Health Program clinic. Multilevel modeling was used in an exploratory manner to chart the course of health and functioning, and examine associations of maladaptive personality domains and facets with intercepts (initial illness) and slopes (course) of illness trajectories. Three maladaptive personality domains—negative affectivity, detachment and psychoticism—were uniquely associated with initial posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); detachment and psychoticism were also associated with initial functional impairment. Five facets—emotional lability, anhedonia, callousness, distractibility and perceptual dysregulation—were uniquely associated with initial mental and physical health and functional impairment. Anxiousness and depressivity facets were associated with worse initial levels of psychiatric outcomes only. With regard to illness trajectory, callousness and perceptual dysregulation were associated with the increase in PTSD symptoms. Anxiousness was associated with greater persistence of respiratory symptoms. Several personality domains and facets were associated with initial levels and long-term course of illness and functional impairment in a traumatized population. Results inform the role of maladaptive personality in the development and maintenance of chronic mental-physical comorbidity.

The study sample included a total of 669 women from the Women's Injury Study, a 5-year prospective cohort study conducted from 2007 in the Southwest Central region of the US. Pedometer-based step-count data across 18 consecutive months were fitted to a latent growth model (LGM) and a latent class growth model (LCGM).

Three latent subgroups with distinct PA trajectories were identified (low-active (46.8%), somewhat-active (41.3%), and active (11.9%)). Age and body fat percentage at the baseline significantly explained the likelihoods of being in low-active subgroup.

Furthermore, mothers and children are especially vulnerable postdisasters. Despite the rise in the frequency of climate-related disasters and also the threat of disasters (e.g., storms that threaten but do not make landfall), little is known about how predisaster experiences are associated with mothers' and children's postdisaster psychological functioning. This study examined evacuation-related stressors as predictors of mothers' and youths' psychological functioning 3 months after Hurricane Irma.Mothers (N = 535; 33% ethnic/racial minorities) from South Florida counties most affected by Hurricane Irma completed an online survey that assessed evacuation-related stressors (both pre- and posthurricane), hurricane exposure (i.e., life threat, loss/disruption), and posthurricane social support and mental health symptomatology (i.e., PTSS, anxiety, depression). Mothers of children aged 7-17 years (n = 226) also reported on their child's psychological functioning.Using a risk and resilience model, evacuation stressors significantly predicted mothers' and youths' PTSS and symptoms of anxiety and depression, even after accounting for demographic factors, hurricane exposure, and availability of social support. Mothers of older children also reported significantly higher levels of PTSS, anxiety, and depression than mothers who only had young children (aged 6 or younger) at home.Evacuation experiences represent significant stressors that may put mothers and children at risk for PTSS and psychological distress. Resilience-building efforts should include efforts to better prepare families for prestorm evacuations, thereby reducing risk in mothers and youth and ultimately contributing to better psychosocial functioning.

Seventy-five patients undergoing thoracoscopic lung resection for diagnosed or suspected pulmonary malignancy prospectively recorded daily symptom severity on a 0–10 numeric scale using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory until the first post-discharge clinic visit. The causes of postoperative distresses were surveyed, and symptom severity trajectories were analyzed using joinpoint regression. A rebound was defined as a statistically significant positive slope after a statistically significant negative slope. Symptom recovery was defined as symptom severity of ≤3 in two contiguous measurements. The accuracy of pain severity on days 1–5 for predicting pain recovery was determined using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. We applied Cox proportional hazards models for multivariate analyses of the potential predictors of early pain recovery. The median age was 70 years, and females accounted for 48%. The median interval from surgery to the first post-discharge clinic visit was 20 days. Trajectories of several core symptoms including pain showed a rebound from day 3 or 4. Specifically, pain severity in patients with unrecovered pain had been higher than those with recovered pain since day 4. Pain severity on day 4 showed the highest area under the curve of 0.723 for predicting pain recovery ( P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified pain severity of ≤1 on day 4 as an independent predictor of early pain recovery (hazard ratio, 2.86; P = 0.0027). Duration of symptom was the leading cause of postoperative distress. Several core symptoms after thoracoscopic lung resection showed a rebound in the trajectory. Specifically, a rebound in pain trajectory may be associated with unrecovered pain; pain severity on day 4 may predict early pain recovery. Further clarification of symptom severity trajectories is essential for patient-centered care.",0.632524181

Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we use latent profile analysis to create child maltreatment experience classes and latent growth modeling to understand how classes relate to BMI trajectories from adolescence to early adulthood. The best-fitting model suggests four child maltreatment experience classes: 1) poly-maltreatment (n=607); 2) physical abuse (n=1,578); 3) physical abuse and neglect (n=345); and 4) no childhood maltreatment (n=4,188). Class membership differentially predicts BMI trajectories, such that individuals in the no maltreatment, physical abuse, and physical abuse plus neglect classes exhibit the most stable BMI, and individuals in the poly-maltreatment class increase most rapidly (Χ2[9]=149.9, p < 0.001). Individuals in the poly-maltreatment class experience significantly higher BMI over time compared to the other three classes. In addition to overall growth differing between classes, there is substantial inter-individual variability in BMI trajectories within each class. Because BMI trajectories differ across different childhood maltreatment experiences-and substantial variability in BMI trajectories exists within these different experiences-future analyses should investigate mediators and moderators of this relationship to inform trauma-based therapies and interventions.",0.632406315

Patients' characteristics, including cognitive function, health literacy, and social support were collected as possible baseline predictors of self-care behavior trajectories using a structured questionnaire and an electronic medical record review. Self-care behaviors were evaluated using the Korean version of the nine-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior Scale at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months after hospital discharge. Latent growth model analysis was conducted to identify the homogeneous subgroups with distinct trajectories of self-care behaviors. Subsequently, multinomial logistic regression was used to assess whether baseline predictors were associated with these trajectories in patients with heart failure.Three distinct self-care behavior trajectory groups were identified: ""low-decreased"" (n = 33, 20.9%), ""middle-increased"" (n = 93, 58.9%), and ""high-sustained"" (n = 32, 20.2%). The multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that baseline adequate health literacy and positive social support significantly predicted patients' belonging to both the middle-increased and high-sustained self-care behavior trajectory groups compared to the low-decreased group. Importantly, better cognitive function at baseline was only significantly associated with the high-sustained self-care behavior trajectory compared to the low-decreased trajectory.Our study revealed that only one-fifth of the patients belonged to the high-sustained self-care behavior group 6 months after hospital discharge. Strategies aimed at improving cognitive function, health literacy, and social support should be developed to sustain satisfactory self-care behaviors in patients with heart failure. Further studies with long-term follow-ups are required to identify other possible factors, as well as the baseline predictors of this study affecting longitudinal trajectories of self-care behaviors.Healthcare providers should recognize and evaluate the distinct patterns of self-care behaviors over time in patients with heart failure. Importantly, assessing baseline cognitive function, health literacy, and social support before hospital discharge may be necessary to prevent a decline in self-care behaviors over time.",0.632377274

We integrated multiple indicators of both dimensions to identify social isolation trajectory patterns and investigated how different patterns were related to adults' physical, mental, cognitive, and self-rated health.We used latent class growth modeling to examine social isolation trajectory patterns, based on data from the 2008-2016 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (N = 6457). Mixed-effect linear models were used to examine how trajectory patterns were associated with functional limitations, depressive symptoms, memory deficits, and self-rated health over the 8-year study period.Four social isolation trajectory patterns were identified: severe isolation (15.4%), moderate isolation (37.6%), some objective and rare subjective isolation (35.4%), and rare objective and low subjective isolation (11.6%). Social isolation trajectory patterns showed a gradient in all health domains. The rare objective and low subjective isolation group had the best health (i.e., the fewest functional limitations, depressive symptoms, and memory deficits and the best self-rated health); the some objective and rare subjective isolation group had the next best health; the moderate isolation group had the second worst health; and the severe isolation group had the worst health.The prevalence and stability of severe and moderate social isolation suggest it may be necessary to address social isolation at the national level. The most favorable health outcomes associated with the rare objective and low subjective isolation group supports interventions to strengthen social networks and engagement midlife and later-life.",0.632049513

In 2012-2013, LUTS and impact data were collected for the first time. Accumulation of risk was examined in the following three ways: (1) mean CES-D score across 20 years (5 observations); (2) depressive symptom trajectory group, determined by group-based trajectory modeling; and (3) intercepts and slopes obtained from women's individual CES-D score trajectories through two-stage mixed effects modeling. For each approach, ordinal logistic regression analyses examined odds of having ""greater LUTS/impact"" for each unit change in a depressive symptom variable.(1) With each one-unit increase in mean CES-D score over the 20-year period, women were 9% more likely to report greater LUTS/impact (odds ratio [OR] = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.07-1.11). (2) In comparison with women with consistently low depressive symptoms, women with consistently threshold depression or consistently high depressive symptoms were twice (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.59-2.69) and over five times (OR = 5.55, 95% CI = 3.07-10.06) as likely, respectively, to report greater LUTS/impact. (3) Women's individual symptom intercept and slope interacted. Increases in depressive symptoms across 20 years (greater slopes) were associated with greater LUTS/impact when women's initial CES-D score (intercept) was in the moderate-to-high range relative to the sample.Depressive symptoms over 20 years, examined with different degrees of nuance, were consistently associated with subsequently measured LUTS and impact.",0.631966534

Little research exists, however, to adequately describe trajectories of depressive symptoms during their transition to parenthood, particularly among young fathers. Therefore, we aim to explore trajectories of depressive symptoms from pregnancy through 1 year postpartum among young expectant mothers and their partners. Methods Data are derived from a longitudinal cohort of pregnant adolescent females (ages 14–21; n = 220) and their male partners (n = 190). Multilevel regression models examined the impact of time on depressive symptoms, and generalized linear regression models examined predictors of experiencing elevated depressive symptoms. Results Depressive symptoms significantly decreased from pregnancy through 1 year postpartum among young females. Overall, depressive symptoms did not significantly change over time among young males. Predictors of elevated depressive symptoms common across genders included social support and relationship satisfaction. Marijuana use resulted in almost twice the odds of experiencing elevated depressive symptoms among young fathers (OR 1.82; 95 % CI 1.04, 3.20). Conclusion for Practice Providing strategies for strengthening social support networks among young parents may be an effective way to improve mental health among young parents, particularly during this period of potential social isolation. Additionally, providing tools to strengthen relationships between partners may also be effective for both young mothers and fathers. Substance use may be a marker for depressive symptoms among young fathers and thus screening for substance use could be important to improving their mental health. Future research is needed to better understand how IPV affects mental health, particularly among young fathers.",0.631280512

Parents completed the Parenting Stress Index (PSI), Post-traumatic diagnostic scale, and the Dyadic Adjustment Scale. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the associations of interest.During 4-month follow-up after hospital discharge, parents of infants with 'Never recovered' and 'Partially recovered' growth trajectories had 2-5 times higher odds of experiencing higher stress on the Parent Domain (OR = 4.8, CI = 1.3-18.0; OR = 2.5, CI = 1.0-5.9, respectively) than those with stably grown infants. Parents of ""Never recovered"" infants had 4 times higher odds of PTS symptoms (OR = 3.9; CI = 1.6-9.9). Parental dyadic adjustment moderated the relationships. Parents of 'Partially recovered' infants and having low dyadic adjustment had 3-5 times higher odds of high stress on all PSI domains, while parents with high dyadic adjustment did not have increased stress due to poor infant growth.

The sample comprised 8317 older adults (46.02% men) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Robust structural equation modelling was used to identify symptom trajectories and their relationships with time-varying factors. Trajectory class and covariates were used to predict outcomes (quality of life, satisfaction with life, and daily living functioning) in a 2-year follow-up. Three trajectory classes (so-called, normative, subclinical, chronic symptom trajectories) were identified for both sexes. Rising hearing difficulties and history of psychiatric problems were consistently associated with the chronic symptom trajectory. Lower education level, history of psychiatric problems, and increasing visual difficulties were connected with the subclinical trajectories. Finally, participants with either a subclinical or a chronic symptom trajectory showed worse outcomes than the remaining participants in the follow-up. This study highlighted the presence of varying courses of depression symptoms (each showing some distinctive features from other another) over the old age, pointing to some relevant implications for clinical assessment and treatment prescription.",0.631162967

Large patient data sets using routine outcome measures allows the investigation of treatment effects over time as well as the relationship between outcomes and platform use. Understanding trajectories of symptom change, as well as associated characteristics, may prove important for tailoring interventions or identifying patients who may not benefit from the intervention. Objective We aimed to identify latent trajectories of symptom change during the iCBT treatment course for depression and anxiety and to investigate the patients’ characteristics and platform use for each of these classes. Methods This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial designed to examine the effectiveness of guided iCBT for anxiety and depression in the UK Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) program. This study included patients from the intervention group (N=256) and followed a longitudinal retrospective design. As part of the IAPT’s routine outcome monitoring system, patients were prompted to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) after each supporter review during the treatment period. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify the underlying trajectories of symptom change across the treatment period for both depression and anxiety. Differences in patient characteristics were then evaluated between these trajectory classes, and the presence of a time-varying relationship between platform use and trajectory classes was investigated. Results Five-class models were identified as optimal for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Around two-thirds (PHQ-9: 155/221, 70.1%; GAD-7: 156/221, 70.6%) of the sample formed various trajectories of improvement classes that differed in baseline score, the pace of symptom change, and final clinical outcome score. The remaining patients were in 2 smaller groups: one that saw minimal to no gains and another with consistently high scores across the treatment journey. Baseline severity, medication status, and program assigned were significantly associated (P&lt;.001) with different trajectories. Although we did not find a time-varying relationship between use and trajectory classes, we found an overall effect of time on platform use, suggesting that all participants used the intervention significantly more in the first 4 weeks (P&lt;.001). Conclusions Most patients benefit from treatment, and the various patterns of improvement have implications for how the iCBT intervention is delivered. Identifying predictors of nonresponse or early response might inform the level of support and monitoring required for different types of patients. Further work is necessary to explore the differences between these trajectories to understand what works best for whom and to identify early on those patients who are less likely to benefit from treatment.",0.63113528

Methods: This prospective study used Norwegian administrative registers with quarterly information on labour-market participation to follow all individuals born 1952–1978 who underwent a first LTSA during the first quarter of 2004 ( n =9607) over a 10-year period (2004–2013). Sequence analysis was used to identify prototypical labour-market trajectories and LMA; trajectory membership was examined with multinomial logistic regression. Results: Sequence analysis identified nine labour-market trajectories illustrating the complex RTW process, with multiple states and transitions. Among this sample, 68.2% had a successful return to full-time work, while the remaining trajectories consisted of part-time work, unemployment, recurrence of LTSA, rehabilitation and disability pension (DP). A higher odds ratio (OR) for membership to trajectories of weaker LMA was found for females and older participants, while being married/cohabitating, having children, working in the public sector, and having a higher education, income and occupational class were associated with a lower OR of recurrence, unemployment, rehabilitation and DP trajectories. These results are consistent with three LMA indicators. Conclusions: Sequence analysis revealed prototypical labour-market trajectories and provided a holistic overview of the heterogeneous RTW processes. While the most frequent outcome was successful RTW, several unfavourable labour-market trajectories were identified, with trajectory membership predicted by socio-demographic measures.",0.631129826

  Mixture Models with Nonlinear Trajectories","Growth mixture modeling (GMM) is an analytical tool for identifying multiple unobserved sub-populations of longitudinal processes. In particular, it describes change patterns within each latent sub-population and examines between-individual differences in within-individual change for each sub-group. One research interest in utilizing GMMs is to explore how covariates affect such heterogeneity in change patterns. Liu and Perera (2022c) extended mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which mainly focus on time-invariant covariates, for allowing the covariates to account for within-group and between-group differences simultaneously and examining the heterogeneity in nonlinear trajectories. The present study further extends Liu and Perera (2022c) and examines the effects on trajectory heterogeneity of time-varying covariates (TVCs). Specifically, we propose methods to decompose a TVC into a trait feature (e.g., the baseline value of the TVC) and a set of state features (e.g., interval-specific slopes or changes). The trait features are allowed to account for within-group differences in growth factors of trajectories (i.e., trait effect), and the state features are allowed to impact observed values of a longitudinal process (i.e., state effect). We examine the proposed models using a simulation study and a real-world data analysis. The simulation study demonstrated that the proposed models are capable of separating trajectories into several clusters and generally generating unbiased and accurate estimates with target coverage probabilities. With the proposed models, we showed the heterogeneity in the trait and state features of reading ability across latent classes of students' mathematics performance. Meanwhile, the trait and state effects on mathematics development of reading ability are also heterogeneous across the clusters of students.",0.630835957

Theoretical correlates were examined in relation to the empirically identified trajectories.Data were collected at three time points between 2000 and 2012 from SMW drinkers (n = 434) enrolled in a longitudinal study (M Age = 37.49 at baseline, SD = 11.55). Using an accelerated-cohort longitudinal design, latent growth curve mixture models identified homogeneous patterns of any past-year symptoms of potential AD. Correlates of trajectories included alcohol-related developmental risk factors, adult roles, and exposure to minority stressors.Three trajectories were identified that captured risk of symptoms of potential AD over time, reflecting: (a) relatively consistent, low risk over time; (b) deceleration in risk throughout adulthood; (c) relatively persistent, high risk over time. Consistent with prior work, SMW drinkers who reported higher levels of perceived stigma or masculinity showed persistently high risk of reporting at least one past-year symptom of potential AD.Most SMW drinkers report deceleration in risk of AD symptoms over time. Findings have implications for prevention and intervention efforts tailored to SMW drinkers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",0.630700333

However, the genetic factors that influence risk for early-onset depression remain mostly unknown. Using data collected over 13 years, we examined whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) that capture genetic risk for depression were associated with depression trajectories assessed from childhood to adolescence. Methods Data came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective, longitudinal birth cohort (analytic sample=7,308 youth). We analyzed the relationship between genetic susceptibility to depression and three time-dependent measures of depressive symptoms trajectories spanning 4 to 16.5 years of age (class, onset, and cumulative burden). Trajectories were constructed using a growth mixture model with structured residuals. PRS were generated from the summary statistics of a genome-wide association study of depression risk using data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, UK Biobank, and 23andme, Inc. We used MAGMA to identify gene-level associations with these measures. Results Youth were classified into 6 classes of depressive symptom trajectories: high/renitent (26.5% of youth), high/reversing (5.8%), childhood decrease (6.1%), late childhood peak (3%), adolescent spike (2.5%), and minimal symptoms (56.1%). PRS discriminated between youth in the late childhood peak, high/reversing, and high/renitent classes compared to the minimal symptoms and childhood decrease classes. No significant associations were detected at the gene level. Conclusions This study highlights differences in polygenic loading for depressive symptoms across childhood and adolescence, particularly among youths with high symptoms in early adolescence, regardless of age-independent patterns.",0.630520629

The current survey-based approaches to examining community recovery, however, have significant lags and put the burden of data collection on affected people. Also, the existing literature lacks quantitative measures for important milestones to inform the assessment of recovery trajectory. Recognizing these gaps, this study uses location-based data related to visitation patterns and credit card transactions to specify critical recovery milestones related to population activity recovery. Using data from 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County (Texas), the study specifies four critical post-disaster recovery milestones and calculates quantitative measurements of the length of time between the end of a hazard event and when the spatial areas (census tracts) reached these milestones based on fluctuations in visits to essential and non-essential facilities, and essential and non-essential credit card transactions. Accordingly, an integrated recovery metric is created for an overall measurement of each spatial area's recovery progression. Exploratory statistical analyses were conducted to examine whether variations in community recovery progression in achieving the critical milestones is correlated to its flood status, socioeconomic characteristics, and demographic composition. Finally, the extent of spatial inequality is examined. The results show the presence of moderate spatial inequality in population activity recovery in Hurricane Harvey, based upon which the inequality of recovery is measured. Results of this study can benefit post-disaster recovery resource allocation as well as improve community resilience towards future natural hazards.",0.63046133

Most of the studies identified either 3 or 4 distinct trajectory classes. Trajectories varied in terms of severity (low, medium, high) and stability (stable, increasing, decreasing). In most studies, the majority of participants had consistently few or no depressive symptoms, but a notable minority (usually <10%) reported persistent symptoms. Predictors of trajectories with greater symptom burden included female gender, lower income/education and non-white race. Other predictors were specific to different populations (e.g. mothers, older adults).

Analyses were based on 3936 Dutch pregnant women in Rotterdam area, the Netherlands. Information on potential predictors was collected in early pregnancy by questionnaire. Latent Class Mixture Modelling and Multinomial Logistic Regression were applied to assess the trajectory and predictors of HRQOL during pregnancy. HRQOL was measured by SF-12 in early, mid- and late pregnancy; physical and mental component summary (PCS-12/MCS-12) scores were calculated. Four physical HRQOL trajectories were identified: a healthy trajectory (‘healthy’) in 63.3%, consistently low (‘vulnerable’) in 10.8%; a small increase (‘recovering’) in 12.8% and a large decrease (‘at risk’) in 13.1%. Three mental HRQOL trajectories were identified: a healthy trajectory (‘healthy’) in 86.1%; a large increase (‘recovering’) in 7.5%; and a large decrease (‘at risk’) in 6.4%. Compared with healthy trajectories, the likelihood of following the ‘vulnerable’ physical HRQOL trajectory rather than a healthy trajectory was increased by daily fatigue(OR: 4.82[2.76, 8.40]), pelvic pain (OR:4.76[2.91, 7.78]) and back pain (OR:5.29[3.21, 8.70]); pregnancy-specific anxiety increased the likelihood of following the ‘at risk’ mental HRQOL trajectory (OR:7.95[4.84, 13.05]). Healthy physical and mental HRQOL trajectories during pregnancy were most common. Predictors indicative of poor HRQOL trajectories included pregnancy-related symptoms and anxiety.",0.629949025

A community-based sample of 6- to 8-year-old children (176 boys and 175 girls at baseline) participated in a prospective longitudinal study with three waves of data collection and 1-year interval between subsequent surveys, conducted in the Wielkopolska Province, Poland. Main exposures included nine recent stressful life events and psychosomatic and behavioural symptoms related to stress (SRSs), both self-reported by children. The outcome was total HRQoL assessed by a Polish version of the PedsQL™ 4.0 (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) Generic Core Scales questionnaire, 5- to 7-year-old version. To evaluate the relationship between total HRQoL and predictor variables, a latent growth curve (LGC) model using multiple group design (boys and girls) with three waves and two time-varying covariates, the SLEs and SRSs, was applied. An unconditional multi-group LGC model revealed that the total HRQoL changed over time in a linear trajectory. After incorporating to the model, two time-varying covariates, SLEs and SRSs, the first predictor for HRQoL was only significant at the last wave in girls and at two subsequent waves, except for baseline, in boys. The second predictor revealed significant negative impacts on HRQoL over the entire period of time in both boys and girls suggesting that the pathway underlying the association of SLEs with HRQoL may be mediated by SRSs. Mean values of HRQoL at each time points did not show gender differences.

This study aimed to identify potential trajectories of LH in MHD patients and assess their predictive role in self-management. Methods: This study was conducted in strict compliance with national laws, the Declaration of Istanbul, and the Declaration of Helsinki. A total of 347 MHD patients at a blood purification centre in Hunan Province, China, were selected as the study population. Four longitudinal surveys (baseline and second/fourth/sixth month after baseline) were conducted using the General Information Questionnaire for MHD patients, the Chinese version of the Learned Helplessness Scale for MHD patients, and the Self-Management Scale for Haemodialysis. Latent growth mixture model (LGMM) analysis was used to identify LH trajectories, and their predictors were analysed using multinomial logistic regression. The predictive role of LH trajectory on self-management was analysed using linear regression. Results: This study identified three LH trajectories in MHD patients, named the “high-decreasing group” (57.9%), “low-increasing group” (21.3%), and “low-stability group” (20.7%). The results of the univariate analysis showed that sex (χ 2 =33.777, P < 0.001), age (χ 2 =10.605, P < 0.05), and subjective social status (SSS) (χ 2 =12.43, P < 0.01) were associated with LH trajectory classes. Multinomial logistic regression further demonstrated that gender, age, and SSS were predictors of different LH trajectories. The intercept and slope of the overall LH trajectory were negatively correlated with self-management (β=− 0.273, P < 0.001; β=− 0.234, P < 0.01). Conclusion: MHD patients show three different LH trajectories. The initial level and developmental rate of LH can negatively predict future self-management. It is necessary to screen MHD patients’ LH and develop targeted interventions for them with different LH trajectories at specific stages.

Methods We modeled neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire (NPI‐Q) scores from 4184 volunteers over approximately 4 years using growth mixture models, generating latent classes of trajectory. We then fit Cox proportional hazard models to determine if membership in trajectory classes was associated with increased hazard of diagnosis of MCI or dementia. Results We identified four trajectory classes: the majority of the sample (65%) would be expected to belong to a class with consistently low or zero NPS. The next most prevalent class, (16%) showed a decrease over time in NPI‐Q total score but, compared with the majority class had an almost threefold increase in hazard of MCI or dementia (HR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.82‐4.68). Another class (14%) showed an increase in NPS over time and was also associated with greater hazard of MCI or dementia (HR: 3.96; CI: 2.61‐6.03). The smallest class (5%) had high and fluctuating NPI‐Q total scores and had the greatest hazard (HR: 4.57; CI: 2.72‐7.63). Conclusion We have demonstrated that it is possible to identify meaningful groups of NPS trajectories and that trajectory of NPS can convey information beyond a single cross‐sectional measure. While even those whose NPS improved were at increased hazard of MCI or dementia, hazard increased as a function of the severity of the NPS trajectory.",0.629414813
https://openalex.org/W3081365215,10.1002/jts.22581,A Life‐Course Model of Trauma Exposure and Mental Health Among Low‐Income Survivors of Hurricane Katrina,"Prior research has provided robust evidence that exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) during a disaster is predictive of adverse postdisaster mental health outcomes, including posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and nonspecific psychological distress (PD). However, few studies have explored the role of exposure to other PTEs over the life-course in shaping postdisaster mental health. Based on the broader literature on trauma exposure and mental health, we hypothesized a path analytic model linking predisaster PTEs to long-term postdisaster PTSS and PD via predisaster PD, short-term postdisaster symptoms, and disaster-related and postdisaster PTEs. We tested this model using data from the Resilience in Survivors of Katrina study, a longitudinal study of low-income, primarily non-Hispanic Black mothers exposed to Hurricane Katrina and assessed before the disaster and at time points 1, 4, and 12 years thereafter. The models evidenced a good fit with the data, RMSEA < .01-.04, CFIs > .99. In addition, 44.1%-67.4% of the effect of predisaster PTEs on long-term postdisaster symptoms was indirect. Descriptive differences were observed across models that included PTSS versus PD, as well as models that included all pre- and postdisaster PTEs versus only those that involved assaultive violence. The results suggest the importance of incorporating disaster preparedness in clinical work with trauma survivors and the value in attending to other lifetime PTEs when working in postdisaster contexts.",0.628986079

The aims of this study were to identify latent classes of anxiety symptom trajectories during pregnancy, compare anxiety levels between pregnancy trimesters and ascertain the predictors of anxiety symptom trajectories. Methods: Two hundred pregnant women in their first trimester who attended obstetric clinics at the local hospital were recruited. Three self-report questionnaires assessing anxiety levels were administered at three time points during pregnancy. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify anxiety symptom trajectories, and logistic regression analysis was performed to ascertain the predictors of latent class membership. Results: Data for analyses were available for 188 women. Two anxiety symptom trajectories were identified: a ‘high-anxiety’ trajectory (13.3% of participating women) and ‘low-anxiety’ trajectory (86.7%). This finding was consistent across all the anxiety measures used in the study. Overall, anxiety levels gradually decreased during pregnancy, with a significant decrease between the first and second trimesters on some measures. Past mental disorders and significant stressors in the preceding 6 months predicted membership in the ‘high-anxiety’ trajectory group. Conclusions: These findings support an early assessment of anxiety in pregnant women. If untreated, a high level of anxiety in the first trimester is likely to persist throughout pregnancy, although it may decrease somewhat. An early recognition of pathological anxiety during pregnancy allows its timely treatment and prevention of unfavourable outcomes.",0.627904768

Hence, this study aimed to identify subgroups of adolescents with unique trajectories of change in a school-based depression prevention trial. It was also examined how trajectory membership was associated with the intervention conditions, depressive symptoms at 12-month follow-up, and baseline predictors. Hundred-ninety adolescent girls (Mage = 13.34; range = 11-16 years) with subclinical depression at screening (M = 57 days before pre-test) were allocated to four conditions: a face-to-face, group-based program (OVK), a computerized, individual program (SPARX), OVK and SPARX combined, and a monitoring control condition. Growth Mixture Modeling was used to identify the distinct trajectories during the intervention period using weekly depressive symptom assessments from pre-test to post-test. Analyses revealed three trajectories of change in the full sample: Moderate-Declining (62.1% of the sample), High-Persistent (31.1%), and Deteriorating-Declining (6.8%) trajectories. Trajectories were unrelated to the intervention conditions and the High-Persistent trajectory had worse outcomes at follow-up. Several baseline factors (depression severity, age, acceptance, rumination, catastrophizing, and self-efficacy) enabled discrimination between trajectories. It is concluded that information about likely trajectory membership may enable (school) clinicians to predict an individual's intervention response and timely adjust and tailor intervention strategies as needed.",0.627901106

However, few longitudinal studies have investigated whether self-efficacy predicts the course of posttraumatic recovery beyond lower initial levels of distress. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether general self-efficacy is related to recovery from posttraumatic stress reactions from a longitudinal perspective. A total of 617 Norwegians exposed to the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami completed self-report questionnaires measuring their level of disaster exposure and general self-efficacy at 6 months and posttraumatic stress reactions 6 months and 2 years post-disaster. Predictors of changes in posttraumatic stress reactions were analyzed with multivariate mixed effects models. Self-efficacy at 6 months post-disaster was unrelated to trauma exposure and inversely related to posttraumatic stress reactions at 6 months and 2 years post-disaster. However, self-efficacy was not related to recovery from posttraumatic stress reactions between 6 months and 2 years post-disaster. In conclusion, general self-efficacy is related to lower levels of posttraumatic stress reactions in the first months after a disaster but does not appear to be related to improved recovery rates over the longer term.",0.627891527

However, knowledge is limited regarding the trajectories of OCS during the pandemic, as well as their predictors and mechanisms (e.g., experiential avoidance, EA). The aim of this study was to describe the trajectories of OCS and the identification of associated factors. We assessed 1207 participants of the general population in March 2020 (t1) and June 2020 (t2). Pre-pandemic data was available from March 2014 for a subsample ( n = 519). To define trajectories, we determined OCS status (OCS+/−). We performed a hierarchical multinomial logistic regression to investigate predictors of trajectories. Between t1 and t2, 66% of participants had an asymptomatic trajectory (OCS−/OCS−); 18% had a continuously symptomatic trajectory (OCS+/OCS+). Ten percent had a delayed-onset trajectory (OCS−/OCS+), and the recovery trajectory group (OCS+/OCS−) was the smallest group (6%). Higher education reduced the odds of an OCS+/OCS− trajectory. OCS in 2014 was associated with increased odds of showing an OCS+/OCS+ or OCS−/OCS+ trajectory. When EA at t1 and change in EA from t1 to t2 were added to the model, higher EA at t1 was associated with increased odds of scoring above the cut score on one or more of the assessments. A higher decrease in EA from t1 to t2 reduced the probability of showing an OCS+/OCS+ and an OCS−/OCS+ trajectory. While the current data supports a slight increase in OCS during the pandemic, trajectories differed, and EA seems to represent an important predictor for an unfavorable development.",0.62788639

Predeployment assessment was conducted 4 months before deployment (T1). Of these, 1324 (70.8% retention rate) participated in assessment within 4 months after deployment (T2), and 1122 (60.0%) completed the third time point at 4 years after deployment (T3). PTSD symptoms were assessed with the posttraumatic stress checklist and physical symptoms with a 67-item self-report Health Symptom Checklist. To explore directional influences between symptoms over time, longitudinal cross-lagged association between the modeled latent factors for PTSD symptoms and physical symptoms was estimated using structural equation modeling.From T1 to T2, there was a significant bidirectional effect with higher physical symptom count at T1 predicting higher PTSD symptom severity at T2 ( β = 0.17, p < .001) and higher PTSD symptom severity at T1 predicting higher physical symptom count at T2 ( β = 0.13, p < .001). The effect of T2 on T3 was unidirectional. PTSD symptom severity at T2 had no effect on physical symptom count at T3, but physical symptom count at T2 predicted an increase in PTSD symptom severity at T3 ( β = 0.11, p = .013).Considering early physical symptoms and their physiological underpinnings after traumatic exposures could help identify those at risk of later PTSD.",0.627300435

This has not been explored for one-to-one internet-delivered therapy or functional impairment trajectories. Patients experiencing depression or anxiety received cognitive-behavioural therapy with a therapist using an online chat platform (N = 52,029). Trajectory classes of depression symptoms (PHQ9), anxiety symptoms (GAD7) and functional impairment (WSAS) were investigated using growth mixture modelling. Multinomial regressions tested associations between baseline variables and trajectory class. A four-class trajectory model was selected for each outcome, and these were highly similar. Each outcome showed three classes with initially moderate-severe symptoms or impairment: one demonstrated no change, one gradual improvement and one fast improvement. A fourth class had mild baseline scores and minimal improvement. In the moderate-severe classes, patients in the two with improvement were more likely to be employed and not to have obsessive-compulsive disorder. Fast improvement was likelier than gradual improvement or no change for patients with older age, no disability (e.g., physical, learning), or lower comorbid symptom or impairment scores. Associations with functional impairment classes were more similar to associations with depression classes than anxiety classes. Results were largely consistent with findings from face-to-face therapy. This study is an important step towards personalising therapy in terms of suitability and continuation.",0.627006892

Mental health problems and substance use have also increased during the pandemic, with young adults particularly vulnerable to experiencing these challenges. This study examines trajectories of financial distress among young adults during the pandemic and their associations with depression, anxiety, and hazardous alcohol and cannabis use. Data from 473 young adults (ages 22-29) recruited in the Northwest United States were collected from April/May 2020 to July/August 2021. Financial distress trajectories were identified using growth mixture modeling. Negative binomial models were used to examine associations between financial distress trajectories and distal outcomes of depression, anxiety, alcohol, and cannabis use. Three distinct trajectories were identified, revealing Low, Moderate, and High financial distress experiences. Individuals with ""Moderate"" and ""High"" trajectories showed significantly greater depressive and anxiety symptom scores compared with those in the ""Low"" financial distress trajectory group. Trajectories were not associated with subsequent levels of alcohol or cannabis use. Young adult mental health remains a priority during periods of economic downturn.

Group-based trajectories can be used to understand how eating disorders emerge and evolve over time. The aim of this study was to identify groups of individuals with distinct levels of eating disorder symptoms between 12 and 20 years and the onset of different types of symptoms. We also studied sex differences in the evolution and course of eating disorder symptoms from early adolescence to adulthood.Using archival data from the QLSCD cohort, trajectories of eating disorder symptomatology were estimated from ages 12 to 20 years using semiparametric models. These trajectories included overall eating disorder symptomatology as measured by the SCOFF (Sick, Control, One Stone, Fat, Food), sex, and symptom-specific trajectories.Two groups of adolescents following distinct trajectories of eating disorder symptoms were identified. The first trajectory group included 30.9% of youth with sharply rising levels between 12 and 15 years, followed by high levels of symptoms between 15 and 20 years. The second trajectory group included 69.1% of youth with low and stable levels of symptoms between 12 and 20 years. Sex-specific models indicated that the proportion of girls in the high trajectory group was 1.3 times higher than the proportion of boys (42.8% girls vs. 32.3% boys). Trajectories of SCOFF items were similar for loss-of-control eating, feeling overweight, and attributing importance to food. The weight loss item had a different developmental pattern, increasing between 12 and 15 years and then decreasing between 17 and 20 years.The largest increase in eating disorder symptoms in adolescence is between the ages of 12 and 15 . Yet, most prevention programs start after 15 years of age. Our findings suggest that, unlike common practices, eating disorder prevention programs should aim to start before puberty.Eating disorders, typically involving preoccupation with eating, excessive exercise, and body image issues, are particularly common in adolescence. However, their evolution over time remains unclear as certain signs and symptoms may appear sooner than others. The current study studied the development of eating disorder symptoms in a community cohort followed from birth to adulthood. This study describes trajectories of eating disorder symptoms and risk from age 12 to 20 in both boys and girls. Results showed that the largest increase in eating disorder symptoms occurs between 12 and 15 years of age, both in overall symptomatology as well as in specific symptoms such as loss-of-control when eating, feeling overweight, and attributing importance to food. Additionally, more girls than boys appeared at risk for eating disorders, although the patterns represented by the trajectories were similar in both sexes. Our results highlight the importance of starting early prevention programs before the beginning of adolescence, when symptoms usually start to manifest.",0.62567526

To identify trajectory patterns of maternal depressive symptoms and perceived stress from midpregnancy to 2 years postpartum and determine relationships with selected sociodemographic factors including income, education, immigration, and postpartum employment. Methods. Pregnant women (n = 3307) recruited from the general population in 4 regions in Canada provided 6 waves of data from pregnancy to 2 years postpartum. The study was conducted from 2009 to 2015. Results. We determined 5 trajectory groups distinguished by time and magnitude for both depressive symptoms and perceived stress. Immigrants living in Canada for more than 5 up to 10 years, but not more recent arrivals, were at higher risk for persistent stress and depression independent of income status. Being employed at 1 year postpartum was associated with a lower likelihood of postpartum depression and perceived stress, while mothers reporting work exhaustion were substantially more likely to experience persistent depression and stress. Conclusions. The study highlighted the heterogeneous nature of depressive symptoms and perceived stress. Targeting interventions toward women 5 to 10 years after immigration and those experiencing exhaustion from postpartum work may be particularly beneficial.",0.625449091

Financial hardship, encompassing material losses, financial worry, and poor coping mechanisms, is associated with lower quality of life and increased psychological distress. However, recovery is dynamic and financial hardship may change over time.This is a secondary analysis of a cohort of 500 moderate-to-severe nonneurologic injured patients in which financial hardship and Health-related Quality of Life outcomes were measured at 1, 2, 4, and 12 months after injury using survey instruments (Short Form-36). Enrollment occurred at an urban, academic, Level 1 trauma center in Memphis, Tennessee during January 2009 to December 2011 and follow-up completed by December 2012.Four hundred seventy-four patients had sufficient data for Group- Based Trajectory Analysis. Four distinct financial hardship trajectories were identified: Financially Secure patients (8.6%) had consistently low hardship over time; Financially Devastated patients had a high degree of hardship immediately after injury and never recovered (51.6%); Financially Frail patients had increasing hardship over time (33.6%); and Financially Resilient patients started with a high degree of hardship but recovered by year end (6.2%). At 12-months, all trajectories had poor Short Form-36 physical component scores and the Financial Frail and Financially Devastated trajectories had poor mental health scores compared to US population norms.The Financially Resilient trajectory demonstrates financial hardship after injury can be overcome.

Methods: This retrospective study analyzed hospitalized patients with cancer who died or were discharged from a palliative care unit. Multiple trajectories were estimated using group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) by collecting Functional Independence Measure (FIM) total scores for 8 weeks retrospectively. Results: In total, 306 patients were analyzed. GBTM analysis estimated four groups as the best model for the FIM trajectory over 8 weeks using the following trajectories: (1) the No Decline group, in which ADL did not decline until just before death; (2) the Rapid Decline group, in which ADL declined rapidly 2 weeks before death from a trajectory similar to the No Decline group; (3) the Moderate Disability and Slow Decline group, in which the patient slowly declined from requiring mild to severe assistance; and (4) the Severe Disability group, in which the patient continuously required severe assistance. Conclusions: Multiple ADL trajectories were identified in the last 8 weeks of life of patients with terminal cancer.

However, it remains unclear how coping strategies influence resilience and PTSD development in the acute aftermath of trauma. The current prospective, longitudinal study investigated the relationship between resilience, coping strategies, and the development of chronic PTSD symptoms. A sample of patients was recruited from an emergency department following a Criterion A trauma. Follow-up assessments were completed at 1-, 3-, and 6-months post-trauma to assess PTSD symptom development (N = 164). RESULTS: Resilience at 1-month positively correlated with the majority of active coping strategies (all p < .05) and negatively correlated with the majority of avoidant coping strategies (all p < .05), as well as future PTSD symptoms (p < .001). Additionally, all avoidant coping strategies, including social withdrawal, positively correlated with future PTSD symptoms (all p < .01). After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, social withdrawal at 3-months fully mediated the relationship between resilience at 1-month and PTSD symptoms at 6-months. Limitations include participant drop out and the conceptual overlap between avoidant coping and PTSD. These data suggest that resilience and social withdrawal may be possible therapeutic targets for mitigating the development of chronic PTSD in the aftermath of trauma.",0.624844346

Self-management behaviors change with treatment periods, and the trajectory varies in patients with different demographic and psychosocial characteristics. However, the trajectory patterns and the predictive factors have not been fully studied. Objectives The aim of this study was to identify the trajectory patterns of self-management behaviors in Chinese patients with breast cancer and their predictive factors. Methods A total of 128 patients with breast cancer were recruited. Demographic and disease-related information, self-management behaviors, self-efficacy, coping modes, emotional distress, and social support were investigated across 5 time points. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify the trajectory patterns of self-management behaviors. Logistic regression was used to determine the predictors for membership. Results The best-fit growth mixture modeling revealed a 2-class model; model fit indices were all in acceptable ranges. Class 1 and 2 were named as the group of “stable” (34.38%) and the group of “sharply decreased” (65.62%), respectively, based on the tendency of change. Modified radical mastectomy, avoidance coping mode, anxiety, and low self-efficacy level were predictors of the patients' membership to the sharply decreased group. Conclusion Our study proved the heterogeneity of self-management behaviors and the influencing effect of treatment and psychosocial factors on the development of self-management behaviors in Chinese patients with breast cancer. Implications for Practice Health professionals should pay more attention to patients who are at higher risk of developing a poor self-management pattern.

B-spline smoothers and group-based trajectory modelling were used to identify groups of individuals with similar trajectories of depressive symptoms around retirement. Multinomial regression analyses were conducted to investigate if socio-economic factors were associated with odds of belonging to trajectory groups with higher depression scores.Four depressive symptoms trajectories were identified in both genders, all showing similar symptom levels across the retirement transition. Low levels of depressive symptoms were observed in the three largest groups. In the last trajectory group among women (2.5%) depression scores were moderate to severe and among men (3.3%) depression scores were persistent moderate. Higher educational level and lower subjectively rated social status were associated with higher odds of belonging to trajectory groups with higher levels of depressive symptoms in both genders.Retirement transition was not associated with symptoms of depression.

However, how distress developed during the pandemic and who was most affected is poorly understood. We explore heterogeneity in trajectories of psychological distress during the first six months of the pandemic in the United Kingdom and relate this heterogeneity to socio-demographic and health factors. Subjects and Methods: We analyze six waves of longitudinal, nationally representative survey data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (N = 15,218), covering the first lockdown in 2020. First, latent class mixture modelling (LCCM) is used to identify trajectories of psychological distress. Second, associations of the trajectories with covariates are tested with multinomial logistic regressions. Results: We find four different trajectories of distress: continuously low, continuously moderate, temporarily elevated, and continuously elevated distress. One-fifth of the population experienced severely elevated risks of distress. Long-term exposure was highest among younger people, women, those who lost income, and those with previous health conditions or COVID-19 symptoms.

Poor growth trajectory (GT) during early infancy may be a source of traumatic stress. The purpose of this study was to determine if differences exist in parent posttraumatic stress (PTS) between parents of infants with healthy versus poor GTs from hospital discharge to 4 months post discharge. Methods: This secondary analysis of a previously reported RCT (REACH telehealth trial NCT01941667) included parents of infants with CHD with stress measures at discharge and study end (n=136). Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale was used to measure PTS. Weights were converted to weight for age Z scores (WAZ) using World Health Organization standards. WAZ-GT classes were identified using latent class growth modeling. We used multivariate logistic regression modeling to examine associations between WAZ-GT and parental PTS over the study period, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS One-quarter of parents (n=37, 28%) demonstrated at least moderate PTS symptom severity at discharge and one-third at study end (n=40, 31%). We identified four distinct classes of infant WAZ-GT (Figure). Among the identified GTs, two were considered healthy growth patterns: “stable around WAZ=0” (n=51, 37.5%) and “maintaining WAZ &gt; 0” (n=12, 8.8%). Therefore, these two patterns were collapsed to serve as one reference group for the analysis. Two additional WAZ-GT classes were identified that reflected poor growth: “partially-recovered” (n=44, 32.4%) and “never-recovered” (n=29, 21.3%). Parents of infants in the ""never recovered"" GT were at greater risk (OR=4.58; CI=1.54-13.64) for experiencing at least moderate PTS symptom severity at end of study as well as over time from discharge to end of study (OR=3.91; CI=1.60-9.86). CONCLUSION Results offer new insights that parents of infants with poor GT are at increased risk for persistent PTS and may need additional screening and intervention.",0.624353789

Objectives Determine the number of latent parallel trajectories of mental health and employment earnings over two decades among a cohort of American youth entering the labor force, and estimate the association between baseline sociodemographic/health factors and latent trajectory class membership. Methods This study included 8,173 participants from the American National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, who were 13–17 years old in 1997. The survey occurred annually until 2011 then biennially until 2017. Mental health was measured eight times using the Mental Health Inventory-5 between 2000–2017. Employment earnings were measured annually between 1998–2017, where participants were 33–37 years old. Latent parallel trajectories were estimated using latent growth modeling. The association between baseline predictors and trajectory membership was explored using multinomial logistic regression. Results Four latent trajectory classes were identified: good mental health, high earnings (3% of sample, average 2017 earnings ˜$196,000 USD); good mental health, medium earnings (23%, average 2017 earnings ˜$78,100); good mental health, low earnings (50%, average 2017 earnings ˜$39,500); and poor mental, low earnings (24%, average 2017 earnings ˜$32,000). Multinomial models revealed participants who were younger, female, Black, Hispanic, who had lower socioeconomic status, and had used marijuana at baseline had higher odds of belonging to the poor mental health, low earnings class.

Aims We aimed to examine predictors of delayed PTSD in a community sample of survivors of a natural disaster. Method Norwegian survivors of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami ( n = 532) responded to a questionnaire at 6 and 24 months post-disaster. The questionnaire measured PTSD symptoms, recalled exposure and immediate stress responses to the disaster, recalled perceived life threat, personality dimensions, social support and other subsequent adverse life events. Results When dichotomising PTSD symptom scores, 331 participants had low and 194 had high PTSD scores (early-onset PTSD) at 6 months. Of those with initially low scores, 43 (13.0%) had high symptom scores (delayed PTSD) at 24 months. The delayed PTSD group had a lower degree of initially assessed threat and witness experiences of death or suffering, lower immediate stress response and higher degree of memory inflation of perceived threat than the early-onset PTSD group. Among those with low PTSD scores at 6 months, onset of delayed PTSD was associated with neuroticism and memory inflation of life threat, but not with the degree of initially assessed disaster exposure or reports of subsequent adverse life events. Conclusions Lack of association between trauma exposure and delayed onset of PTSD symptoms casts doubt on whether the traumatic event is actually the primary causative factor for delayed PTSD.

In this study, we utilize high-resolution aggregated location-based data to construct temporal human mobility networks in Houston in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey. We examine motif distribution, motif persistence, temporal stability, and motif attributes to reveal latent sub-structural mechanisms related to the resilience of human mobility networks during disaster-induced perturbations. The results show that urban flood impacts persist in human mobility networks at the sub-structure level for several weeks. The impact extent and recovery duration are heterogeneous across different network types. Also, while perturbation impacts persist at the sub-structure level, global topological network properties indicate that the network has recovered. The findings highlight the importance of examining the microstructures and their dynamic processes and attributes in understanding the resilience of temporal human mobility networks (and other temporal networks). The findings can also provide disaster managers, public officials, and transportation planners with insights to better evaluate impacts and monitor recovery in affected communities.",0.624011783

However, the developmental course of depression from childhood to early-adulthood has not been characterized in this high-risk group. Using longitudinal data from 337 young people who had a parent with a history of recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), we characterized trajectories of broadly defined depressive disorder using latent class growth analysis. We used clinical descriptions to further characterise trajectory classes. Two trajectory classes were identified: childhood-emerging (25 %) and adulthood-emerging (75 %). The childhood-emerging class showed high rates of depressive disorder from age 12.5, which persisted through the study period. The adulthood-emerging class showed low rates of depressive disorder until age 26. Individual factors (IQ and ADHD symptoms) and parent depression severity (comorbidity, persistence and impairment) differentiated the classes but there were no differences in family history score or polygenic scores associated with psychiatric disorder. Clinical descriptions indicated functional impairment in both classes, but more severe symptomatology and impairment in the childhood-emerging class. Attrition particularly affected participation in young adulthood. Factors associated with attrition were low family income, single parent household status and low parental education. The developmental course of depressive disorder in children of depressed parents is variable. When followed up to adult life, most individuals exhibited some functional impairment. An earlier age-of-onset was associated with a more persistent and impairing course of depression. Access to effective prevention strategies is particularly warranted for at-risk young people showing early-onsetting and persistent depressive symptoms.",0.623940913

Empirical studies should be carried out to determine the most appropriate definition for it. Therefore, the main aim of the current study was to investigate changes in adolescents’ resilience over two years and explore the links between resilience and different forms of child maltreatment. Methods The three-wave longitudinal study “Stress and resilience in adolescence” (STAR-A) sample was comprised of a general school-based sample of Lithuanian adolescents [baseline N = 1295, 56.7% females; M ( SD ) age = 14.24 (1.26)]. Resilience was measured using the 14-item Resilience Scale (RS-14), lifetime exposure to maltreatment was measured at wave 1 using a questionnaire developed by the Norwegian Center for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies (NKVTS), risk of psychopathology—using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). The changes in resilience scores over the period of two years were investigated using the latent growth modeling approach. Results The analyses revealed two classes of resilience—stable higher and stable lower. We found that experience of at least one form of abuse was significantly more prevalent in the lower resilience group in comparison to the higher resilience group. Also, adolescents with lower resilience had a higher probability of psychopathology. Conclusions This study provided meaningful insights into the stability of resilience over time in adolescence and its relation to various types of child maltreatment. Experiences of maltreatment, as well as risk for psychopathology, were linked to lower resilience in adolescence.",0.623740042

However, there is a lack of prospective longitudinal studies to further illuminate the temporal relationship between self-efficacy and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Thus, an important unresolved research question is whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms affect the level of self-efficacy or vice versa or whether they mutually influence each other. The present prospective longitudinal study investigated the reciprocal relationship between general self-efficacy (GSE) and posttraumatic stress symptoms in 143 physical assault victims. We used an autoregressive cross-lagged model across four assessment waves: within 4 months after the assault (T1) and then 3 months (T2), 12 months (T3) and 8 years (T4) after the first assessment. Stress symptoms at T1 and T2 predicted subsequent self-efficacy, while self-efficacy at T1 and T2 was not related to subsequent stress symptoms. These relationships were reversed after T3; higher levels of self-efficacy at T3 predicted lower levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms at T4, while posttraumatic tress symptoms at T3 did not predict self-efficacy at T4. In conclusion, posttraumatic stress symptoms may have a deteriorating effect on self-efficacy in the early phase after physical assault, whereas self-efficacy may promote recovery from posttraumatic stress symptoms over the long term.",0.622745341

Large patient datasets using routine outcome measures provides an opportunity to investigate treatments effect over time, as well as the relationship between outcomes and platform usage. Understanding these different trajectories of symptom change, as well as associated characteristics, may prove important for tailoring interventions or identifying patients who may not benefit from the intervention. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> The aim was to identify latent trajectories of symptom change during the iCBT treatment course for depression and anxiety and to investigate the patients’ characteristics and platform usage for each of these classes. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> This is a secondary analysis of data from a Randomized Controlled Trial designed to examine the effectiveness of guided-iCBT for anxiety and depression in the UK’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) program. The present work includes patients from the intervention group (N=256) and follows a longitudinal, retrospective design. As part of IAPT’s Routine Outcome Monitoring system, patients were prompted to complete PHQ-9 and GAD-7 after each supporter review during treatment period. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify underlying trajectories of symptom change across the treatment period for both, depression and anxiety. Differences in patient characteristics were then evaluated between these trajectory classes, and the presence of a time-varying relationship between platform usage and trajectory classes was investigated. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> Five-class models were identified as the optimal ones for both depression and anxiety as measured using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 respectively. Two thirds (70%) of the sample formed various trajectories of improvement classes that differed on baseline score, pace of symptom change, and final clinical outcome score. The remaining patients were in two smaller groups, one that saw minimal to no gains and another with consistently high scores across the treatment journey. No significant associations were found between different types of trajectories and baseline patient characteristics (age, sex, employment status, presence of long-term condition). While we did not find a time-varying relationship between usage and trajectory classes, we found an overall effect of time on platform usage suggesting that all participants used the intervention significantly more in the first four weeks. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> Most patients benefit from treatment and the various patterns of improvement have implications for how the iCBT intervention is delivered. Identifying predictors of non-response or early response might inform the level of support and monitoring required for different types of patients. Further work is necessary to explore differences between these trajectories to understand what works best for whom and to identify early-on those patients who are less likely to benefit from treatment. </sec>",0.622664637

Further, we assessed whether family functioning moderated this association. Methods Data of the first six waves of the TRAILS study (2001-2016; n = 2229) were used, a cohort followed from approximately age 11 to 23. We measured SLEs (death of a family member or other beloved one, delinquency, moving, victim of violence, parental divorce, and sexual harassment) at ages 14, 16 and 19. Family functioning was measured at all six time points using the Family Assessment Device (FAD), and mental health was measured through the Youth/Adult Self-Report at ages 11 and 23. Latent class growth analyses (LCGA) were used to examine longitudinal trajectories and associations. Results We identified three SLE trajectories (low, middle, high) throughout adolescence, and found no significant associations between these trajectories and changes in mental health from childhood to young adulthood. Family functioning and SLE trajectories were significantly associated, however, the association of SLE trajectories and changes in mental health was not modified by family functioning. Mental health problems at age 11 increased the likelihood of high SLE trajectories during adolescence, and of experiencing negative family functioning. Conclusion Experiencing SLEs throughout adolescence does not have a direct impact on changes in mental health from childhood to young adulthood, but early adolescence mental health problems increase the likelihood of experiencing SLEs.",0.622114333

The aim of this study was to explore the trajectories of post-traumatic stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms among exposed inhabitants during the first year following the earthquake, as well as predictors for symptomology. Methods: This was a longitudinal cohort study based on a sample that was randomly selected from the earthquake-stricken area ( n = 1301). Participants answered a questionnaire assessing demographic and disaster-related factors 2 months after the earthquake. In addition, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety were assessed 2, 4, 8 and 12 months post-disaster. Results: Two months after the earthquake, 5.2% of the participants reported PTSD symptoms, 6.7% depression and 6.4% anxiety symptoms. When comparing first and last time points only, we found a significant decrease in anxiety ( p = 0.05), particulary among females ( p = 0.05), those with a primary education ( p = 0.01), prior history of accidents/disasters ( p = 0.02) and those experiencing damage to their home ( p = 0.02). No significant trends were found when the development of other symptoms between the four time points was assessed. Conclusions: Findings indicate a reduction in anxiety symptoms between 2 and 12 months post-disaster, with PTSD and depression symptoms remaining fairly constant across time. No trends in symptomology were observed over time. The results highlight the need for continued monitoring of those affected by disasters and the identification of subgroups at risk in the aftermath of natural disasters.",0.621660875

Using the 12-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), symptom trajectories were estimated by latent class growth modeling over 3 measurement occasions (when their children were 10-11, 12-13, and 14-15 years). The moderating effect of youth chronic illness on the association between maternal depression and youth psychological functioning at 16-19 years was tested using multiple regression. Three measures of psychological functioning were assessed: anger regulation (Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory), self-concept (Self-Determination Questionnaire), and depressive symptoms (CES-D).Four trajectories (low, decreasing, increasing, high) of maternal depression were identified. The association of maternal depressive symptoms on youth psychological functioning was modified by chronic illness; less favorable trajectories of maternal depression had a more pronounced detrimental association on youths with chronic illness compared to controls.Youths with chronic illness are particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological exposure of maternal depressive symptoms during the transition to adulthood. Family-centered transition of care programs in the medical setting may be beneficial in reducing the association between symptoms of maternal depression and youth psychological functioning.",0.621630595

The objective of this study was to investigate the trajectories in pain severity and functional interference following non-catastrophic musculoskeletal (MSK) trauma in an international, mixed injury sample. MethodsA prospective longitudinal cohort (n= 241) was formed from patients identified within four weeks of trauma, from attendance at emergency or urgent care centres located in London, ON, Canada, or Chicago, IL, USA. Pain interference was measured via the Brief Pain Inventory (London cohort) or the Neck Disability Index (Chicago cohort). Pain severity was captured in both cohorts using the numeric pain rating scale. Growth mixture modeling and RM repeated measures ANOVA approaches identified distinct trajectories of recovery within pain interference and pain severity data. ResultsFor pain interference, the three trajectories were labeled accordingly: Class 1 = Rapid recovery (lowest intercept, full or near full recovery by 3 months, 32.0% of the sample); Class 2 = Delayed recovery (higher intercept, recovery by 12 months, 26.7% of the sample); Class 3 = Minimal or no recovery (higher intercept, persistently high interference scores at 12 months, 41.3% of the sample). For pain severity, the two trajectories were labeled: Class 1 = Rapid recovery (lower intercept, recovery by 3 months, 81.3% of the sample); and Class 2 = Minimal or no recovery (higher intercept, flat curve, 18.7% of the sample). The “Minimal or No Recovery” trajectory could be predicted by female sex and axial (vs. peripheral) region of trauma with 74.3% accuracy across the 3 classes for the % Interference outcome. For the Pain Severity outcome, only region (axial trauma, 81.3% accuracy) predicted the “Minimal or No Recovery” trajectory. ConclusionsThese results suggest that three meaningful recovery trajectories can be identified in an international, mixed-injury sample when pain interference is the outcome, and two recovery trajectories emerge when pain severity is the outcome. Females in the sample or people who suffered axial injuries (head, neck, or low back) were more likely to be classed in poor outcome trajectories.

This study’s goal was to investigate psychological distress trajectories starting from 1 year before to 4 years after the onset of a physical CHC. The specific aims were to identify the number and shape of longitudinal psychological distress trajectories and to test health-related, psychological, social, and demographic factors predicting these trajectories. Method: Two samples were drawn from the Swiss Household Panel data set: a CHC sample (n = 361) and a 1-to-1 matched comparison sample of healthy individuals. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify psychological distress trajectories over 6 years. Factors predicting trajectories were then tested using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Four psychological distress trajectories were identified in the CHC sample: resilience (53.9%), chronic (22.2%), delayed (15.0%), and recovery (8.9%). In the comparison sample, two trajectories were identified: low psychological distress (90%) and elevated psychological distress (10%). Protective factors associated with resilient trajectory membership in the CHC sample were higher emotional stability, higher relationship satisfaction, and male gender. Conclusion: Individuals living with a CHC had an increased risk of vulnerability compared with a sample of healthy individuals. This advocates awareness of mental health issues following the onset of a CHC. In this regard, biopsychosocial factors (gender, emotional stability, and relationship satisfaction) offer prevention and intervention opportunities for more vulnerable individuals.",0.621564625

Thus, identifying predictors that shape the course of post-discharge NSSI may provide insights into ways to improve clinical outcomes. Accordingly, we used machine learning to identify the strongest predictors of NSSI trajectories drawn from a comprehensive clinical assessment. Method: The study included adolescents (N=612; females n=435; 71.1%) aged 13-19-years-old (M=15.6, SD=1.4) receiving treatment from a psychiatric inpatient service. Youth were administered clinical interviews and symptom questionnaires at treatment initiation (baseline) and before termination. NSSI frequency was assessed at one-, three-, and six-month follow-ups. Latent class growth analyses were used to group adolescents based on their pattern of NSSI engagement across follow-ups. Results: Three classes were identified, reflecting: Low Stable (n=83), Moderate Fluctuating (n=260), and High Persistent (n=269). Important predictors of the High Persistent class in our regularized regression models (LASSO) included baseline psychiatric symptoms and comorbidity, past-week suicidal ideation (SI) severity, lifetime average and worst-point SI intensity, and NSSI in the past 30 days (bs=0.75-2.33). Only worst-point lifetime suicide ideation intensity was identified as a predictor of the Low Stable class (b=-8.82); no predictors of Moderate Fluctuating class were identified. Conclusion: This study identified a set of intake clinical variables that indicate which adolescents may experience persistent NSSI post-discharge. Accordingly, this may help identify the youth that may benefit from additional monitoring and support post-hospitalization.",0.62134435

Patient-reported outcomes were investigated at the time of the patient's outpatient visit (T1), 1 month after the visit (T2), 3 months after the visit (T3), and 6 months after the visit (T4). Latent class growth modeling was used to determine the number and shape of trajectories, and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used to explore influence factors of each class.COPD patients' reported outcome trajectories were classified into 3 categories: health low-level group (14.80%), health risk group (54.70%), and good health group (30.50%). Logistic regression analysis showed that gender, BMI, smoking history, number of comorbidities, whether it was their first visit, and lung function classification were influential factors in patients' reported outcome trajectories (P<0.05). Female, obese, had a history of smoking, number of comorbid diseases >3, first diagnosis, and lung function class IV had a higher probability of entering the healthy low-level group.COPD patients have poor self-reported health levels during the first 6 months after the outpatient visit, and there is group heterogeneity in patient-reported outcome trajectories; medical staff should give patients specific nursing interventions based on their current development of COPD, self-reported changes, and other relevant influencing factors.",0.621185522

However, research on R/S growth following disasters has over-relied on retrospective self-reports of growth. We therefore examined longitudinal change in religiousness/spirituality following two disasters.Religious survivors of Hurricanes Harvey (Study 1) and Irma (Study 2) completed measures of perceived R/S PTG, general religiousness/spirituality (""current standing""-R/S PTG), and subfacets of religiousness/spirituality (spiritual fortitude, religious motivations, and benevolent theodicies).

In Study 2, participants responded within 5-days predisaster and at 1-month (N = 1,144) and 6-months postdisaster (N = 684).In both studies, perceived R/S PTG was weakly related to longitudinal increases in general religiousness/spirituality and in most of its subfacets, but reliable growth in any R/S outcome was rare. Additionally, Study 2 revealed evidence that actual change in psychological well-being is associated with actual (but not perceived) R/S PTG, but disaster survivors tend to exhibit declines in their religiousness/spirituality, spiritual fortitude, and religious motivations.Results suggest disaster survivors are only modestly accurate in perceiving how much positive R/S change they experience following a disaster.

Over 175 million youth are affected by disasters each year with increased vulnerability that often receives insufficient attention. The impact of displacement, loss of homes, and separation from families and community has a significant effect on children including risk of interrupting their developmental trajectory. Response and recovery for children after catastrophic events depends on degree of exposure, previous trauma history, age, gender, and, importantly, support by family, school, and community. In disaster response, more attention is given to addressing problems than supporting components leading to increased self-efficacy and resilience. This article presents a dynamic understanding of ways to support resilience in children and adolescents following disasters by considering not only the capacity for positive adaptation to threats, but also ways to strengthen social infrastructure at the community level. A program integrating mental health consultation and services into schools following disasters is described to support resilience by building social capital. Trajectories of posttraumatic stress symptoms in children following disasters will be presented that are consistent with resilience theory.

Recent research indicates that evacuation is stressful for families and is associated with psychological distress. Yet, little is known about the potential impact of evacuation stressors on child health. After Hurricane Irma, which led to a mass evacuation in Florida, we examined whether evacuation stressors and hurricane exposure were uniquely associated with youth somatic complaints, and whether youth psychological distress (i.e., symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression) served as a potential mediating pathway between evacuation stressors, hurricane experiences, and somatic complaints. Method Three months after Irma, 226 mothers of youth aged 7–17 years ( N =226; M age = 9.76 years; 52% boys; 31% Hispanic) living in the five southernmost Florida counties reported on evacuation stressors, hurricane-related life threat and loss/disruption, and their child’s psychological distress and somatic complaints using standardized measures. Results Structural equation modeling revealed a good model fit (χ 2 = 32.24, p = 0.003, CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.08, SRMR = 0.04). Even controlling for life-threatening hurricane experiences ( β = 0.26) and hurricane loss and disruption ( β = 0.26), greater evacuation stressors were associated with greater symptoms of youth psychological distress ( β = 0.34; p ’s &amp;lt; 0.001), and greater psychological distress was associated with more somatic complaints ( β = 0.67; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Indirect effects revealed that evacuation stressors ( p &amp;lt; 0.001), actual life-threatening events ( p &amp;lt; 0.01), and loss and disruption ( p &amp;lt; 0.01) were all uniquely and indirectly associated with youths’ somatic complaints via youth psychological distress. Discussion Findings suggest that even coping with the threat of a disaster may be sufficient to prompt psychological and physical health symptoms in youth. Due in part to climate change, threats of disaster occur much more often than actual disaster exposure, especially for areas that are prone to hurricanes or wildfires. Preparing youth and families residing in vulnerable areas for potential disaster evacuation or sheltering-in-place appears critical. Encouraging families to develop Disaster Plans and teaching stress management skills may reduce both youth distress and somatic health problems.",0.619734543

Based on the environmental docility hypothesis and research regarding gender effects on functional limitations and disaster, our analyses examined the effects of peri-traumatic stress experienced during Hurricane Sandy using longitudinal data from 5688 people aged 50 and older collected over six waves (2006-2019).We found that functional limitations follow three trajectories, with people in each group having a significant linear increase over time and all but the highest functioning people also having a significant quadratic effect, indicating that the linear increase peaked post-Hurricane and then slowed in later waves.Consistent with the environmental docility hypothesis, peri-traumatic stress had its greatest impact on people with more functional limitations before the hurricane. Men experiencing peri-traumatic stress during Hurricane Sandy were more likely to experience an increase in functional limitations than women.

This paper reports the integration of quantitative and qualitative findings from a sequential explanatory mixed methods study examining young people aged 16-24 years’ experience and trajectory of traumatic physical injury in the initial six months. The aim of integration was to address the question: In what ways are injured young peoples’ experiences and self-management during the initial six months of the injury trajectory impacted by their injury, family support, and provision of healthcare? Methods Key findings from epidemiological datasets on young person injuries from hospital and coronial databases (Phase 1) were combined with key findings from qualitative interviews with 12 injured young people and 10 family members (Phase 2). Results The integration of findings from Phase 1 and Phase 2 resulted in three new findings; [1] (Alfred Health, 2014). A young person’s perception of the severity of their injury, as well as the amount of time spent in hospital, impacts substantially on the way in which they experience injury, and this is managed differently between genders; [2] (Newnam et al., 2014). Admission to an Intensive care unit, including the intensity and duration of care, is the primary influence on how a family will provide support to the young person in the inpatient period; and [3] (Lyons et al., 2010). Young people's perception and understanding of their recovery from injury is in contrast with how healthcare systems are structured to provide rehabilitation and recovery care. Conclusion The injury trajectory and recovery process of young people in the six months following injury have been have conceptualised. These trajectories of recovery can inform the development of anticipatory guidance frameworks for clinicians and guide the provision of and planning for clinical services for injured young people.",0.61950622

We aimed to determine and characterize trajectories of depressive symptoms among adults with bipolar disorder during 6 months of systematic treatment. Methods The pragmatic clinical trial, Bipolar Clinical Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness (CHOICE), randomized 482 outpatients with bipolar disorder to lithium or quetiapine. Depressive symptoms were rated at up to 9 visits using the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Growth mixture modeling was utilized to identify trajectories and multinomial regression analysis estimated associations with potential predictors. Results Four distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified. The responding class (60.3%) with a rapid reduction and subsequent low level; the partial‐responding class (18.4%) with an initial reduction followed by an increase during the remaining weeks; the fluctuating class (11.6%) with a fluctuation in depressive symptoms; and the non‐responding class (9.7%) with sustained moderate‐severe depressive symptoms. Bipolar type I predicted membership of the non‐responding class and randomization to quetiapine predicted membership of either the responding or the non‐responding class. Conclusion Approximately 30% experienced a partial or fluctuating course, and almost 10% had a chronic course with moderate‐severe depression during 6 months. Patients diagnosed with bipolar type 1 had higher risk of being categorized into a class with a worse outcome. While no differences in average overall outcomes occurred between the lithium and quetiapine groups, trajectory analysis revealed that the lithium group had more variable courses.",0.619366353

We also aimed to assess the number and portion of women classified into each distinct trajectory and the sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors associated with these trajectories. The international sample included 699 participants who were recruited soon after being diagnosed with breast cancer as part of the BOUNCE Project. QoL was assessed at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and we used Latent Class Growth Analysis to identify trajectory subgroups. Sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors at baseline were used to predict latent class membership. Four distinct QoL trajectories were identified in the first 12 months after a breast cancer diagnosis: medium and stable (26% of participants); medium and improving (47%); high and improving (18%); and low and stable (9%). Thus, most women experienced improvements in QoL during the first year post-diagnosis. However, approximately one-third of women experienced consistently low-to-medium QoL. Cancer stage was the only variable which was related to the QoL trajectory in the multivariate analysis. Early interventions which specifically target women who are at risk of ongoing low QoL are needed.",0.618957359

We explored whether the discrepancy between SH and OH (operationalised as 'health asymmetry' with four categories: 'health optimistic', 'health pessimistic' and 'good health realistic' and 'poor health realistic') may also relate to depressive symptomatology 1) cross-sectionally, and 2) longitudinally, among older European adults.Adults (n = 26,520), aged 50+, from 11 European countries, were assessed over six waves of data collection (2006-2020) in the SHARE study. A hierarchical multi-level growth curve model explored whether health asymmetry was associated with depressive symptomology at baseline, and with depressive symptom trajectories across time, accounting for country of origin.At baseline, 11.8% of older adults were classified as health pessimistic, with 15.5% being health optimistic, 42.9% being poor health realistic and 29.8% being good health realistic. A positive linear trend in depressive symptomatology was noted across 14 years of SHARE data (β = 0.11, p < .001). Health pessimists displayed higher levels of depressive symptoms than both health realistic groups and health optimists. However, health pessimists experienced a less steep increase in depressive symptoms across time (β = -0.10, p < .001), relative to good health realists.Health pessimists experience elevated levels of depressive symptoms, but show less growth in depressive symptomatology than expected. Further research is required to understand the underlying causes of the varying depressive symptom trajectories among these groups.",0.618955959

Methods: This population-based longitudinal prospective cohort study included 2,111 families drawn from the Chinese Family Panel Study (CFPS) with biannual assessments from 2010 to 2018. Group-based multi-trajectory modeling was used to identify depression trajectories of children, fathers, and mothers. Results: Six distinct profiles of depression symptoms were identified: 1) low stable among all family members (35.6%); (2) low increasing in child and moderate stable in parents (13.1%); (3) low increasing in child, father resurging, and mother high increasing (3.2%); (4) low/moderate stable in child and father, and moderate increasing in mother (26.8%); (5) low/moderate stable in child and mother, and moderate increasing in father (12.5%); (6) moderate/high symptoms in all family members (8.8%). Conclusions: Based upon multi-trajectory findings of family depression profiles, when adolescents are at risk for depression, there is likely at least one parent concurrently at risk for depression, but not vice versa. Families with social disadvantages and children of delayed developmental milestones are at elevated risk for depression. Even when children are at low risk for depression, depression in parents can spill over to impact other psychosocial and health outcomes. These findings suggest examining depression and its associating psychosocial factors could help identify trajectories of varying onset and continuity, which can inform early prevention and intervention from a family system perspective.",0.61887897

The majority of human mobility network resilience characterizations, however, focus mainly on macroscopic network properties; little is known about variation in measured resilience characteristics (i.e., the extent of impact and recovery duration) across macroscopic, substructure (motif), and microscopic mobility scales. To address this gap, in this study, we examine the human mobility network in eight parishes in Louisiana (USA) impacted by the 2021 Hurricane Ida. We constructed human mobility networks using location-based data and examined three sets of measures: (1) macroscopic measures, such as network density, giant component size, and modularity; (2) substructure measures, such as motif distribution; and (3) microscopic mobility measures, such as the radius of gyration and average travel distance. To determine the extent of impact and duration of recovery, for each measure, we established the baseline values and examined the fluctuation of measures during the perturbation caused by Hurricane Ida. The results reveal the variation of impact extent and recovery duration obtained from different sets of measures at different scales. Macroscopic measures, such as giant components, tend to recover more quickly than substructure and microscopic measures. In fact, microscopic measures tend to recover more slowly than measures in other scales. These findings suggest that resilience characteristics in human mobility networks are scale-variant, and thus, a single measure at a particular scale may not be representative of the perturbation impacts and recovery duration in the network as a whole. These results spotlight the need to use measures at different scales to properly characterize resilience in human mobility networks.",0.618838926

Typologies of PTSD symptom presentation were examined at one month pre-deployment and again one, five, and eight months post-deployment.Heterogeneity in PTSD symptom presentation was evident at each assessment point, and the degree of symptom heterogeneity (i.e., the number of classes identified) differed by time point. Symptom patterns stabilized over time from notable symptom fluctuations during the early post-deployment period to high, medium, and low symptom severity by eight months post-deployment. Hypervigilance and exaggerated startle were frequently endorsed by participants in the initial month post-deployment. Flashbacks, amnesia, and foreshortened future were infrequently endorsed. Greater combat exposure, lifespan trauma, and avoidant coping generally predicted worse outcomes.Data were self-report and may have limited generalizability due to our lack of women and inclusion of only combat Marines. Attrition and re-ranging of data resulted in significant missing data and affected the representativeness of the sample.Symptom-level variability is highest in the month following deployment and then stabilizes over time. Should post-deployment assessments occur too soon, they may capture common and transient early post-deployment reactions, particularly anxious arousal.",0.618626605

Emerging research indicates that many children have longer-term problems with pain. However, limited data exist on the course of pain over time and the impact of pain recovery on long-term health outcomes. We sought to prospectively characterize children's postsurgical pain trajectories using repeated assessments over 12 months. In addition, we identified presurgical child and parent psychological risk factors associated with persistent pain and examined relationships between pain trajectories and long-term health outcomes. Sixty children aged 10 to 18 years undergoing major surgery and their parent/guardian were enrolled. Participants completed assessments at 5 time points: presurgery, inhospital, 2 weeks, 4 months, and 1 year postsurgery. Child and parent pain catastrophizing was assessed during the week before surgery. Children completed daily monitoring with an electronic pain diary and reported on pain characteristics, health-related quality of life, and activity limitations. Group-based longitudinal modeling revealed 2 distinct trajectories of postsurgical pain: early recovery (n = 49, 82%) and late recovery (n = 11, 18%). In a logistic regression model controlling for age and sex, parental pain catastrophizing before surgery significantly predicted membership in the late recovery group (odds ratio = 1.11, P = 0.03), whereas child catastrophizing and baseline pain did not (Ps < 0.05). In a multivariate regression controlling for age and sex, late pain recovery was significantly associated with poorer health-related quality of life (β = −10.7, P = 0.02) and greater activity limitations (β = 3.6, P = 0.04) at 1 year. Our findings suggest that preoperative interventions that modify parent behaviors and cognitions might be beneficial in this population. Trajectory analysis revealed a subgroup of children with persistent pain after surgery, predicted by parental pain catastrophizing and associated with poorer health outcomes at 12 months.",0.618484598

Data from three waves of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (1999–2007) (NSCAW; National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect, 2002) were analyzed to investigate the change trajectories of both externalizing and PTS symptomatology among children with a substantiated report of child maltreatment by Child Protective Services (CPS) between October 1999 and December 2000. This study uses data collected at three time points: baseline and approximately 18 (Wave 3) and 36 (Wave 4) months post-baseline. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scale measured externalizing symptoms and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) provided the measure of current trauma-related symptoms or distress. Analyses were conducted using a parallel process growth curve model with a sample of n = 280 maltreated youth between the ages of 8 and 15 following home removal. Findings revealed that initial levels of externalizing and PTS symptomatology were both significantly and positively related and co-develop over time. Externalizing symptom severity remained in the borderline range during the first two years in out-of-home care. Both direct and indirect forms of interpersonal violence exposure were associated with initial level of externalizing symptom and PTS symptom severity, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest an underlying process that links early violence exposure to the co-development and cumulative impact of PTS on externalizing behavior above and beyond experiences of maltreatment. We conclude by discussing the key points of intervention that result from a more nuanced understanding of the longitudinal relationship between PTS and externalizing symptoms and the effect of complex trauma on growth in these symptoms over time.",0.617895387
https://openalex.org/W2229480009,10.1111/jcpp.12518,"Latent class profiles of depressive symptoms from early to middle childhood: predictors, outcomes, and gender effects","Background There has been little available data to inform the predictors and outcomes of latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms beginning during preschool and continuing throughout school age. Further, the extant literature in this domain has been limited by the use of parent report checklists of nonspecific ‘internalizing’ psychopathology rather than diagnostic interviews for depression. Methods To address these gaps in the literature, this study applied growth mixture modeling to depressive symptom severity endorsed by children and/or their caregivers ( N = 348) during a structured clinical interview in a 10‐year longitudinal dataset spanning from preschool into late school age. Results Three distinct trajectories of depressive symptom severity were found in boys and girls. For boys, but not girls, the high depression severity latent class increased in depressive symptoms from preschool through school age, followed by a decline in depressive symptom severity during later school age. For girls, the high depression severity latent class remained stable across time. Early childhood social adversity, familial history of affective disorder, preschool‐onset ODD / CD , and school age functional impairment differentiated high‐risk trajectory classes among both boys and girls. Conclusions Extending the literature on trajectories of depressive symptoms to the preschool period, these findings incorporate structured clinical interviews of depressive symptom severity and indicate gender differences as well as psychosocial predictors and functional outcomes among children in high severity latent classes. The findings from this study suggest that increased attention to screening for depressive symptoms in early childhood is of significant public health importance.",0.617654233

Characterizing the longitudinal course of depressive symptoms over the first year after birth and identifying variables that predict distinct symptom trajectories will expedite efficient mental health treatment planning. The purpose was to determine 12-month trajectories of postpartum depressive symptoms, identify characteristics that predict the trajectories, and provide a computational algorithm that predicts trajectory membership.A prospective cohort of women delivering at an academic medical center (2006-2011) was recruited from an urban women's hospital in Pittsburgh, PA. Women with a postpartum depressive disorder (n = 507) participated and completed symptom severity assessments at 4-8 weeks (intake), 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Women were predominantly Caucasian (71.8%), married (53.3%), and college educated (38.7%). Clinician interviews of depressive symptom severity, medical and psychiatric history, assessment of function, obstetric experience, and infant status were conducted.Analyses resulted in identification of three distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms: (1) gradual remission (50.4%), (2) partial improvement (41.8%), and (3) chronic severe (7.8%). Key predictive characteristics of the chronic severe versus gradual remission and partial improvement trajectories included parity, education, and baseline global functioning and depression severity. We were able to predict trajectory membership with 72.8% accuracy from these characteristics.Four maternal characteristics predicted membership in the chronic severe versus gradual remission and partial improvement trajectories with 72.8% accuracy.

In an observational multicenter study, weekly measurements of symptom severity were performed during inpatient treatment and 6 months after discharge. The symptom severity was measured using the 18-item scale of the Hamburg Modules for the Assessment of Psychosocial Health. The sample included 576 inpatients (mean age: 43.9 years; 77.6% female; main diagnoses: depressive (57.2%), adjustment (15.8%), anxiety (7.4%), and eating disorders (7.2%); mean treatment duration: 42.0 days). With empirically and clinically informed growth mixture models four subgroups of symptom change were revealed: gradual response (71%), early response (9%), delayed response (5%), and nonresponse (11%). Particularly low educational level, non-employment and chronic disorders were associated with unfavorable symptom courses (non- and delayed response). Long-term outcomes differed systematically across subgroups (p<0.001; η2=0.165). The patients who responded early presented the highest rates of clinically significant improvement (43.9%) from admission to follow-up. Nearly all of these patients (92.7%) showed reliable improvement. Due to the high association of symptom change trajectories with long-term outcomes, results may contribute to interventions that are tailored to the needs of patients and may foster longer lasting therapeutic effectiveness.",0.617110916

This study examined latent trajectories of change in the alliance and their relationship to depression treatment outcomes.Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.A sample of N = 79 depressed participants completed standardized alliance (WAI-SF) and depression symptom measures (PHQ-9) every session during an 8-session CAT intervention. Growth mixture modelling was applied to model alliance trajectories and to classify cases into different latent classes. Associations between alliance class and post-treatment PHQ-9 scores were examined using hierarchical linear regression, controlling for confounders.There were two classes of alliance trajectories. The majority class (91%) displayed stable alliance trajectories, whilst a minority class (9%) had initially poor alliance ratings that significantly improved during treatment. Baseline severity and early change in depression symptoms significantly predicted treatment outcomes, but early alliance and longitudinal alliance change did not.Alliance trajectories did not significantly predict depression treatment outcomes after controlling for initial symptom severity and early change. An important limitation concerns the small sample size, so future replication in larger samples is necessary.",0.616671802

In this current study, we adopted the developmental view of resilience. We combined the person-focused (classification and trajectory) and variable-focused (regression) methods to analyze the longitudinal data of 744 students from the TDCYP 2011-2017. We conducted item response theory (IRT) models and a latent class growth modeling framework. First, we measured each person’s latent trait level by IRT and simultaneously identified the classes by positive outcome (academic self-concept) and risk factors. Eventually, to explain the class membership and growth factors by adding covariates. The finding of this study as follows, (1) the four-class model was selected, and they are the competent group (17%), the resilient group (34%), the vulnerable group (31%), and the maladaptive group (18%). (2) The developmental hypothesis of academic resilience was not confirmed because the slope factors of academic self-concept and two groups of risk factors showed no significance. (3) Moreover, we found gender, mental health (illness), and teacher support play critical roles in this study, and they could explain the growth trends and even the membership classifying. The family support and poverty factors were lack of influence might due to the data properties. Importantly, this study can advise educators that it is worth further studying and practicing that school-based context on how to support a student, especially the socioeconomically disadvantaged.

Latent group trajectory methods (latent growth mixture models [LGMM] or latent class growth analysis [LCGA]) can be used to classify similar individual trajectories in a priori non-observed groups (latent groups), sharing common characteristics. Although increasingly used in the field of T2D epidemiology, many questions remain regarding the utilization of these methods. Objective: To review the literature of longitudinal studies using latent group trajectory methods among individuals with T2D. Methods: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science were searched through August 25 th , 2021. Data were collected on the type of method used (LGMM or LGCA), characteristics of studies and quality of reporting using the GRoLTS-Checklist. Results: From the 4,694 citations screened, a total of 38 studies were included. The studies were published between 2010 and 2021. Total follow-ups ranged from 8 weeks to 11 years, with 95% (36 out of 38) studies with a follow-up of 1 year of more. The characteristics of studies are presented in Table 1. Regarding the quality of reporting, trajectory groups were adequately presented, however many studies failed to report important decisions made for the trajectory group identification. Many studies considered trajectory groups as exposures to a subsequent outcome. Yet, issues in relation with selection bias, immortal bias and residual confounding were suspected and poorly addressed. Conclusions: Although LCGA were preferred, the context of utilization, data sources and research questions were diverse and unrelated to the type of method used. We recommend authors to clearly report the decisions made in trajectory groups identification.",0.61658623

Method In a sample of 402 outpatients ( M age = 38.27, 64.9% women), outcome scores ( OQ ‐45) on three time points (sessions 1, 3, and 5) were analysed by means of L atent C lass G rowth C urve A nalysis. A multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate whether patient's age, gender, initial distress ( OQ ‐45), and personality traits ( D imensional A ssessment of P ersonality P athology– S hort F orm) predicted trajectory class membership. A repeated‐measures ANOVA examined whether differences in trajectory classes moderated the alliance quality ( W orking A lliance I nventory– S hort version) over time. Results Four trajectory classes were identified: High distress–no change; moderate/high distress–small improvement, low distress–moderate improvement, and moderate/low distress–strong improvement. Gender, initial distress, and emotion dysregulation significantly predicted patients’ trajectory class membership. The T ask/ G oal alliance component increased linearly over time, whereas the B ond component followed a reversed U ‐shaped pattern. The alliance was not moderated by trajectory class membership. Conclusions Four clinically relevant subgroups could be identified on the basis of the early symptom change trajectories. Gender, initial psychological distress, and emotion dysregulation predicted patient's trajectory class membership. Trajectory class membership did not influence the development of the early working alliance. Practitioner points As early change in highly distressed patients (Axis I and II ) is not characterized by significant symptom change, clinicians should support and facilitate emotion regulation and social skills. Investing in a strong alliance is recommended, although it does not differentiate early responders from non‐responders.",0.616543578

A sample of 153 children, selected for temperamental reactivity to novelty, was followed from infancy through early childhood. At 9 months, infant avoidance of fear-eliciting stimuli in the laboratory and maternal sensitivity at home were assessed. At 36 months, maternal gentle discipline was assessed at home. Children were repeatedly observed in the lab with an unfamiliar peer across early childhood. A latent class growth analysis yielded three longitudinal risk trajectories of social reticence behavior: a high-stable trajectory, a high-decreasing trajectory, and a low-increasing trajectory. For infants displaying greater avoidance, 9-month maternal sensitivity and 36-month maternal gentle discipline were both positively associated with membership in the high-stable social reticence trajectory, compared to the high-decreasing social reticence trajectory. For infants displaying lower avoidance, maternal sensitivity was positively associated with membership in the high-decreasing social reticence trajectory, compared to the low-increasing trajectory. Maternal sensitivity was positively associated with the high-stable social reticence trajectory when maternal gentle discipline was lower. These results illustrate the complex interplay of infant and maternal behavior in early childhood trajectories at risk for emerging psychopathology.",0.616494255

Even negative changes in survivors’ life view, known as posttraumatic depreciation (PTD), have been identified as an additional aspect in the personal recovery processes.Objective: To examine how the type of exposure experienced by survivors of a natural disaster, the 2004 Southeast Asia tsunami, influenced self-reported PTG and PTD six years later (T2). Additionally, the study examined the relations between psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) 14 months after the disaster (T1), to PTG and PTD, respectively at T2. Finally, the study examined whether psychological distress and PTSS (T1) could have a mediating effect on PTG and PTD at T2.Method: The participants were 848 tsunami survivors living in Stockholm, Sweden who responded to a questionnaire at 14 months (T1) and six years (T2) after the tsunami. The material was analysed using linear regression and pathway analysis. PTG and PTD were measured on separate scales.Results: The type of exposure was significant related to both PTG and PTD six years later (T2). Those experiencing a combination of various types of exposure (including threat to life and bereavement) reported higher scores for both PTG and PTD. There were significant positive correlations between PTSS at T1 and PTG /PTD at T2, and somewhat lower correlations between psychological distress at T1 and PTG/PTD at T2. Both PTSS and psychological distress at T1 were significant mediating variables for both PTG and PTD at T2.Conclusions: Studying survivors’ various types of exposure and subsequent changed view of life – both PTG and PTD – resulted in a broadened understanding of the complexity of reactions and the recovery process among survivors.",0.616424152

Data from the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study, a longitudinal, multisite, observational study, were uploaded to the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Repository (FITBIR) database. Participants were enrolled at 1 of 18 participating level I trauma centers and enrolled within 24 hours of TBI injury. Additional data were obtained directly from the TRACK-TBI investigators that will be uploaded to FITBIR in the future. Data were collected from February 26, 2014, to August 8, 2018, and analyzed from July 1, 2020, to November 15, 2021.Traumatic brain injury.Insomnia Severity Index assessed serially at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months thereafter.The final sample included 2022 participants (1377 [68.1%] men; mean [SD] age, 40.1 [17.2] years) from the FITBIR database and the TRACK-TBI study. The data were best fit by a 5-class LCMM. Of these participants, 1245 (61.6%) reported persistent mild insomnia symptoms (class 1); 627 (31.0%) initially reported mild insomnia symptoms that resolved over time (class 2); 91 (4.5%) reported persistent severe insomnia symptoms (class 3); 44 (2.2%) initially reported severe insomnia symptoms that resolved by 12 months (class 4); and 15 (0.7%) initially reported no insomnia symptoms but had severe symptoms by 12 months (class 5). In a multinomial logistic regression model, several factors significantly associated with insomnia trajectory class membership were identified, including female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.65 [95% CI, 1.02-2.66]), Black race (OR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.39-4.01]), history of psychiatric illness (OR, 2.21 [95% CI, 1.35-3.60]), and findings consistent with intracranial injury on computed tomography (OR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.20-0.65]) when comparing class 3 with class 1.These results suggest important heterogeneity in the course of insomnia after TBI in adults. More work is needed to identify outcomes associated with these insomnia trajectory class subgroups and to identify optimal subgroup-specific treatment approaches.",0.616312368

Our objective is to characterize the factors associated with post-traumatic growth in parents after a child's pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission.A cross-sectional survey study examining post-traumatic growth and select independent variables in parents 1 year after a child's ≥72 h PICU admission for an acute illness or injury. The study was completed in parents of children discharge alive from a tertiary care PICU from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017. A mixed-effects linear regression model was built to evaluate the association of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, resiliency, family function, and child function with post-traumatic growth.Eighty-two parents of 52 children discharged alive in 2017 completed the survey. Fifty-two percent were ≥35 years and 64.3% were mothers. Median age of their children was 2.8 years (IQR 0.5-11.3) with a median hospital stay of 12 Days (IQR 6-20). Moderate-to-high levels of post-traumatic growth occurred in 67.1% of parents. Increased hospital length of stay (β Coeff 0.85; p = 0.004, 95% CI 0.27, 1.43) and parent post-traumatic stress symptoms (β Coeff 1.04; p = 0.006, 95% CI 0.29, 1.78) were associated with increased post-traumatic growth, and increased parent depression symptoms (β Coeff -1.96; p = 0.015; 95% CI -3.54, -0.38) with decreased post-traumatic growth.Longer child hospital stays and increased parent post-traumatic stress symptoms were associated with increased post-traumatic growth, while increased depression was associated with less post-traumatic growth. The impact of future PICU parent psychosocial interventions on parents may be best assessed using a dual outcome focused on both reducing negative mental health symptoms while concurrently promoting skills to facilitate parent adaptation and post-traumatic growth.",0.616275213

Higher initial anxiety symptoms were significantly associated with the no change and strong response subgroups; symptom-related disability in daily routine with no changes. Patients with a strong response had the highest proportion of reliable improvement at termination and at six-month-follow-up.Our results indicate that, instead of one common change pattern, patients with PSS respond differently to treatment. Due to the high association of symptom curves with long-term outcome, the identification and prediction of an individual's trajectory could provide important information for clinicians to identify non-responding patients that are at risk for failure. Selecting personalized treatment interventions could increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01908855..",0.615863311

In addition, we aimed to study how shift work and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) in midlife predict assignment to MLs trajectories separately for those retired on statutory pensions (SPs) and on disability pensions (DPs). Methods Subjects who responded MLs questionnaires (1985–2009, N = 3048) in Finnish Longitudinal Study on Aging Municipal Employees were included in this prospective cohort study. LTPA and shift work were measured during baseline. International Classification of Functioning was used to code MLs. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify the trajectories of MLs. Odds ratio (OR) and their 95% Confidence interval (CI) were assessed by using multinomial logistic regression. Results We identified four trajectories of MLs, namely low persistent, low increasing, high decreasing and high persistent. Among the SP recipients, shift work with night shifts was associated with an increased risk (adjusted OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.03–2.14) of belonging to the high persistent MLs trajectory. The inactive LTPA (SP: OR 5.99, 95% CI 3.39–10.58, DP: OR 6.81, 95% CI 2.52–18.43) was similarly associated with high persistent MLs trajectory. Conclusion Nearly two-thirds of the people retired due to disability belonged to high MLs trajectory. High persistent MLs trajectory was associated with physical inactivity in midlife among those retired on SP and on DP. Shift work with night shift predicted high persistent MLs in SP strata. Active involvement in LTPA during midlife could be beneficial to spend MLs free later life.",0.615766011

As a case study, the comparison of the methods is conducted for the development of loneliness from middle childhood to young adulthood. The aim is to explore how two nonparametric longitudinal cluster methods compare with a model‐based latent class mixture model approach. Methods The trajectories of loneliness of 130 young people between 9 and 21 years of age, were analyzed to find a set clusters within these trajectories. The data for this study were obtained from the Nijmegen Longitudinal Study on Infant and Child Development (The Netherlands). Loneliness was measured at four waves at the age of 9, 13, 16, and 21 years. The nonparametric methods are in the R‐packages kml and traj, and the model‐based in the lcmm package. Results All methods indicated that the optimal number of clusters to describe the heterogeneity across the trajectories was three. The kml and lcmm methods showed the most similarity in shape of all clusters and fitted the data relatively well, while the traj method yielded somewhat different shapes and didn't fit the data well. Conclusions All three methods corroborate the literature in this field by finding that the largest portion of subjects experience stable and low levels of loneliness. However, the clustering methods also reveal that there is a portion of subjects that experience changes in loneliness during adolescence. By comparing the results of nonparametric clustering methods to the latent class mixture model, this study equips researchers with an example of how to implement these models and thereby contributes to the literature on longitudinal clustering in the social sciences. Altogether the analyses show that it might be useful to investigate different algorithms to identify the most robust solution.",0.615696467

Background Grieving is a dynamic/individualised process. In studies treating depressive‐symptom trajectories as heterogeneous, different criteria were used to identify distinct trajectories, resulting in inconsistent findings. Design A systematic review of research guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses criteria. Methods Five databases were systematically searched since each one's launch through June 2015. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the qualsyst evaluation tool. Distinct depressive‐symptom trajectories were narratively synthesised based on depressive‐symptom level, duration and improvement over time. The prevalence of recategorised depressive‐symptom trajectories was recalculated from published data. Results We identified six studies, published in 1994–2012, that followed 56–301 bereaved families from eight months to five years. We synthesised five new distinct trajectories (prevalence in synthesised sample): ‘endurance’ (54·2%), ‘resilience’ (8·8%), ‘transient reaction’ (7·7%), ‘chronic grief’ (19·4%) and ‘chronic depression’ (9·9%). The ‘endurance’ group experienced low depressive symptoms throughout the bereavement process. The ‘resilience’ group had severe depressive symptoms when they first transitioned into bereavement, but quickly recovered. The ‘transient reaction’ group's distress lasted 7–12 months postbereavement, gradually returning to prebereavement levels. After bereavement, the chronic grief and depression groups experienced prolonged periods of depressive symptoms, which improved gradually only in the ‘chronic grief’ group. Conclusions Most bereaved families endured their grief and adjusted, returning to prebereavement depressive‐symptom levels within one year postloss (represented by our synthesised ‘endurance’, ‘resilience’ and ‘transient reaction’ groups), with only 9·9% suffering ‘chronic depression’. Relevance to clinical practice Guided by the synthesised distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms, clinicians should identify bereaved families’ depressive‐symptom trajectories and provide suitable interventions to facilitate adjustment of those with chronic depressive symptoms.",0.615477284

While there is evidence of variability in the sexual well-being of new parents, distinct classes of dyadic trajectories have not been established. Sexual frequency, desire, satisfaction, and distress are each unique components of sexual well-being and may follow different patterns of change within couples. We sought to establish classes of trajectories of four aspects of sexual well-being for couples in the transition to parenthood as well as the associations among identified classes. Couples (N = 203) expecting their first child completed online standardized measures of sexual well-being at 20 and 32 weeks in pregnancy and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postpartum. Dyadic latent class growth analyses were conducted to identify classes of trajectories for each facet of sexual well-being, and dual trajectory analyses examined the probability of group membership across classes. Couples' sexual well-being over time was heterogeneous. Sexual frequency had two classes: high (33%) and low (67%); sexual desire had three classes: moderate (36%), high (25%), and discrepant (39%); sexual satisfaction had two classes: high (64%) and low (36%); and sexual distress had two classes: low (76%) and discrepant (24%). Overlap in classes of sexual well-being was variable such that high and low or discrepant (between partners) classes did not always co-occur. Findings provide more nuanced information about new parents' postpartum sexual health, which may facilitate early assessment and intervention.

The present study investigates a comprehensive set of baseline psychosocial risk and protective factors including online behaviors predicting empirically derived PTSS trajectories over time. Females aged 12-16 years (N = 440); 156 with substantiated CSA; 284 matched comparisons with various self-reported potentially traumatic events (PTEs) were assessed at baseline and then annually for 2 subsequent years. Latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) was used to derive PTSS trajectories, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was used to investigate psychosocial predictors including online behaviors of trajectories. LGMM revealed four PTSS trajectories: resilient (52.1%), emerging (9.3%), recovering (19.3%), and chronic (19.4%). Of the 23 predictors considered, nine were retained in the LASSO model discriminating resilient versus chronic trajectories including the absence of CSA and other PTEs, low incidences of exposure to sexual content online, minority ethnicity status, and the presence of additional psychosocial protective factors. Results provide insights into possible intervention targets to promote resilience in adolescence following PTEs.",0.61513629

Latent class growth mixture modeling was used to determine trajectories of physical and psychosocial HRQoL. Multinomial regression analyses were performed to predict trajectory membership. Potential predictors were demographic, stroke-related, and psychological factors.Results: Four trajectories were identified for both physical and psychosocial HRQoL: high, low, recovery, and decline. Comparing the low and recovery trajectories, the groups with low HRQoL were more likely to have higher scores for neuroticism. Comparison of the decline and high trajectories yielded the following predictors of physical HRQoL: discharged to a rehabilitation setting, less acceptance and more neuroticism, pessimism, helplessness, and passive coping. Predictors of psychosocial HRQoL were: discharged to a rehabilitation setting, less self-efficacy, and proactive coping, and more helplessness and passive coping.Conclusions: The present study identified four distinct trajectories of physical and psychosocial HRQoL. The findings indicate that psychological factors are the most important factors in identifying stroke patients at risk of unfavorable HRQoL trajectories. Using these factors will help to identify vulnerable patients and guide rehabilitation in the early stages post stroke.Implications for rehabilitationClinicians should be aware that health-related quality of life follows distinct trajectories stable high, stable low, recovery, or decline, after onset of stroke.Determining relevant psychological factors, in particular helplessness and passive coping, in stroke patients early after stroke is important because these are predictors of unfavorable health-related quality of life trajectories.",0.614729731

This would improve neurodevelopment characterization in order to identify its potential determinants. We aimed to study whether repeated measures of n-back, a working memory task, detect developmental trajectories in schoolchildren during a 1-year follow-up.We administered the n-back task to 2897 healthy children aged 7-11 years old from 39 schools in Barcelona (Spain). The task consisted of 2 levels of complexity or loads (2- and 3-back) and 2 different stimuli (numbers and words). Participants performed the task four times from January 2012 to March 2013. To study the trajectories during the follow-up, we performed linear mixed-effects models including school, individual and age as random effects.We observed improvements related to age in n-back outcomes d', HRT and accuracy, as well as reduced cognitive growth at older ages in d' and HRT. Greater improvements in performance were observed at younger ages, in 2-back, in verbal rather than numerical stimuli and in girls compared to boys. Boys responded faster at baseline, while girls showed increased growth in 2-back numbers. Children with ADHD (Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder) symptoms (15% of boys and 6% of girls) had a lower working memory at baseline, but they showed similar cognitive growth trajectories in numbers variants of the task, as compared to children without ADHD symptoms. However, the age-related improvement in response speed was not observed in children with ADHD symptoms.Changes in n-back outcomes reflected developmental trajectories in 1-year follow-up. The present results suggest that the repeated administration of this task can be used to study the factors that may alter the cognitive development during childhood.",0.614722807

The goal of the current study was to explore the latent class trajectories of three primary response systems theoretically associated with CO2 hypersensitivity: subjective anxiety, panic symptoms, and respiratory rate (fR). Participants (n = 376; 56% female) underwent a maintained 7.5% CO2 breathing task that included three phases: baseline, CO2 air breathing, and recovery. Growth mixture modeling was used to compare response classes (1…n) to identify the best-fit model for each marker. Panic correlates also were examined to determine class differences in panic vulnerability. For subjective anxiety ratings, a three-class model was selected, with individuals in one class reporting an acute increase in anxiety during 7.5% CO2 breathing and a return to pre-CO2 levels during recovery. A second, smaller latent class was distinguished by elevated anxiety across all three phases. The third class reported low anxiety reported during room air, a mild increase in anxiety during 7.5% CO2 breathing, and a return to baseline during recovery. Latent class trajectories for fR yielded one class whereas panic symptom response yielded two classes. This study examined CO2 hypersensitivity in one of the largest samples to date, but did not ascertain a general population sample thereby limiting generalizability. Moreover, a true resting baseline measure of fR was not measured. Two classes potentially representing different risk pathways were observed. Implications of results will be discussed in the context of panic risk research.",0.61470379

Latent class trajectory analysis identified distinct patterns of drug use and depressive symptom trajectories among 231 Latinx adolescents (Latinx sexual minority youth: n = 46, 21.4%; Latinx non-sexual minority youth: n = 169, 78.6%). After identifying class mean trajectories, we examined differences in mean trajectories across groups. A 3-class model was selected as the optimal class trajectory model for both groups, yet classes and trajectories differed. There were differences in initial levels of depression and drug use trajectories between both groups, as well as differences in patterns of drug use trajectories between both groups in two of the three classes. Given the variation in trajectory patterns, there is a need for practitioners to consider the unique needs of both groups to inform the development of preventive interventions for these two populations.",0.61446894

Using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D 10), a trajectory model was classified into different depressive symptom groups by gender. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the association between depression trajectory and all-cause mortality.Results: We identified four trajectories of depressive symptoms in both men and women characterized by low CES-D 10 scores throughout the study: Low trajectory (LT), Moderate high trajectory (MHT), High, but increasing trajectory (HIT), and High, but decreasing trajectory (HDT). The adjusted hazard ratios of the HIT, HDT, and MHT compared with LT in men were 2.12 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-3.16), 1.52 (95% CI, 0.96-2.40), and 1.58 (95% CI, 1.10-2.26), respectively.

Methods: Multivariate linear regression examined the associations between baseline resilience and future mental health symptomatology following repeated trauma exposure. Symptomatology at 6-month follow-up was the dependent variable. Results: The associations between baseline resilience and future posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (P = 0.02) and depression (P = 0.03) symptoms were statistically significant. Those reporting higher resilience levels had lower symptomology at 6-month follow-up. Eighty percent of first-responders who screened positive for low resilience went on to develop more PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Examining resilience may serve as a more effective means of screening, given resilience is a malleable construct which can be enhanced via targeted interventions. Higher levels of resilience may protect the long-term mental health of first-responders, particularly in regard to future PTSD.",0.614205076

This study was designed to examine whether resilience mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and PTSS in 169 Korean conscripts into the Marine Corps. In a cross-sectional study design, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form was used to measure childhood maltreatment, including abuse and neglect. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to measure PTSS and resilience. Structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. Half the conscripts reported at least one type of childhood maltreatment, and 22.3% had high PTSS, even in a short period of service. Childhood abuse was significantly associated with PTSS during military service, a relationship that was not mediated by resilience. However, resilience mediated the relationship between childhood neglect and PTSS during military service. Assessment of childhood maltreatment and resilience prior to military service is crucial for identifying conscripts at increased risk for PTSS during even brief military service. In addition to direct interventions for abuse effects among all Marines, interventions enhancing resilience may benefit conscripts who experienced childhood neglect. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0.614130418

The long-term impact of JFM into adulthood is poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to describe physical and psychosocial outcomes of youth diagnosed with JFM in early adulthood (∼8-year follow-up), examine longitudinal trajectories of pain and depressive symptoms from adolescence to young adulthood, and examine the impact of pain and depressive symptoms on physical functioning over time. Participants were 97 youth with JFM enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study in which pain symptoms, and physical and psychosocial functioning were assessed at 4 time points over approximately 8 years. At the time 4 follow-up (Mage = 24.2 years), the majority continued to suffer from pain and impairment in physical, social, and psychological domains. However, trajectories of pain and emotional symptoms showed varying patterns. Longitudinal analysis using growth mixture modeling revealed 2 pain trajectories (Steady Improvement and Rapid Rebounding Improvement), whereas depressive symptoms followed 3 distinct trajectories (Low-Stable, Improving, and Worsening). Membership in the Worsening Depressive symptoms group was associated with poorer physical functioning over time (P < 0.001) compared with the Low-Stable and Improving groups. This study offers evidence that although JFM symptoms persist for most individuals, pain severity tends to decrease over time. However, depressive symptoms follow distinct trajectories that indicate subgroups of JFM. In particular, JFM patients with worsening depressive symptoms showed decreasing physical functioning and may require more intensive and consistent intervention to prevent long-term disability.",0.61389879

The sample consisted of 138 adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse (96.4% women, mean age = 42.9 years, mean age at the first abuse = 5.9 years), recruited from support centers for sexual abuse survivors. The majority (78.3%) reported penetrative abuse, and a large proportion of the sample reported that the perpetrator was a biological parent (38.4%) or someone they trusted (76.1%), reflecting a high severity level of the abusive experiences. Latent Profile Analyses revealed the best overall fit for a two PTSS-trajectories model; one trajectory characterized by sub-clinical and decreasing level of PTSS (54.9%), and the other by high and slightly decreasing level of PTSS (45.1%). Increased odds for belonging to the trajectory with clinical level symptoms was found among those who reported higher levels of exposure to other types of childhood maltreatment (OR = 3.69, p = 0.002), sexual abuse enforced by physical violence (OR = 3.04, p = 0.003) or threats (OR = 2.56, p = 0.014), very painful sexual abuse (OR = 2.73, p = 0.007), or who had experienced intense anxiety, helplessness or fear during the abuse (OR = 2.97, p = 0.044). Those in the trajectory with clinical level PTSS reported lower levels of perceived social support and more relational difficulties compared to those in the sub-clinical PTSS trajectory. In conclusion, different longitudinal PTSS trajectories can be found among adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Significant predictors of PTSS-trajectory belongingness are discussed alongside their potential implications for preventive efforts and clinical interventions.",0.613796202

The specific aims are 1) to identify subgroups across indicators of well-being and mental health at rehabilitation discharge, 2) to determine the trajectories of well-being and mental health following disability onset, and 3) to test an adjustment model to investigate the mechanism underlying adjustment to SCI.
Methods: The project is embedded within the longitudinal Swiss Spinal Cord Injury Cohort Study (SwiSCI). Currently, around 170 newly injured patients of one of the four Swiss SCI rehabilitation centres have completed questionnaires assessing mental and physical health, well-being and other psychosocial factors during first rehabilitation. We will use exploratory latent profile analysis to identify the subgroups across the adjustment indicators, apply latent growth mixture modeling to detect the trajectories, and structural equation models to test the adjustment mechanism.
Expected results: We expect 1) to identify at least three different subgroups at rehabilitation discharge (resilient, vulnerable, average copers), 2) to find between 3 and 5 different trajectories for mental health and well-being, and 3) to find a direct effect of purpose in life, self-efficacy and social support on well-being and mental health, with partial mediation by appraisals and coping processes.

Using a subsample from the National Institute of Child Health and Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 829), we employed an autoregressive latent trajectory model with structured residuals (ALT-SR) to unpack the trait and state aspects in the relations between parental sensitivity and children's social adjustment. After taking into account trait factors, among all the significant autoregressive and cross-lagged paths originally found in the autoregressive cross-lagged panel models, less than one third of them remained significant in the ALT-SR model. More specifically, in the ALT-SR model, more parent-driven effects were observed for fathers and child-driven effects were detected between children's social skills and fathers' sensitivity. Taken together, it appears that parents' central tendency to be sensitive in the long term is a stable trait, and experiences less state-level fluctuations, and these appear to matter more for children's general tendency to show well adjustment as opposed to change over time.

However, research into these outcomes disproportionately focuses on cross-sectional data in high-income countries. We aimed to (1) investigate change in resilience across two timepoints in a highly vulnerable sample of Syrian refugee children in Lebanon, and (2) explore predictors of their mental health problems across time.In total, 982 Syrian child-caregiver dyads living in refugee settlements in Lebanon completed questionnaires via interview at baseline and follow-up one year later. We categorised children into groups based on their risk for mental health problems across both timepoints (stable high risk/SHR, deteriorating, improving, stable low risk) according to locally validated cut-offs on measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and behavioural problems. Analyses of covariance identified how the groups differed on a range of individual and socio-environmental predictors, followed up by cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) to investigate the directionality of the relationships between significantly related predictors and symptoms.The sample showed a meaningful amount of change in mental health symptoms from baseline to follow-up. Over half (56.3%) of children met SHR criteria and 10.3% deteriorated over time, but almost one-quarter (24.2%) showed meaningful improvement, and 9.2% were consistently at low risk for mental health problems at both timepoints. Several predictors differentiated the groups, particularly social measures. According to CLPMs, maternal acceptance (β = -0.07) predicted child mental health symptoms over time. Self-esteem (β = -0.08), maternal psychological control (β = 0.10), child maltreatment (β = 0.09) and caregiver depression (β = 0.08) predicted child symptoms and vice versa (βse = -0.11, βb = 0.07, βmpc = 0.08, βcm = 0.1, βcd = 0.11). Finally, child symptoms predicted loneliness (β = 0.12), bullying (β = 0.07), perceived social support (β = -0.12), parent-child conflict (β = 0.13), caregiver PTSD (β = 0.07), caregiver anxiety (β = 0.08) and the perceived refugee environment (β = -0.09).Our results show risk and resilience are dynamic, and the family environment plays a key role in children's response to war and displacement. Conversely, children also have a significant impact on the family environment and caregiver's own mental health. Interventions to promote resilience in refugee children should therefore consider family-wide mechanisms.",0.613242351

At three time points separated by 2-year intervals, mothers and fathers reported on their children's aggression and rule breaking (N = 290, M age = 8.8 years at Time 1). At Time 1, parents reported on their children's personality traits and their own overreactivity. Growth mixture modeling identified three aggression trajectories (low decreasing, high decreasing, and high increasing) and two rule-breaking trajectories (low and high). Lower optimism and compliance and higher energy predicted trajectories for both aggression and rule breaking, whereas higher expressiveness and irritability and lower orderliness and perseverance were unique risk factors for increasing aggression into adolescence. Lower concentration was a unique risk factor for increasing rule breaking. Parental overreactivity predicted higher trajectories of aggression but not rule breaking. Only two Trait × Overreactivity interactions were found. Our results indicate that personality facets could differentiate children at risk for different developmental trajectories of aggression and rule breaking.",0.613212479

Mounting evidence suggests that PROs may be useful in elective procedure decision making, but its utility in trauma remains unclear. Longitudinally collected PROs may prove effective in identifying patients recovering below the norm. We sought to document recovery trajectory in patients with and without complication and to evaluate the sources of variability in functional recovery after injury.This retrospective study included 831 patients with trauma, identified via Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for surgical extremity and/or pelvic/acetabular fracture management between 2014 and 2018. Global Physical Health (GPH) scores collected via the PROMIS Global Health in a 14-month window after injury were analyzed using mixed-effects modeling.A curvilinear GPH recovery trajectory was observed where patients demonstrated an initial positive recovery trajectory (B = 1.28, P < 0.001) gradually decelerating over time (B = -0.07, P < 0.001). Patients who experienced complications requiring revision surgery demonstrated markedly lower GPH scores. Several notable predictors of postoperative physical health recovery were identified, including both between-person (B = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.56) and within-person (B = 0.41, 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.46) Global Mental Health (GMH) score, Body Mass Index (BMI) (B = -0.07, 95% CI, -0.12 to -0.02), two or more psychiatric diagnoses (B = -0.97, 95% CI, -1.84 to 0.09), Injury Severity Score 10 to 15 and 16+ (B = -2.62, 95% CI, -4.81 to 0.42 and B = -2.17, 95% CI, -3.60 to 0.74, respectively), readmission for complication (B = -2.64, 95% CI, -3.60 to 1.68), and lower extremity or multiextremity fracture (relative to upper extremity) (B = -3.61, 95% CI, 4.45 to 2.78, B = -4.11, 95% CI, -5.77 to 2.44, respectively). Additional analysis suggests that GMH scores are related to the presence of psychiatric diagnoses.This study establishes a normal course of recovery as reflected by PROMIS GPH score to serve as an index for monitoring individual postoperative course. Patients who experienced a complication demonstrated markedly lower GPH across all time points, potentially allowing earlier identification of at-risk patients. Furthermore, GMH may represent a modifiable risk factor that could profoundly affect physical recovery.Level III (Prognostic Study = Retrospective Cohort).",0.61296091

However, research on the heterogeneity of the longitudinal course of psychological symptoms during the pandemic and the predispositions linked with these courses is still scarce. This study aimed to identify differential trajectories of depressive symptoms among the parents of young children and investigate the role of temperament traits, alexithymia, and coping styles in the heterogeneity of the symptom trajectories. Methods The sample consists of 844 parents from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. Latent growth mixture modeling was utilized to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms from pre-pandemic between 2014 and 2019 (T0, the closest available measurement was used) to May/June 2020 (T1) and December 2020 (T2) during the pandemic. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine temperament, alexithymia, and coping as predictors of symptom trajectories, controlling for various background factors. Results Four trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified. Most parents experienced low and stable depressive symptoms. Negative affect, effortful control, alexithymia, emotion-diverting coping (self-distraction and venting), and avoidant coping (denial and behavioral disengagement) were predictors for subclinical stable depressive symptoms. Constructive coping (positive reframing, acceptance, and humor) protected the cohort parents from increasing or moderately high depressive symptoms. Conclusions The findings have implications for identifying vulnerable individuals with specific traits and strengthening of constructive coping strategies as possible foci in interventions for depression during global crises.",0.612853187

Understanding the joint longitudinal development of the two is of great significance. We conducted a 4-year longitudinal study to examine the joint developmental trajectories of bullying and victimization, gender and grade differences in trajectory group membership, and changes in specific forms of bullying and victimization (verbal, relational, and physical bullying /victimization) in each trajectory group. A total of 775 children from China participated in our study. The average age of participants at the first wave was 10.90 years (SD = 1.12), and boys accounted for 69.5% of the sample. Based on mean scores, four distinct joint developmental trajectories of bullying and victimization were found: the involvement group (both bullying and victimization increased from low to high over time, accounting for 7.6% of the total), the desisted group (both bullying and victimization decreased from high to low over time, 6.1%), the victimization group (victimization remained at a high level, whereas bullying remained at a low level for 3 years, 13.2%), and the noninvolved group (bullying and victimization remained at a stable low level, 73.1%). Boys were more likely than girls to belong to the involvement group, desisted group, and victimization group, whereas girls were more likely than boys to belong to the noninvolved group. There was no significant grade difference in the trajectory group. All forms of bullying/victimization were consistent with the overall trend and showed similar levels. These results have important implications for the prevention of and interventions for school bullying.",0.612670351

Cross-sectional studies showed rather negative impacts on people's mental health, while longitudinal studies considering pre-lockdown data are still scarce. The present study investigated the impact of COVID-19 related lockdown measures in a longitudinal German sample, assessed since 2017. During lockdown, 523 participants completed additional weekly online questionnaires on e.g., mental health, COVID-19-related and general stressor exposure. Predictors for and distinct trajectories of mental health outcomes were determined, using multilevel models and latent growth mixture models, respectively. Positive pandemic appraisal, social support, and adaptive cognitive emotion regulation were positively, whereas perceived stress, daily hassles, and feeling lonely negatively related to mental health outcomes in the entire sample. Three subgroups (""recovered,"" 9.0%; ""resilient,"" 82.6%; ""delayed dysfunction,"" 8.4%) with different mental health responses to initial lockdown measures were identified. Subgroups differed in perceived stress and COVID-19-specific positive appraisal. Although most participants remained mentally healthy, as observed in the resilient group, we also observed inter-individual differences. Participants' psychological state deteriorated over time in the delayed dysfunction group, putting them at risk for mental disorder development. Consequently, health services should especially identify and allocate resources to vulnerable individuals.",0.612445437

Addressing this research objective involved creating a latent factor for cultural stressors, establishing invariance for this factor over time, estimating a growth curve for this factor over time, and examining the effects of initial levels (intercepts) and trajectories (slopes) of cultural stressors on adolescent outcomes. Methods A sample of 302 recently immigrated Hispanic adolescents in Miami (median of 1 year in the United States at baseline) and Los Angeles (median of 3 years in the United States at baseline) was recruited from public schools and assessed six times over a 3-year period. Results Perceived discrimination, context of reception, and bicultural stress loaded onto a latent factor at each of the first five timepoints. A growth curve conducted on this factor over the first five timepoints significantly predicted lower self-esteem and optimism, more depressive symptoms, greater aggressive behavior and rule breaking, and increased likelihood of drunkenness and marijuana use. Conclusions The present results may be important in designing interventions for Hispanic immigrant children and adolescents, including those within the present wave of unaccompanied child migrants. Results indicate targeting cultural stressors in interventions may have potential to improve well-being and decrease externalizing behaviors and substance use within this population.",0.612388491

Methods: A survey was conducted on first-year students from Anhui Medical College and Anqing Medical College, using the Childhood Abuse Questionnaire, Family Disability Questionnaire, Childhood Adverse Social Experience Item, and Anxiety Self Rating Scale. The baseline survey was conducted from November to December 2019, and two follow-up visits were conducted once every six months until November to December 2020. The latent class analysis (LCA) was used to analyze the exposure patterns of ACEs. The latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to analyze the development trajectory of anxiety symptoms. The multiple logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between different exposure patterns of ACEs and the trajectory of anxiety symptom trajectories. Results: A total of 3 662 college students aged (19.2±1.0) were surveyed. The LCA showed that the exposure patterns of ACEs could be divided into the ""high ACEs"" group (13.4%), ""high neglect/emotional abuse"" group (25.7%), ""high family dysfunction"" group (6.9%), ""high neglect"" group (27.1%), and ""low ACEs"" group (26.3%). The LCGA divided anxiety trajectories into four groups: ""high anxiety decline"" (7.1%),""anxiety increase ""(4.1%), ""moderate anxiety""(52.9%), and ""low anxiety""(35.9%). Using the low ACEs group as a reference group, compared with the low anxiety trajectory, the high ACEs group, high neglect/emotional abuse group, high family dysfunction group, high neglect group, and medium to high-level anxiety trajectory were all associated with an increased risk (P<0.05). Conclusion: There is heterogeneity in ACEs exposure patterns among medical college students, and ACEs exposure patterns are important influencing factors for anxiety symptom trajectories.目的： 分析童年期不良经历（ACEs）暴露模式与医学生焦虑症状轨迹的关联。 方法： 以安徽医学高等专科学校、安庆医药高等专科学校大一年级在校学生为研究对象，采用儿童期虐待问卷、家庭功能不全问卷、童年期不良社会经历条目以及焦虑自评量表，于2019年11至12月开始调查，之后每半年调查一次，调查至2020年11至12月。采用潜类别模型分析ACEs暴露模式，潜类别增长模型分析焦虑症状发展轨迹，多元logistic回归模型分析ACEs不同暴露模式和焦虑症状轨迹的关联。 结果： 共调查3 662名大学生，年龄（19.2±1.0）岁。潜类别分析显示，ACEs暴露模式可分为高ACEs组（13.4%）、较高忽视/情感虐待组（25.7%）、高家庭功能不全组（6.9%）、高忽视组（27.1%）、低ACEs组（26.3%）；潜类别增长模型将焦虑轨迹分为4组：高焦虑降低轨迹（7.1%）、高焦虑升高轨迹（4.1%）、中等焦虑轨迹（52.9%）、低焦虑轨迹（35.9%）。以低ACEs组为参照组，与低焦虑轨迹相比，高ACEs组、高忽视/情感虐待组、高家庭功能不全组、高忽视组与中高等水平焦虑轨迹发生的风险增加均相关（P<0.05）。 结论： ACEs暴露模式在医学生人群中存在异质性，且ACEs暴露模式是焦虑症状轨迹的重要影响因素。.",0.612378274

We utilized a convenience sample of 439 CSA survivors attending personalized psychotherapy treatment in Denmark. Four assessments were conducted on a six monthly basis over a period of 18 months. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to test solutions with one to six classes. Following this, a logistic regression was conducted to examine predictors of the identified trajectories. Results revealed four distinct trajectories which were labeled high PTSD gradual response, high PTSD treatment resistant, moderate PTSD rapid response, and moderate PTSD gradual response. Emotional and detached coping and more severe pretreatment avoidance and reexperiencing symptoms were associated with more severe and treatment resistant PTSD. High social support and a longer length of time since the abuse were associated with less severe PTSD which improved over time. The findings suggested that treatment response of PTSD in CSA survivors is characterized by distinct patterns with varying levels and rates of PTSD symptom improvement. Results revealed that social support is protective and that emotional and detached coping and high pretreatment levels of avoidance and reexperiencing symptoms are risk factors in relation to PTSD severity and course. These factors could potentially identify patients who are at risk of not responding to treatment. Furthermore, these factors could be specifically addressed to increase positive outcomes for treatment-seeking CSA survivors.",0.612323208

Further, there is a general increase in depressive symptoms from early to late adolescence, but less is known about how different alcohol habit trajectories are associated with symptoms of depression. The aims of the present study were: to identify trajectories of alcohol consumption and drinking to intoxication during adolescence (age 13–18 years); and examine to what extent the different trajectories of alcohol use were associated with symptoms of depression over the same age span, from early to late adolescence. Methods Data from the N orwegian L ongitudinal H ealth B ehaviour S tudy were employed. Latent class growth analyses were employed to identify different trajectories of both alcohol consumption and drinking to intoxication. The resulting trajectories for each participant were used to estimate the gender‐adjusted association between different development of alcohol use and symptoms of depression. Results Four trajectories of both alcohol consumption and drinking to intoxication were identified. The trajectories with an early onset of alcohol consumption or drinking to intoxication were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms compared with late onset or stable low use trajectories. Conclusions The findings from the present study suggest that early onset developmental trajectories of alcohol use are associated with depression. Therefore, broad assessment and interventions targeting both alcohol and depression may be indicated among early onset alcohol users, especially if they report increasing levels of consumption.

Methods Nationally representative individual‐level data from waves 2 to 6 (middle school to high school) of the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey were merged with neighborhood‐level data drawn from the Korean Census and the Korean Ministry of Education. Latent class growth analysis ( N = 2,178) and logistic regression were conducted ( N = 2,021). Results Three unique trajectories of bullying experience—low‐risk (80.8%), transient (13.3%), high‐risk (5.9%)—were identified. Neighborhood factors (e.g., public assistance receipt, marital status, official bullying incidents, collective efficacy) predicted these distinct developmental paths. Conclusion Joint trajectories of perpetration and victimization can inform service or policy decisions as each developmental path may represent unique experiences for youth in need of specific resources for treatment or intervention.

Design Prospective, longitudinal study. Setting Participants were recruited through a university medical center and participated in follow-up assessments by telephone. Participants Prospectively enrolled individuals (N=212) within 1 week of MTBI who were hospitalized for observation or other system injuries. Participants were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Participants rated average headache pain intensity using the 0 to 10 numerical rating scale at each assessment period. The PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version was completed at 12 months postinjury. Results Latent class growth analysis produced a 4-trajectory group model, with groups labeled resolved, worsening, improving, and chronic. Multivariate regression modeling revealed that younger age and premorbid headache correlated with membership in the worse trajectory groups (worsening and chronic; P<.001). Univariate regression revealed a significant association between PTSD and membership in the worse trajectory groups (P<.001).

To date, posttraumatic growth (PTG) has been studied primarily in the context of significant trauma; thus, it is not known whether stressful life events are associated with PTG. This study investigated the development of PTG among 113 police officers working in the New Orleans area following Hurricane Katrina. Hierarchical regression was used to evaluate if gratitude, social support, and satisfaction with life moderated the relationship between stressful life events (as measured by the total life stress score) and PTG, after adjustment for age, sex, race, level of involvement in Hurricane Katrina, and alcohol intake. Results indicate that stressful life events are independently associated with PTG. Gratitude, satisfaction with life, and social support were seen to moderate this relationship; as stressful life events increased so too did PTG—particularly among officers with higher levels of gratitude (B = 0.002, p ≤ .05), satisfaction with life (B = 0.002, p ≤ .05), and social support (B = 0.001, p ≤ .05). These findings suggest that promoting satisfaction with life, interpersonal support, and gratitude may be beneficial to those who are regularly at risk of trauma exposure.",0.611987309

This study aimed to map the course and overlapping trajectories of mental health symptoms, and associations with PI in a traffic injury population. Methods: In total, 2019 adults sustaining minor-to-moderate traffic injury were recruited within 28 days post-injury and assessed using phone interviews at 1, 6 and 12-months post-injury. Trajectories of DM, PTS and PI were established and relationships between DM, PTS and PI trajectories were explored using dual trajectory modelling. Bio-psychosocial predictors (e.g. pre-injury health, catastrophizing, acute distress, quality of life, social support) of mental health trajectories were investigated. Results: Up to five typical post-trauma trajectories were identified for DM, PTS and PI. Most people were in a resilient mental health trajectory (over 60%, DM or PTS), or in a chronic PI trajectory (almost 60%) 12 months post-injury. While recovery/resilient mental health trajectories were strongly interrelated (73.4% joint probability and &gt;94% conditional probabilities), DM/PTS comorbidity in chronic trajectories was not straightforward, suggesting a possibly asymmetric relationship. That is, persistent DM was more likely associated with persistent PTS (90.4%), than vice versa (31.9%), with a 22.5% probability that persistent PTS was associated with none or milder depression (i.e. following a recovery/resilient DM trajectory). An asymmetrical relationship was also found between mental health and PI. The majority of those with persistent PI were likely to be in a recovery/resilient DM/PTS trajectory (almost 70%), but those in a non-resilient DM/PTS trajectory showed a high risk of persistent PI. Predictors of non-resilient mental health trajectories included poorer pre-injury health and social support, and shared factors like acute psychological distress and pain catastrophizing. Conclusions: Strong interrelations were confirmed between mental health symptoms and PI following traffic injury. However, persistent DM was more strongly linked to persistent PTS, than vice versa. Persistent PI was only linked with persistent DM/PTS in vulnerable subgroups. Early psychiatric/psychological interventions should target elevated psychological distress and negative appraisals in vulnerable individuals, to reduce long-term mental health morbidity/comorbidity and PI.

https://openalex.org/W3002399373,,Trajectories of mobility limitations over 24 years and their characterization by shift work and leisure-time physical activity in midlife,"Background We aimed to investigate trajectories of mobility limitations (MLs) over a period of 24 years. In addition, we aimed to study how shift work and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) in midlife predict assignment to MLs trajectories separately for those retired on statutory pensions (SPs) and on disability pensions (DPs). Methods Subjects who responded MLs questionnaires (1985-2009, N = 3048) in Finnish Longitudinal Study on Aging Municipal Employees were included in this prospective cohort study. LTPA and shift work were measured during baseline. International Classification of Functioning was used to code MLs. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify the trajectories of MLs. Odds ratio (OR) and their 95% Confidence interval (CI) were assessed by using multinomial logistic regression. Results We identified four trajectories of MLs, namely low persistent, low increasing, high decreasing and high persistent. Among the SP recipients, shift work with night shifts was associated with an increased risk (adjusted OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.03-2.14) of belonging to the high persistent MLs trajectory. The inactive LTPA (SP: OR 5.99, 95% CI 3.39-10.58, DP: OR 6.81, 95% CI 2.52-18.43) was similarly associated with high persistent MLs trajectory. Conclusion Nearly two-thirds of the people retired due to disability belonged to high MLs trajectory. High persistent MLs trajectory was associated with physical inactivity in midlife among those retired on SP and on DP. Shift work with night shift predicted high persistent MLs in SP strata. Active involvement in LTPA during midlife could be beneficial to spend MLs free later life.",0.611824299
https://openalex.org/W2940562573,10.1002/da.22902,Trajectories of grief: Comparing symptoms from the <i>DSM‐5</i> and ICD‐11 diagnoses,"Background Diagnostic criteria for prolonged grief have appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5; persistent complex bereavement disorder, PCBD) and in the ICD-11 (prolonged grief disorder, PGD), and the question of which diagnosis is most clinically useful has been hotly debated. This study provides the first longitudinal comparison of PCBD and PGD in their ability to capture symptom change over time and their relation to long-term outcomes. Methods A community sample was recruited consisting of 282 individuals who had recently lost a spouse. Structured clinical interviews were conducted at 3, 14, and 25 months postloss for symptoms corresponding to PCBD and PGD criteria. Outcomes at 25 months included PCBD and PGD caseness, depression, global functioning, and interviewer ratings of participant suffering. Results PCBD and PGD trajectories determined by growth mixture modeling, each captured three primary outcomes: resilience, moderate-improving symptoms, and prolonged-stable symptoms. The PGD solution also identified trajectories of increasing and decreasing distress: prolonged-worsening and acute-recovering symptoms. Prediction of 25-month outcomes indicated differences conforming to the severity of PGD symptoms, and the prolonged-worsening trajectory was associated with the worst adjustment. Conclusions PGD symptoms were more differentiated, better-captured psychopathology, and other outcomes and were more sensitive to change over time compared to PCBD.",0.611403561

The lifestyle of adolescents has undergone severe changes. Almost every school started online education for the first time. Some adolescents have shown low resilience when faced with these changes. Most previous research has focused on mindfulness training and resilience by using cross-sectional or two-point tracking designs. However, little is known about the developmental trajectories of the impact of mindfulness training on resilience, particularly during this epidemic. Therefore, this study aims to explore how the developmental trajectories of resilience are impacted by mindfulness training. After administering the CD-RISC, we recruited 90 students with low levels of resilience in intervention group. Finally, 84 adolescents provided data at each assessment. At the same time, we selected 90 students in the control group. Paired sample t-test was used to compare every factor defined above by time. The result showed that mindfulness training increased students' resilience and emotional intelligence in experiment group. Then in the experiment group, latent growth modeling was used to (1) examine initial levels and changes in resilience over time and (2) predict initial levels and growth in resilience based on emotional intelligence. The findings of this study are as follows: during a mindfulness training intervention, (1) individual resilience tends to increase, and rate of increase grows gradually; there are also significant individual differences in the initial level and development speed; (2) individual emotional intelligence can promote the growth of resilience. With the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, more and more attention is paid to the mental health of students. The research in this article shows that mindfulness training program should be given increasing consideration in the future.",0.611047654

In elderly general population sub-syndromal clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms are highly prevalent and associated with high co-morbidity and increased mortality risk. However changes in depressive symptoms over time and etiologic factors have been difficult to characterise notably due to methodological shortcomings. Our objective was to differentiate trajectories of depressive symptoms over 10 years in community-dwelling elderly men and women using statistical modelling methods which take into account intra-subject correlation and individual differences as well as to examine current and life-time risk factors associated with different trajectories. Methods. Participants aged 65 and over were administered standardised questionnaires and underwent clinical examinations at baseline and after 2, 4, 7 and 10 years. Trajectories over time of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scores were modelled in 517 men and 736 women separately with latent class mixed models which include both a linear mixed model to describe latent classes of trajectories and a multinomial logistic model to characterise the latent trajectories according to baseline covariates (socio-demographic, lifestyle, clinical, genetic characteristics and stressful life events). Results. In both genders two different profiles of symptom changes were observed over the 10-year follow-up. For 9.1% of men and 25% of women a high depressive symptom trajectory was found with a trend toward worsening in men. The majority of the remaining men and women showed decreasing symptomatology over time, falling from clinically significant to very low levels of depressive symptoms. In large multivariate class membership models, mobility limitations [odds ratio (OR) = 4.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6–12.9 and OR = 4.9, 95% CI 2.3–10.7, in men and women respectively], ischemic pathologies (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.0–8.3 and OR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.0–9.9), and recent stressful events (OR = 4.5, 95% CI 1.1–18.5, OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.6–6.2) were associated with a poor symptom course in both gender as well as diabetes in men (OR = 3.5, 95% CI 1.1–10.9) and childhood traumatic experiences in women (OR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.6–5.8). Conclusions. This prospective study was able to differentiate patterns of chronic and remitting depressive symptoms in elderly people with distinct symptom courses and risk factors for men and women. These findings may inform prevention programmes designed to reduce the chronic course of depressive symptomatology.",0.610814505

The PTSD Checklist (PCL), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), State subscale of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) were administered.When the assessments for day 2 and month 12 were compared, all the scales, except the PCL-avoidance subscale, showed a significant improvement in symptoms among males. However, among females, all the scales, except the PCL-re-experience subscale and the STAI-S, failed to show a significant improvement. All the symptoms for both males and females showed a pattern that decreased to the lowest level at month 1 (camp-based controlled intervention period), then increased at months 6 and 12 (voluntary individual treatment after returning to school).The rapid deterioration of psychological symptoms was found during the chronic phase, when students returned to their daily routines and received voluntary individual therapy.

Five years after the initial cancer diagnosis, approximately two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors experience at least one late complication, with one-quarter experiencing severe, life-threatening complications. Chronic health conditions can impact survivors' life planning and daily activities, reducing their health-related quality of life. Comprehensive and longitudinal data are required for investigations of national claims data.This study aimed to address clinical and health policy interventions and improved survival rates. A comprehensive categorization of the long-term morbidities associated with childhood cancer survivorship is required. We analyzed the trajectory groups associated with long-term mortality among childhood cancer survivors.We collected data from a nationwide claims database of the entire Korean population. Between 2003 and 2007, patients diagnosed with and treated for cancer before the age of 20 years were included. With 8119 patients who survived >10 years, 3 trajectory groups were classified according to yearly changes in the number of diagnoses (the lowest in group 1 and the highest in group 3).The patterns of most comorbidities and survival rates differed significantly between the trajectory groups. Group 3 had a higher rate of mental and behavioral disorders, neoplasms, and blood organ diseases than the other two groups. Furthermore, there was a difference in the number of diagnoses by trajectory groups over the entire decade, and the disparity increased as the survival period increased. If a patient received more than four diagnoses, especially after the fourth year, the patient was likely to be assigned to group 3, which had the worst prognosis. Group 1 had the highest overall survival rate, and group 3 had the lowest (P<.001). Group 3 had the highest hazard ratio of 4.37 (95% CI 2.57-7.42; P<.001) in a multivariate analysis of late mortality.Our findings show that the pattern of comorbidities differed significantly among trajectory groups for late death, which could help physicians identify childhood cancer survivors at risk for late mortality. Patients with neoplasms, blood organ diseases, or mental and behavioral disorders should be identified as having an increased risk of late mortality. Furthermore, vigilance and prompt action are essential to mitigate the potential consequences of a child cancer survivor receiving four or more diagnoses within a year.",0.610659498

This analysis aimed to explore latent class trajectories of shelter utilization in a randomized controlled trial of Housing First conducted across five Canadian cities. Methods: Data from the At Home/Chez Soi trial were analyzed (N=2,058). Latent class growth analysis was performed using days of shelter utilization to identify trajectories over 24 months. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine which baseline variables, including treatment group, could predict class membership. Results: Four shelter use trajectories were identified: consistently low (N=1,631, 79%); mostly low (N=120, 6%); early temporary increase (N=179, 9%); and higher use, late temporary increase (N=128, 6%). Treatment group was a significant predictor of class membership. Those enrolled in Housing First had lower odds of experiencing higher shelter use trajectories (mostly low: odds ratio [OR]=0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.34–0.72; early temporary increase: OR=0.21, 95% CI=0.15–0.31; higher use, late temporary increase: OR=0.14, 95% CI=0.09–0.22). Other variables associated with trajectory classes included older age and longer time homeless, both of which were associated with higher shelter use. Conclusions: Several participant characteristics were associated with different shelter use patterns. Knowledge of variables associated with more favorable trajectories may help to inform service planning and contribute to modeling efforts for homelessness.",0.610632389

Research examining predictors of Latino youth depression suggests higher familial values might buffer against youth depressive symptoms (Polo & Lopez, 2009; Zeiders et al., 2013b). However, longitudinal relationships between these variables remain largely unexamined. Furthermore, the literature on longitudinal youth depressive symptoms is mixed, with both increases and decreases being observed over time using group-centered analyses. The present study has three major aims: 1) map the trajectories of depressive symptomology among middle-school age Latino youth over the course of two years using person-centered analyses 2) examine if and how youth, parent, and dyadic (parent-youth) familism (derived using family-centered analyses) predict youth’s depressive symptom trajectories and 3) examine the role of sex and test the interactive effect of sex and youth familism on depressive symptom trajectories. Participants consisted of 133 low-income Latino youth (Mage = 11.90, SD = 0.94) from an urban public middle school in the Midwest, and a subsample of their parents (n = 91). Results indicate three youth depressive symptom trajectories (low stable, recovery, and escalating). As youth familism increased, youth were more likely to belong to the stable low trajectory, relative to the recovery trajectory. Parent and dyadic familism were not related to youth depressive symptom trajectories. Girls were more likely than boys to belong to the recovery trajectory, relative to the stable low trajectory. Sex did not moderate the relation between youth familism and youth depressive symptom trajectories. Our findings suggest using personand family-centered approaches to analyzing longitudinal and parent-youth data (GMM and LPA, respectively) might account for mixed findings in the literature.",0.610561622

Mean scores on health indicators may be masking individual participants struggling with health issues.To investigate different field assignment-related health trajectories among international humanitarian aid workers (iHAWs) and explore the mechanisms used to stay healthy.Growth mixture modelling analyses for five health indicators using pre-/post-assignment and follow-up data.Among 609 iHAWs three trajectories (profiles) were found for emotional exhaustion, work engagement, anxiety and depression. For post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, four trajectories were identified. The 'healthy/normative' trajectory had the largest sample size for all health indicators (73-86%). A stable (moderate) 'ill health' trajectory was identified for all health indicators (7-17%), except anxiety. An 'improving' trajectory was found for PTSD and anxiety symptoms (5-14%). A minority of staff (4-15%) worsened on all health indicators. Deterioration continued for PTSD, depressive symptoms and work engagement 2 months post-assignment. A strong sense of coherence was associated with higher odds of belonging to the 'healthy' trajectory. Female biological sex was associated with higher odds of belonging to the 'worsening' depression and anxiety trajectories. Extended duration of field assignment was related to higher odds of belonging to the 'worsening' depressive symptoms trajectory.Most iHAWs stayed healthy during their assignment; a stable 'ill health' trajectory was identified for most health indicators. Sense of coherence is an important mechanism for understanding the health of all iHAWs in the different health trajectories, including the 'healthy' profile. These findings give new possibilities to develop activities to prevent worsening health and help strengthen iHAWs' ability to remain healthy under stress.",0.61049171

  Milestones of Population Activity Recovery and Their Spatial Inequality","The ability to measure and track the speed and trajectory of a community's post-disaster recovery is essential to inform resource allocation and prioritization. The current survey-based approaches to examining community recovery, however, have significant lags and put the burden of data collection on affected people. Also, the existing literature lacks quantitative measures for important milestones to inform the assessment of recovery trajectory. Recognizing these gaps, this study uses location-based data related to visitation patterns and credit card transactions to specify critical recovery milestones related to population activity recovery. Using data from 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County (Texas), the study specifies four critical post-disaster recovery milestones and calculates quantitative measurements of the length of time between the end of a hazard event and when the spatial areas (census tracts) reached these milestones based on fluctuations in visits to essential and non-essential facilities, and essential and non-essential credit card transactions. Accordingly, an integrated recovery metric is created for an overall measurement of each spatial area's recovery progression. Exploratory statistical analyses were conducted to examine whether variations in community recovery progression in achieving the critical milestones is correlated to its flood status, socioeconomic characteristics, and demographic composition. Finally, the extent of spatial inequality is examined. The results show the presence of moderate spatial inequality in population activity recovery in Hurricane Harvey, based upon which the inequality of recovery is measured. Results of this study can benefit post-disaster recovery resource allocation as well as improve community resilience towards future natural hazards.",0.610424578

Participants included 50 parent-youth dyads (M = 14.5 years) who had been evacuated because of the fire, many of whom had homes that were damaged (60%) or destroyed (30%). For youth, younger age, being female, greater fire stress, more life stressors, and those using more positive reappraisal coping reported greater PTG. For parents, family type and perceived fire stress were positively related to PTG, and positive reappraisal approached significance. For family functioning, only the youth model was significant. Younger age and more life stressors were negatively related, and positive reappraisal coping was positively related, to family functioning. Overall, the results support the important role of positive reappraisal in postdisaster outcomes.",0.610341841

This study examined associations between perceived social support and PTSS in children and adolescents during trauma therapy. Parallel process latent growth curve modeling was used to examine trajectories of perceived social support and PTSS over five measurement waves in a sample of 156 patients, aged between 10 and 18 years (M age = 15.1, SD = 2.2, 79.5% girls), randomized to receive trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) or therapy-as-usual (TAU). Across all participants there was an average decline in PTSS and increase of perceived social support from pre-therapy to 18 months after therapy. Most of the change occurred during therapy and was maintained after therapy. Higher levels of PTSS prior to therapy were associated with lower levels of perceived social support prior to therapy, and a decrease in PTSS was associated with increase in perceived social support. This co-development may have been directed by a third underlying factor or short-term temporal effects.

Close attachment to parents was strongly associated with decreased odds of membership on elevated trajectories. No relationship with a mother or father was associated with better mental health than a poor relationship with that parent. Peer support, teacher support, and educational achievement were highly protective. Romantic relationships, increased number of sexual partners, and prayer were modestly associated with higher depressive symptom burden.

Design Prospective Study. Setting Population-based study drawn from a probability-based internet panel of over 100 000 Israelis. Participants Adults aged 18 years or more, representative of the adult Israeli population. The participants were measured at two time points (time 1 (T1) pre-second lockdown N=1029; response rate=76.17%; time 2 (T2) post-second lockdown N=764; response rate=74.24%). Main outcome measures Trajectories of anxiety and adjustment disorder based on clinical cut-off score for probable diagnoses across T1-T2, somatic symptoms at T2. The four trajectories: stable-low, (no probable diagnosis), stable-high (stable probable diagnosis), exacerbation (no probable diagnosis at T1, probable diagnosis at T2), recovery (probable diagnosis at T1, no probable diagnosis at T2). Results Three anxiety trajectories predicted probable somatic symptoms (stable-high OR=6.451; exacerbation OR=5.379; recovery OR=2.025) compared with the stable-low trajectory. The three adjustment disorder trajectories also predicted somatic symptoms (stable-high OR=4.726; exacerbation OR=6.419; recovery OR=4.666) compared with the stable-low trajectory. Conclusions Our data show elevated somatic symptoms among those whose mental health trajectories were poor, exacerbated and those who recovered following the second lockdown. The presentation of somatic symptoms may mask psychological vulnerabilities, even among those who appear to have recovered from the stressor. This indicates that lockdown may be a double-edged sword and should be carefully administered given these populations vulnerabilities.",0.610170735

This study sought to identify classes of children with similar trajectories of internalising and externalising symptoms after adjusting one domain's symptoms for the other's at the classification stage, and to relate them to emotional and behavioural outcomes in mid-adolescence. We used growth mixture modelling to classify 16,844 members of the Millennium Cohort Study (baseline N=19,244) into distinct classes based on their trajectories, across ages 3,5,7 and 11 years, of internalising and externalising symptoms adjusted for one another. We examined the predictive ability of these classes for depression, self-harm, trouble with police and drug use among 11,134 children with available data at age 14. We identified four classes of children following distinct trajectories of ‘pure’ internalising and externalising symptoms. After adjustments for confounding, those with increasing or initially high yet decreasing levels of internalising symptomatology, and those with persistently high or increasing levels of externalising problems were at increased risk of depression in early adolescence. Having initially low yet increasing levels of internalising symptomatology was additionally associated with an increased risk of self-harm and drug use in early adolescence. We cannot ascertain whether our longitudinal typology of internalising and externalising symptoms holds for outcomes later in adolescence or adulthood. Interventions aiming to prevent depression, drug use or self-harm in mid-adolescence may be more successful if they target children showing increasing internalising symptoms in the primary school years.",0.610080042

This study aimed at investigating the effect of different forms of child maltreatment experienced prior to age 14 (i.e., sexual abuse, physical abuse and exposure to intimate partner violence), and of friend support at age 14 on the psychological distress trajectory from age 14 to 24. Participants were 605 adolescents from the general population involved in a 10-year longitudinal study. Psychological distress was evaluated at ages 14, 16, 18 and 24. Child maltreatment prior to 14 years was retrospectively assessed at 14 and 24 years while perception of support from friends was evaluated at age 14. Multilevel growth modeling indicated that psychological distress followed a significant decreasing curvilinear trajectory, with participants reporting fewer distressing psychological symptoms after 18 years. All three forms of child maltreatment, as well as their cumulative effect, predicted more psychological distress over 10 years above and beyond the protective effect of support from friends. Higher support from friends at age 14 was related to lower distress at baseline andover 10 years, beyond the effect of child maltreatment.

The study also examines how later delinquency (online and offline) varies on class membership. Using longitudinal data of 2351 Korean adolescents, it employs a latent class growth analysis to identify distinct subgroups, each having a similar pattern of delinquent peer association trajectories over a five-year period. The analysis yields three subgroups: early-onset (0.9% of the sample), late peak (3.5%), and normative trajectory (95.6%). The results reveal that low self-control and strain have an exclusive influence on delinquent peer association for only the early-onset group, compared to the normative group. Low self-control partially mediates the strain-peer delinquency relationship in the early onset group. The late peak group has a higher likelihood of engaging in later delinquency and cyber-deviance.",0.609966717

This study aims to explore this relationship using a longitudinal design.Participants were enrolled at 15 gestational weeks. Demographic information was collected. Perinatal depressive symptoms were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Sleep quality was measured employing the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at five timepoints from enrollment to three months postpartum. Overall, 1416 women completed the questionnaires at least thrice. A Latent Growth Curve (LGC) model was performed to identify the relationship between the trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms and sleep quality.Of the participants, 23.7% screened positive at least once on the EPDS. The perinatal depressive symptoms trajectory, fitted by the LGC model, decreased at early pregnancy and increased from 15 gestational weeks to three months postpartum. The intercept of sleep trajectory positively affected the intercept of perinatal depressive symptoms' trajectory; the slope of sleep trajectory positively affected both the slope and the quadratic coefficient of perinatal depressive symptoms' trajectory.The trajectory of perinatal depressive symptoms increased from 15 gestational weeks to three months postpartum following a quadratic trend. Poor sleep quality was associated with depression symptoms beginning at the onset of pregnancy. Moreover, rapidly declining sleep quality could be a significant risk factor for perinatal depression (PND). These findings call for greater attention to perinatal women who report poor and persistently deteriorating sleep quality. Additional sleep-quality evaluations, depression assessments, and referrals to mental health care providers may benefit these women and support PND prevention, screening, and early diagnosis.",0.609835936

This study evaluated common trajectories of these disorders and explored how they co-develop in early childhood.Community parents (N = 273) completed online surveys about their 2-year-old. Children's inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms over 2 years were examined using latent class, dual trajectory, and cross-lagged analyses.Most children followed low symptom trajectories. A small portion showed high, moderate, or increasing trajectories. The hyperactive/impulsive domain of ADHD showed a declining symptoms group. Children in high ODD groups were likely to be in high ADHD symptom groups; the converse was true but probabilities were lower. Hyperactive/impulsive symptoms predicted ODD symptoms across time, more than vice versa.The study extends the small body of literature assessing early development of ADHD and ODD. Findings suggest that earlier intervention for symptoms of ADHD may mitigate risk of developing ODD.",0.609689793

Objective: The present study examines symptom profiles of PTSD and CG among bereaved Sichuan earthquake survivors 1 year after the disaster. Method: Self-report measures of demographic, disaster, and loss-related characteristics and symptoms of PTSD and CG were administered among 803 survivors (63% women; mean age = 46.7 years). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify subgroups of people with different PTSD and CG symptom profiles. Results: The LCA demonstrated that a five-class solution yielded the best fit, consisting of a CG class with low PTSD and high CG (N = 208), a combined class with high PTSD and high CG (N = 205), a class with low PTSD and partial CG (N = 145), a class with partial PTSD and CG (N = 136), and a resilient class with low PTSD and CG (N = 108). Being a woman (vs man), losing a child or spouse (vs other), being injured (vs non-injured), and/or having a missing family member (vs non-missing) predicted membership of the CG class compared to other classes. Conclusions: CG appears to be a unique consequence of disasters involving many casualties. Disaster survivors should be screened for CG and provided with appropriate psychological treatment.Antecedentes: Los estudios en la salud mental luego de desastres se ha centrado principalmente en el trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT), pero el duelo discapacitante y permanente (por ejemplo, duelo complicado, DC) también pareciera ser importante.Objetivo: El presente estudio examina los perfiles de síntomas de TEPT y DC entre los sobrevivientes del terremoto de Sichuan que perdieron a un ser querido, un año después del desastre.Método: A los 803 sobrevivientes (63% mujeres, edad media = 46,7 años), se les administraron medidas de auto-reporte sobre las características demográficas, del desastre, y relacionadas a la pérdida como también síntomas de TEPT y DC. El análisis de clases latentes (LCA en sus siglas en inglés) fue llevado a cabo para identificar subgrupos de personas con diferentes perfiles de TEPT y DC.Resultados: El LCA demostró que una solución de cinco clases presentó el mejor ajuste, consistiendo de una clase de DC con bajo TEPT y alto DC (N = 208), una clase combinada de alto TEPT y alto DC (N = 205), una clase de bajo TEPT y DC parcial (N = 145), una clase con TEPT y DC parciales (N = 136), y una clase resiliente con bajo TEPT y DC (N = 108). Ser mujer (vs. hombre), perder un hijo/a o cónyuge (vs. otro), estar lesionado/a (vs. no lesionado/a), y/o tener a un familiar perdido (vs. no perdido) predijeron la pertenencia a la clase del DC comparado a las otras clases.Conclusiones: El DC surge como una consecuencia única de los desastres involucrando a muchas víctimas. Los sobrevivientes de desastres deberían ser pesquisados por DC y tener acceso a tratamiento psicológico adecuado.背景：有关灾难的研究通常都关注创伤后应激障碍（PTSD），然而持续而强烈的哀伤（即，复杂哀伤，CG）也同样值得关注。目的：本研究探索四川地震一年以后，失去亲人的灾民们的PTSD 和CG症状情况。方法：共有803名丧亲的灾民（63%是女性，平均年龄47岁）完成了自我报告的问卷，内容包括人口学变量，与灾难和丧失有关的情况，以及测量PTSD与CG的问卷。用潜分类分析（LCA）来检测被试的PTSD与CG 症状分组情况。结果：分析结果表明被试的最佳分类是5组，包括CG组：低PTSD和高CG （N = 208），混合组：高PTSD及高CG （N = 205），一组低PTSD和部分CG（N =145），一组部分PTSD和CG (N = 136)，以及复原组：低PTSD低CG（N = 108）。女性（相比男性），失去孩子或配偶（相比失去其他人），有家庭成员失踪（相比无失踪），有家庭成员失踪（相比无失踪）能预测CG组（相对于其他组而言）。结论：在有人员伤亡的灾难中，CG是单独呈现的一组症状。灾难幸存者的CG情况应该被筛查并给予相应的支持。.",0.609552093

This 10-year survey re-assessed the 1999 İzmit, Turkey, earthquake survivors.Methods: İzmit earthquake survivors (N = 198), previously assessed for PTSD/partial PTSD at 1-3 months and 18-20 months post-earthquake, were evaluated 10 years post-event from January 2009 through December 2010. A PTSD self-test (Turkish translation) used DSM-IV criteria to characterize full PTSD, ""stringent partial PTSD,"" ""lenient partial PTSD,"" or non-PTSD based on symptom type/amount.Results: Full PTSD prevalence decreased from 37% at 1-3 months post-earthquake to 15% at 18-20 months (P < .001), remaining relatively stable (12%) at 10 years (P = .38). Stringent and lenient partial PTSD decreased between 1-3 months and 18-20 months (from 9% to 3% and from 24% to 12%, respectively; P < .001), remaining stable at 10 years (5% and 9%, respectively; P = .43 and P = .89). PTSD was more prevalent at 1-3 months among those who had a close acquaintance harmed, had been evacuated for long periods (> 1 week), or had more children; this was not observed at 10 years (P = .007-.017). Avoidance symptoms 1-3 months post-earthquake were the best predictor for full PTSD at 10 years (P < .001). Delayed-onset PTSD was observed in only 2% of participants.Conclusions: Full and partial PTSD decreased over the first 2 years post-trauma, but remained stable at 10 years, suggesting PTSD symptoms at around 2 years remain stable at 10 years. Background characteristics did not predict PTSD long-term course, but avoidance level did. Delayed-onset PTSD was relatively rare.",0.609391849

This study aimed to evaluate the joint developmental trajectories of maternal and paternal psychological distress and child internalizing and externalizing problems from early childhood to middle adolescence. Given that suicide and self-harm are major public health issues in adolescence and often occur in the context of other mental health issues, we also examined the association between these joint trajectories and these outcomes in adolescence. Parallel-process latent class growth analysis was applied to 14 years of follow-up data from a large-scale, nationally representative sample of youths participating in the UK's Millennium Cohort Study (MCS; n = 12,520, 50.9% male). Results showed the best-fitting solution had four trajectory classes: (1) low symptoms, 59.0%; (2) moderate symptoms in children, 22.5%; (3) notable symptoms in fathers, 10.7%; and (4) co-occurring maternal and child symptoms, 7.8%. The trajectory groups differed in their self-harm and suicide attempts in adolescence, underscoring the possible importance of the roles of both parental distress and child problem behaviors processes in these outcomes. Future studies will be valuable to rigorously test the directionality and the respective roles of parents and children in this association. Our findings suggest the need for two-generation mental health intervention programs that are tailored based on co-developmental trajectory group membership.",0.609338464

Methods This study investigated child and adolescent mental health symptoms across four occasions (pre-pandemic, initial lockdown, second lockdown, and society post reopening) using data from the Dynamics of Family Conflict study. Child and adolescent depressive vulnerability, age, and sex were explored as trajectory moderators. Children and adolescents ( N = 381, M age = 13.65, SD = 1.74) self-reported their anxiety, depression, and externalizing symptoms. Mixed effects analyses were performed to investigate trajectories across measurement occasions and interaction terms between occasion and moderator variables were included to better understand the heterogeneity in the impact of the pandemic. Results Children and adolescents reported increases in anxiety symptoms at the second lockdown ( t (523) = −3.66, p &lt; .01) and when society had reopened ( t (522) = −4.90, p &lt; .001). An increase in depression symptoms was seen when society had reopened relative to the three previous measurement occasions ( p s &lt; 0.01). Depressive vulnerability moderated the trajectory for anxiety symptoms ( F (3,498) = 3.05, p = .028), while age moderated the trajectory for depression symptoms ( F (3,532) = 2.97, p = .031). Conclusion The delayed and negative impact on children’s and adolescents’ mental health underscores the need for continued monitoring, and implementation of support systems to help and mitigate further deterioration.",0.608641797

This study assessed bidirectional relationships between PTSD and perceived social support in a large sample of the 9/11-exposed cohort over a 14-year follow-up. We used data from 23,165 World Trade Center Health Registry (WTCHR) enrollees who were exposed to the 9/11 attacks and participated in the first four WTCHR surveys (Wave 1 (2003−2004) to Wave 4 (2015−2016)). PTSD symptoms were measured using the 17-item PTSD Checklist. Perceived social support was measured using the five-item version of the Modified Social Support Survey. We used a cross-lagged panel analysis and found an inverse relationship between PTSD symptoms and social support. PTSD at Wave 2 (W2) predicted less social support at Wave 3 (W3) (β = −0.10, p < 0.01), and PTSD at W3 predicted less social support at W4 (β = −0.05, p < 0.01). Conversely, social support at W3 buffered PTSD symptoms at W4 (β = −0.03, p < 0.05). Sub-analyses by types of perceived social support suggest greater effects of PTSD on emotional support than tangible support and in community members than rescue/recovery workers. Our findings suggest a bidirectional effect between PTSD symptoms and social support in a longitudinal study of 9/11-exposed populations.",0.608274282

However, resilience resources at multiple levels (individual, social, and endowed) may act as a buffer to protect future memory decline, especially in the face of discrimination.Using longitudinal data from the 2006-2016 Health and Retirement Study (N = 1862), we tested whether Black Americans aged 50 and older would show different trajectories of episodic memory depending on their reported experiences of discrimination (everyday and major lifetime) and resilience resources.Analyses were conducted in three steps: (1) joint latent cluster mixed modeling (JLCMM) to estimate the number of classes, (2) barycentric discriminant analyses (BADA) to model the combined influence of discrimination and resilience resources between each memory class, and (3) multinomial regression analyses to explore interactions between discrimination and resilience resources.JLCMM resulted in three memory classes that differentiated baseline from longitudinal memory performance: ""High Decliners,"" ""Low Decliners,"" and ""Low Stable."" Two independent patterns described the relationships between the three classes in the context of discrimination and resilience resources. First, compared with High Decliners, the two lower baseline memory classes (Low Decliners and Low Stable) reported more everyday discrimination and lower individual and endowed resilience resources. Second, although the Low Stable class did not report different levels of discrimination, they had more social resilience resources (greater social support and more social contact) than both declining classes.Black Americans in later life have heterogeneous patterns of memory trajectories as demonstrated by the three memory classes identified. Those with lower baseline memory experienced more everyday discrimination and had fewer resilience resources compared to those with high baseline performance (High Decliners). Greater social resilience resources were associated with maintained episodic memory over time in Black Americans.",0.608203665

Self-report measures at baseline assessed sociodemographic characteristics; trauma exposures; psychiatric and substance use disorders; mental, cognitive, and physical functioning; and psychosocial factors including expectations of aging. Latent growth mixture modeling identified the nature and correlates of 10-year PTSD symptom trajectories.Most of the sample had no/low PTSD symptoms (88.7%), while 6.0% had consistently subthreshold symptoms, 2.7% consistently high symptoms, and 2.6% increasing symptoms. Relative to the no/low symptom group, the subthreshold and high symptom groups reported more medical conditions and cognitive difficulties, with younger age and more lifetime traumatic events additionally linked to the high symptom trajectory. Relative to the no/low symptom group, Veterans with increasing symptoms were more likely to report functional disability and lifetime nicotine use disorder, cognitive difficulties, negative expectations regarding physical and emotional aging, and traumatic events over the study period.Despite high rates of trauma exposure, most older Veterans do not evidence symptomatic PTSD trajectories; however, about 11% do.

Longitudinal data analyses were conducted using cohort sequential Growth Mixture Model (CS-GMM) with a United States national representative sample of children reported to Child Protective Services (n=1,776). Five distinct developmental trajectories from birth to age 10 were identified including two resilient groups. Children who were neglected during infancy/toddlerhood or physically abused during preschool age were more likely to be in the poorer language/academic functioning groups (decreasing/recovery/decreasing and high decreasing) than the resilient high stable group. Child prosocial skills, caregiver warmth, and caregiver cognitive stimulation significantly predicted membership in the two resilient academic functioning groups (low increasing and high stable), after controlling for demographics and child physical abuse and neglect. Results suggest that it is possible for a maltreated child to successfully achieve competent academic functioning, despite the early adversity, and identifies three possible avenues of intervention points. This study also makes a significant contribution to the field of child development research through the novel use of CS-GMM, which has implications for future longitudinal data collection methodology.",0.607821956

Social recovery profiles were examined using latent class growth analysis. Results Three types of social recovery profile were identified: Low Stable (66%), Moderate-Increasing (27%), and High-Decreasing (7%). Poor social recovery was predicted by male gender, ethnic minority status, younger age at onset of psychosis, increased negative symptoms, and poor premorbid adjustment. Conclusions Social disability is prevalent in FEP, although distinct recovery profiles are evident. Where social disability is present on entry into EIP services it can remain stable, highlighting a need for targeted intervention.",0.607659476

Characterizing racial discrimination trajectories, patterns of repeated exposure, may provide insight on age-related patterns of health risk and resilience. However, there is a dearth of research exploring racial discrimination trajectories. This study characterizes racial discrimination trajectories and identifies trajectory correlates among a nationally representative sample of middle-aged and older black adults who participated in the Health and Retirement Study (2006-2018). Repeated measures latent profile analysis was employed to identify racial discrimination trajectories. Logistic regression models, estimating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were conducted to investigate sociodemographic and neighborhood-level predictors of racial discrimination trajectories. Two racial discrimination trajectories were identified: low to moderate (82%) and persistently high (18%). Individuals 65+ (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.64) and female sex (OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.76) were associated with a lower odds of belonging to the persistently high racial discrimination trajectory class. Individuals reporting higher levels of major lifetime experiences of discrimination (OR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.33, 1.63) and greater neighborhood social cohesion (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.50) predicted membership in the persistently high racial discrimination trajectory class. These findings suggest heterogeneity in the cumulative patterning of discrimination among black middle-aged and older adults. Discrimination trajectories may enable greater precision in estimating the health consequences of cumulative exposure to discrimination. Future studies are warranted to determine whether membership in specific trajectory classes confers differential risk to age-related conditions.",0.607178244

Following the 9/11/2001 World Trade Center (WTC) attacks, thousands of individuals were involved in rescue, recovery and clean-up efforts. While a growing body of literature has documented the prevalence and correlates of PTSD in WTC responders, no study has evaluated predominant typologies of PTSD in this population. Participants were 4352 WTC responders with probable WTC-related DSM-IV PTSD. Latent class analyses were conducted to identify predominant typologies of PTSD symptoms and associated correlates. A 3-class solution provided the optimal representation of latent PTSD symptom typologies. The first class, labeled “High-Symptom (n = 1,973, 45.3%),” was characterized by high probabilities of all PTSD symptoms. The second class, “Dysphoric (n = 1,371, 31.5%),” exhibited relatively high probabilities of emotional numbing and dysphoric arousal (e.g., sleep disturbance). The third class, “Threat (n = 1,008, 23.2%),” was characterized by high probabilities of re-experiencing, avoidance and anxious arousal (e.g., hypervigilance). Compared to the Threat class, the Dysphoric class reported a greater number of life stressors after 9/11/2001 (OR = 1.06). The High-Symptom class was more likely than the Threat class to have a positive psychiatric history before 9/11/2001 (OR = 1.7) and reported a greater number of life stressors after 9/11/2001 (OR = 1.1). The High-Symptom class was more likely than the Dysphoric class, which was more likely than the Threat class, to screen positive for depression (83% > 74% > 53%, respectively), and to report greater functional impairment (High-Symptom > Dysphoric [Cohen d = 0.19], Dysphoric > Threat [Cohen d = 0.24]).

Method: Boys and girls are from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development birth cohort (N = 1428). Trajectories of emotional distress symptoms from ages 6 to 10 years, assessed by teachers, were generated using latent class analysis. Multinomial logistic regression analyses examined sport participation at age 5 years, measured by parents, as a predictor of emotional distress trajectory outcomes. Analyses of covariance compared physical activity, measured by children at age 12 years, across different trajectories of emotional distress. Results: We identified 3 emotional distress trajectories: “low” (77%), “increasing” (12%), and “declining” (11%). Boys who never participated in sport at age 5 years were more likely to be in the “increasing” (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–2.63) or “declining” (adjusted OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.28–3.75) emotional distress trajectories compared with boys who participated in any sporting activity. Furthermore, boys in the “low” emotional distress trajectory demonstrated better physical activity outcomes at age 12 years (F(2, 1438) = 6.04, p &lt; 0.05). These results, exclusively for boys, are above and beyond pre-existing individual and family factors. Conclusion: This study supports the relevance of enhancing current public health strategies to understand and promote physical activity and emotional adjustment in early childhood to achieve better a more active lifestyle and overall health across development. We underscore male needs for physical activity for health promotion.",0.607105311

Group-based trajectory modelling was applied to identify asthma symptom trajectories and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between these and environmental factors.Of 5107 children in the LSAC cohort, 3846 were included in our final analysis. We identified three distinct asthma symptom trajectories from age 0/1 year to 14/15 years: 'low/no' (69%), 'transient high' (17%) and 'persistent high' (14%). Compared with the 'low/no' group, children exposed to 'moderate and declining' (relative risk ratio (RRR): 2.22, 95% CI 1.94 to 2.54; RRR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.46) and 'high and persistent' prevalence of maternal smoking (RRR: 1.41, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.60; RRR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.44) were at increased risk of being classified into the 'transient high' and 'persistent high' trajectories of asthma symptom. Persistently bad external dwelling conditions (RRR: 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.51) were associated with 'transient high' trajectory while 'moderate and increasing' conditions of cluttered homes (RRR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.56) were associated with 'persistent high' trajectory of asthma symptom. Exposure to tobacco smoke inside the house also increased the risk of being in the 'persistent high' trajectory group (RRR: 1.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.50).Poor home environment increased the risk of asthma symptom during childhood.

A special group called the ""only-child-lost family"" (OCL family) has emerged and has become a social phenomenon that cannot be ignored. We report latent profiles of posttraumatic growth and their relation to differences in resilience among OCL people in China.A total of 222 OCL people were investigated using the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Latent profile analysis was applied to explore PTG latent profiles. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the socio-demographic variables in each latent profile and the association between profile membership and resilience.Three latent profiles were identified and labeled the ""high appreciation-power group"" (30.6%), the ""general moderate growth group"" (47.7%) and the ""low growth and extreme possibility group"" (21.7%). Compared to those in the high appreciation-power group, individuals with monthly income >2000 ($312) were less likely to be in the general moderate growth group (OR = 0.13, P<0.01), whereas individuals with a spouse were less likely to be in the low growth and extreme possibility group (OR = 0.43, P<0.01). Individuals in the ""general moderate growth group""(OR = 0.92, P<0.01, 95%CI:0.89-0.94) and the ""low growth and extreme possibility"" groups (OR = 0.83, P<0.01, 95%CI:0.79-0.87) demonstrated significantly lower levels of resilience compared to the high appreciation-power group.The PTG patterns in only-child-lost parents were varied. Promoting resilience may be a way to foster these parents' PTG. Targeted intervention should be developed based on the characteristics of each latent class, and timely attention must be paid to the mental health of OCL parents who are without a spouse and have low income.",0.607003368

A previous study showed that CSE affects subsequent PTSS levels, but not vice versa among a sample exposed 0–6 months ago. In this four-wave follow-up study we examined the cross-lagged relationships between CSE and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among those exposed to PTEs (potentially traumatic events) 1–2 years before T1 in order to examine direction of influence. Research questions were: 1) what are the cross-lagged associations between CSE and PTSS levels among those exposed to PTE in the relatively long-term (1–2 years ago, called PTE long-term group), and 2) to what extent do these associations differ from the cross lagged associations among those exposed to PTE in the relatively short-term (0–6 months ago)? Study samples consist of adult respondents of a representative internet panel who experienced a PTE between 1 and 2 years before T1, and did not experience any new PTE between T1 and T3 (long-term group, N = 438) and those exposed in the six months before T1, and not exposed to any additional PTE (short-term group, N = 400). Levels of CSE and PTSS were measured with 4-month intervals. In addition, prospectively assessed personality traits and peritraumatic distress were entered in the analyses. Structural equation modeling showed that CSE perceptions will continue to influence subsequent PTSS levels in the long-term, just as they did in the short-term. Contrary to the more short-term post-exposure period however, CSE levels do not just influence recovery from PTSS. Over time, degree of PTSS experienced also influences subsequent CSE perceptions. Results suggest that while trauma-related CSE perceptions are relatively robust in the short-term recovery period, they can be affected by posttraumatic stress in the long-term.",0.606997745

We excluded patients who had muscle-insvasive disease, underwent early cystectomy, and those with incomplete follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves assessed recurrence and progression-free survival. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis assessed the predictive ability of markers after correcting for EORTC or CUETO risk scores. Harrel concordance index assessed for discrimination.There were 131 patients with a median follow-up of 31.1 months. Stage was Ta (50%), T1 (44%), and Tis (8%). For 95 patients this was the primary tumor. Intravesical therapy was used in 76% of cases of which 45% had maintenance. Recurrence-free survival rates at 6, 12, and 24 months were 68.9%, 52.1%, and 33.2%, respectively, whereas progression-free survival rate at 6, 12, and 24 months were 93.8%, 88%, and 84.3%, respectively. No differences in survival based on number of altered markers were noted. Biomarker status was neither a significant predictor of recurrence nor progression. Marker alterations marginally improved discrimination of EORTC and CUETO models, which were confirmed to be mediocre.Markers were not significant predictors of recurrence nor progression in patients with high-grade NMIBC and their addition to prediction models is of little benefit.",0.606623144

However, their actual mechanism of impact remains under-researched. The aim of this study was therefore to explore protective and promotive resilience mechanisms on both negative and positive mental health outcomes. Promotive resilience is seen as a direct main effect and protective resilience as a moderating effect. Methods Cross-sectional study with 160 Syrian youth aged 13-24 years, who recently resettled in Norway. A multi-dimensional measure for resilience was used to explore the potential impact of resilience factors on pathways between potentially traumatic events from war and flight (PTE), post-migration stress, mental distress and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Analyses included regression, moderation and moderated mediation using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Results A direct main effect of resilience factors (promotive resilience mechanism) was found for HRQoL and general mental distress, but not for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). No moderating effects of resilience factors (protective resilience mechanism) were found. Post-migration stressors mediated the effects of PTE, and this indirect effect was present at all levels of resilience. Relational and environmental level resilience factors and combined amounts had more impact than individual level factors. Conclusions Despite high risk exposure and mental distress, resilience was also high. The direct main effect of resilience factors and less impact on PTSD, suggests universal resilience building interventions may be beneficial, compared to exclusively targeting groups with high symptom levels. These interventions should target relational and environmental resilience factors as well as individual coping techniques. Additionally, reducing current stress and symptoms could increase the efficacy of resilience factors already present. Key messages • Refugee youth may have both high levels of risk and high resilience. • Universal resilience interventions should focus on relational and environmental support, as well as individual resilience.",0.606484793

Although longitudinal studies have reported a general decline in PD symptoms, it is unclear whether there are subgroups of individuals with different PD trajectories from early adolescence to adulthood. This study aimed to examine this question in a large representative community sample and identify early childhood predictors of these varying trajectories. Longitudinal data collected across 20 years from participants in the Children in the Community (CIC) Study, a representative nonclinical cohort, were used. Trajectories of each PD cluster across four waves of assessments were estimated using growth mixture modeling. The extent to which early childhood risk factors were associated with latent class membership was examined. Two distinct trajectories were each identified for cluster A, B, and C PD symptoms from early adolescence into mid-adulthood. Most participants followed a trajectory of decreasing PD symptoms whereas a small proportion showed increases in PD symptoms over time. Individuals with depressive symptoms or a singleparent household in early childhood were more likely to be in the latent class with increasing PD symptoms across time. There is considerable heterogeneity in PD symptom trajectories over time among a large non-clinical sample in the community. Increases in PD symptoms in early adolescence may indicate elevated PD symptoms later in life. Findings highlight the need for early intervention and treatment to guide this subgroup of adolescents towards normative development and a reduction of PD symptoms.",0.60643892

Design, setting, participants REStORing health of acutely unwell adulTs (RESORT) is an observational, prospective, longitudinal inception cohort study of consecutive patients admitted to geriatric rehabilitation wards at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Recruitment commenced on 15 October 2017. Main outcome measures Functional performance, assessed with the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales two weeks before acute hospitalisation, on admission to and discharge from geriatric rehabilitation, and three months after discharge from geriatric rehabilitation. Results A total of 618 rehabilitation patients were included in our analysis. For each of the two scales, three distinct functional performance trajectories were identified by latent class growth modelling: poor at baseline and 3-month follow-up (remained poor: ADL, 6.6% of patients; IADL, 42%), good at baseline but poor recovery (deteriorated: ADL, 33%; IADL, 20%), and good at baseline and good recovery (recovered: ADL, 60%; IADL, 35%). Higher Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score (v recovered, per point: odds ratio [OR], 2.51; 95% CI, 1.64–3.84) and cognitive impairment (OR, 6.33; 95% CI, 2.09–19.1) were associated with greater likelihood of remaining poor in ADL, and also with deterioration (CFS score: OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.45–2.13; cognitive impairment: OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.24–2.82). Higher CFS score (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.37–1.97) and cognitive impairment (OR, 3.60; 95% CI, 2.31–5.61) were associated with remaining poor in IADL, and higher CFS score was also associated with deterioration (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.33–1.99). Conclusions Based on ADL assessments, most people who underwent inpatient geriatric rehabilitation regained their baseline functional performance. As higher CFS score and cognitive impairment were associated with poorer functional recovery, assessing frailty and cognition at hospital admission could assist intervention and discharge planning.",0.606108261

Parental emotion socialization (PES) has been theorized to influence children's behaviors; many studies lend support to this theory. However, longitudinal studies examining PES with experimental designs are sparse. In this study, we estimated PES growth trajectories following a parenting intervention and evaluated whether intervention induced improvements in PES predict child outcomes in postdeployed military families. National Guard/Reserve families with at least one deployed parent and a child aged 4-13 years were randomized into an intervention or control group. Data from all 255 2-parent married families, who were primarily Caucasian and middle-class, were analyzed. PES was indicated by self-reported nonsupportive and supportive reactions to children's negative emotions (baseline, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up). Child behaviors were assessed through averaged mother- and father- reports (baseline and 2-year follow-up). Results of latent growth models showed that mothers and fathers assigned to the intervention condition reported greater improvements in nonsupportive PES (steeper negative slopes) over 2 years relative to controls. Both mothers' and fathers' intervention-induced improvements in nonsupportive PES were associated with decreased child internalizing behaviors. Mothers' intervention-induced improvements in nonsupportive PES were associated with decreased child externalizing behaviors. No significant findings were detected for intervention effects on supportive PES growth trajectories. Our findings supported the indirect effects of the intervention on child behaviors through nonsupportive PES over two years. PES is an important, malleable skill that can be targeted in parenting interventions for postdeployed military families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",0.605959113
